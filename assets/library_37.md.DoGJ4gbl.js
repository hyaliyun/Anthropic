A Greek from Santa Severina, Calabria, he was the last pope of the Byzantine Papacy. Most probably he was a deacon of the Roman Church and as such signed the decrees of the Roman council of 732 and was on intimate terms with Gregory III, whom he succeeded on 5 December 741. - Childeric III ( c. 717 -- c. 754 ) was King of Francia from 743 until he was deposed by Pope Zachary in March 751 at the instigation of Pepin the Short . Although his parentage is uncertain , he is considered the last Frankish king from the Merovingian dynasty . Once Childeric was deposed , Pepin the Short , who was the father of emperor Charlemagne , was crowned the first king of the Franks from the Carolingian dynasty . - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - Pepin the Short (, c. 714 24 September 768) was the King of the Franks from 751 until his death. He was the first of the Carolingians to become king. - The Byzantine Papacy was a period of Byzantine domination of the papacy from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the Byzantine Emperor for episcopal consecration, and many popes were chosen from the \\"apocrisiarii\\" (liaisons from the pope to the emperor) or the inhabitants of Byzantine Greece, Byzantine Syria, or Byzantine Sicily. Justinian I conquered the Italian peninsula in the Gothic War (535554) and appointed the next three popes, a practice that would be continued by his successors and later be delegated to the Exarchate of Ravenna. - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.

Not enough to make me return it but not real happy with it either. Answer:","response":"Based on the analysis of the given product review, it is evident that the reviewer has mixed feelings, leaning towards a negative review. The reasons for this assessment are as follows: 1. The title of the review is \\"Meh...,\\" which typically indicates indifference or dissatisfaction with the product. This term does not suggest a positive or favorable opinion of the product. 2. The reviewer points out specific flaws in the product, such as the fact that the product \\"wasn't fully painted\\" and \\"the shelves all tilted a different way once put together.\\" These observations reveal practical issues with the product's design or construction, which can significantly impact the overall quality and satisfaction of the product. 3. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the product's appearance by stating that \\"from the side it looks stupid.\\" This remark showcases the dissatisfaction with the product look, which can be considered unfavorable. 4. Although the reviewer does not find the product's issues severe enough to warrant a return, they clearly state that they are \\"not real happy with it either.\\" This dissatisfaction shows that the reviewer's expectations were not met, and they most likely would not recommend the product to others, based on their experience. In conclusion, while this review does not exclusively consist of negative comments, the overall impression of the product and the reviewer's dissatisfaction weigh more towards a negative review than a positive one. The reviewer has mixed feelings about the product, and the negative aspects seem to play a more significant role in their overall opinion."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"\\"Je mange une pomme.\\" This sentence is in French, dear kiddo.

I like bad films, as they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. With the exception of the music (which was better than I had expected), this movie had all of those qualities. The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch for include the Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, though, SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well done. The acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been, having been based directly on H.G. Wells' book. For having such good source material, it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over-the-top as to make it funny. And then there's the mustache... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half the movie contains acting. The rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots. To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. With the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes, the bad green screening, it's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie. I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. My advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did: have some friends who enjoy bad movies over, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe you'll make it all the way through.

Colorful: This adjective suggests that the clarkii clown fish has bright and eye-catching colors. The word \\"colorful\\" evokes vivid imagery and contributes significantly to the description of the clarkii clown fish. 2. Clarkii: This word refers to a specific type or species of clownfish, known scientifically as Amphiprion clarkii. It is an essential word that helps determine the identity of the fish mentioned in the sentence. 3. Clownfish: This word indicates the larger family of fishes to which the clarkii clownfish belongs. Clownfish, or anemonefish, are small marine fish known for their striking coloration and interesting symbiotic relationship with sea anemones. 4. Shallow: This adjective provides critical information about the depth and habitat of the reef, suggesting that the reef is not very deep, and therefore may be closer to shore or in an area with ample sunlight penetration. 5. Reef: The word \\"reef\\" is essential because it sets the scene and describes the natural underwater structure composed primarily of coral skeletons and other marine organisms. Reefs are essential habitats and ecosystems for many marine species, including clownfish.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection). Absolute monarchy (such as Saudi Arabia) and dictatorship (such as North Korea) are the main historical forms of autocracy. In very early times, the term \\"autocrat\\" was coined as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of \\"lack of conflicts of interests\\". - This is a list of those who were granted the rank of Feldmarschall by the Holy Roman Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , 1618 -- 1806 .

This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","response":"The name of the Protestant revolt against the supremacy of the Pope is the Protestant Reformation. This was not only a rebellion against papal authority but also a religious, political, intellectual, and cultural upheaval that splintered Catholic Europe, setting in place the structures and beliefs that would define the modern era. The Reformation was a complex phenomenon that called for reform in the Church, challenged the Pope's authority, and led to the establishment and growth of Protestantism. It took place during the 16th century, primarily in Germany, Switzerland, and England. The Reformation was sparked by several key factors, including the Renaissance's promotion of humanism, the invention of the printing press, and the widespread dissemination of religious literature. Central to the start of the Protestant Reformation was Martin Luther, a German monk, and theologian. On October 31, 1517, Luther famously nailed his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" to the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Germany. These theses criticized the Catholic Church's practices, particularly indulgences – a practice where people could buy forgiveness for their sins. Luther argued that salvation was attainable through faith alone, a direct contrast to the Church's teachings. As the movement gained momentum, other key figures emerged, such as Huldrych Zwingli in Switzerland and John Calvin in France. They contributed to the expansion of Protestantism by establishing Reformed and Calvinist churches throughout Europe. These new faiths varied in their beliefs and practices, but they all shared a common rejection of the Pope's supremacy, as well as several key teachings of the Catholic Church. In England, the Reformation took a somewhat different course. King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church partly for political reasons, desiring greater autonomy and control over the English Church and partly for personal reasons, as he sought to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy was passed, which declared Henry VIII the head of the English Church, leading to the formation of the Church of England (Anglicanism).

This long-term price increase has happened in various stages from 1985 up to 2008. The housing bubble can be clearly divided in three periods: 19851991, in which the price nearly tripled; 19921996, in which the price remained somewhat stable; and 19962008, in which prices grew astonishingly again. Coinciding with the financial crisis of 200708, prices began to fall. In 2013, Raj Badiani, an economist at IHS Global Insight in London, estimated that the value of residential real estate has dropped more than 30 percent since 2007 and that house prices would fall at least 50 percent from the peak by 2015. According to Alcidi and Gros note, If construction were to continue at the still relatively high rate of today, the process of absorption of the bubble would take more than 30 years. - Melilla ( \\"Maliliyyah\\") is a Spanish autonomous city located on the north coast of Africa, sharing a border with Morocco with an area of .

The gossip website Gawker.com printed before and after versions of the site, which show that her name has been deleted. They say her name was removed after they contacted the pageant about her alleged porn video. They reported that a YouTube video of the 2012 pageant, showing her and the eventual winner onstage, had been removed from the Miss Teen Colorado USA site as well. The moves came after a woman strongly resembling Althaus appeared on an adult entertainment site, Gawker reports. The video and screenshots from it have gone viral and have been widely circulated on an array of X-rated websites. The subject of the video is asked by a man off-camera to confirm that she is 18. She also states that it is her first adult video. Althaus, whose name was also removed from the Kansas State University directory on Friday, did not respond to an email request for comment. The Miss Colorado USA pageant is the state feeder to the Donald Trump-owned Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. Reps for the Colorado pageant and the Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment. Angie Meyer, a former publicist for the Miss California pageant, looked at the video of Althaus in the Miss Colorado Teen USA pageant, and the porn video, and said she thought they were \\"for sure the same girl.\\" A porn insider said it was a \\"pretty good bet\\" it was the same person in each video. \\"But short of seeing the 2257 model ID and docs, there is no way to say 100 percent for sure.\\" The insider pointed us to the site's 2257 page, which states it is in compliance with the law that all models be over 18 years old. Roger Neal, a rep who has worked closely with the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA branches, told FOX411: \\"The pageant these days seems to like controversy. And the girls (who participate) often see examples daily of reality stars being rewarded for bad behavior, so they figure if they act badly, they will be stars too.\\" Althaus’ Twitter account was also taken down after the report surfaced, but a site that archives tweets still had some of her most recent, including: \\"Trust is like an eraser, it gets smaller with every mistake you make,\\" and \\"There's three ways to do things ... the right way, the wrong way and the way I do it.\\" Miss Teen USA has rules; one is that contestants can't be married or have been married. State organizers may also have their own contracts with moral clauses. Meyer told us there is an unwritten ethical obligation for the participants to uphold traditional values when it comes to a high-profile pageant such as Miss Teen USA. \\"There shouldn't be a question if these types of actions are justified in the pageant world - they aren't,\\" she said. \\"What a poor example this sets for teenage girls across the country.\\" Tom Hynes, senior editor of AVN (Adult Video Network) Magazine, said women are paid a few hundred to 1,000 for videos such as the one Althaus allegedly made. He questioned why such a big deal is being made of the incident, especially given that Althaus, if she’s the woman in the video, doesn't appear to have broken the rules while she was in the pageant. \\"Looks to me like she won runner-up two years ago fair and square and is being 'punished' retroactively for behavior undertaken well after the year she won is already over,\\" Hynes said. \\"It's the pageant organizers who seem out-of-control here. They brought this on themselves by erasing any mention of her.\\" Althaus is not the first pageant queen to be embroiled in a porn scandal. In 2012, Miss Delaware Teen USA relinquished her crown amid allegations that she had made a porn video. Then there was 2012’s Miss Nevada, who risked losing her title after risqué photographs of her posing lewdly with porn king Ron Jeremy were cited on her Facebook page. A few years earlier, 2006’s Miss Nevada Katie Rees was stripped of her sash after naughty snaps of her in less-than-ladylike positions made their way onto social media. Carrie Prejean, Miss California USA 2009, was also fired after a personal sex tape she made surfaced. The most famous case is probably that of Vanessa Williams, who gave up her Miss America crown after nude photos of her with another woman surfaced in Penthouse magazine in 1993. She survived the scandal and went on to a very successful singing and acting career. Danielle Jones-Wesley contributed to this report.

She had run down the stairs and out into the street blindly, filled only with that passion for escape which had swept her away from Mervo. Not till she had dived into the human river of Broadway and reached Times Square did she feel secure. Then, with less haste, she walked on to the park, and sat down on a bench, to think. Inevitably she had placed her own construction on John's sudden appearance in New York and at the spot where only one person in any way connected with Mervo knew her to be. She did not know that Smith and he were friends, and did not, therefore, suspect that the former and not herself might be the object of his visit. Nor had any word reached her of what had happened at Mervo after her departure. She had taken it for granted that things had continued as she had left them; and the only possible explanation to her of John's presence in New York was that, acting under orders from Mr. Scobell, he had come to try and bring her back. She shuddered as she conjured up the scene that must have taken place if Pugsy had not mentioned his name and she had gone on into the inner room. In itself the thought that, after what she had said that morning on the island, after she had forced on him, stripping it of the uttermost rag of disguise, the realization of how his position appeared to her, he should have come, under orders, to bring her back, was well-nigh unendurable.

In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - SEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA). It is used broadly throughout South Korean industry, but seldom found elsewhere. It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard. However, this decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea, as no major SSL libraries or web browsers supported the SEED algorithm, requiring users to use an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer for secure web sites. - In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is an indehiscent fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, \\"lignified\\" stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flowerin an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry. - Pan de coco , literally \`\` coconut bread '' in Spanish , is a rich sweet roll with a coconut filling . - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The Arecaceae are a botanical family of perennial climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees commonly known as palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae). They are flowering plants, a family in the monocot order Arecales. Currently 181 genera with around 2600 species are known, most of them restricted to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts. - The coconut tree (\\"Cocos nucifera\\") is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\". The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word.

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it.

The premise states that the individual in question was appointed as a dictator for life but was then assassinated by Brutus, among others, on the Ides of March, 44 B.C. Breaking down the premise: 1. This individual was appointed as a dictator for life, which means they held a powerful position in their society. 2. The person was assassinated by Brutus and some other people. The mention of Brutus suggests that the person being referred to might be Julius Caesar from the famous Roman Republic. Julius Caesar was indeed betrayed and assassinated by Brutus, along with other conspirators, as part of a plan to restore the Roman Republic and curb the increase of power Caesar was accumulating. 3. The assassination took place on the Ides of March, which falls on March 15. This is also historically correct, as Julius Caesar was assassinated on this day. 4. The premise specifies the event occurred in 44 B.C., which is consistent with the historical timeline of Julius Caesar's assassination. Based on these key points, we can confirm that the hypothesis, \\"In 44 B.C., he was\\", is entailed by the premise, as it encompasses all the information presented and accurately describes the circumstance and the actions that occurred in that year. The hypothesis in this context implies that the individual (possibly Julius Caesar) met their fate through assassination in 44 B.C."},{"question":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: have kids you know career to to much into my career you know Sentence 2: I would rather have kids than my career right now. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Choose from: *yes; *it is not possible to tell; *no;","response":"The correct answer is *it is not possible to tell; Sentence 1: \\"have kids you know career to to much into my career you know\\" is grammatically incoherent and does not clearly express a complete thought or intention. The lack of proper structure and context in the sentence makes it hard to understand the exact sentiment or meaning intended by the speaker. It has words related to 'kids' and 'career', but the arrangement of these words does not yield a clear, comprehensible message. Sentence 2: \\"I would rather have kids than my career right now.\\" This sentence clearly expresses a preference for having children over focusing on a career at the present time. Although both sentences contain similar elements (children and career), the actual connection or correlation between the two isn't clear. We cannot confirm the truth of Sentence 2 based on Sentence 1 due to the latter's incoherent and ambiguous statement. Thus, in this situation, as an AI, we cannot definitively say whether the second sentence is true if the first one is, because the first sentence does not provide us with enough understandable information."},{"question":"Definition: Languages typically provide more than one grammatical construction to express certain types of messages.

Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Paragraph: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would sample D make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?","response":"Given the information in the paragraph, sample D is classified as autotrophic. Autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through the process of photosynthesis. Therefore, sample D would make its own glucose rather than acquiring it from other organisms."},{"question":"because there are 1,000 different receptor proteins, there are also 1,000 different receptor neurons.

Question: suppose \\"kidneys filter the bodys fat\\" happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","response":"In this scenario, if the kidneys were to filter the body's fat, we need to consider how this new function affects the waste removal process as described in the original question. Let's analyze step by step: 1. Blood enters the kidney. 2. The blood travels into the nephrons. 3. Waste is expelled via the nephrons, along with the added step of filtering fat. 4. The waste, now including the filtered fat, goes to the bladder in the form of urine. 5. The clean (and now fat-free) blood exits the kidneys. Now, considering the hypothesis that the kidneys filter the body's fat, the question asks how this would affect the waste removal process - specifically, how does this perturbation influence \\"LESS waste being removed from the body\\"? To analyze the influence of the perturbation, we should analyze how the filtration of fat interacts with the waste removal process. If the kidneys filter the body's fat, there would be an additional substance being removed from the blood in the nephrons. This could put an extra load on the kidney's filtration system. However, this added filtration of fat does not necessarily mean less waste is being removed from the body. Instead, it means an increased amount of waste is removed, as it now includes fats. In conclusion, the added function of the kidneys filtering the body's fat would have an effect on the waste removal process, but it would be expected to result in more waste being removed from the body rather than less. Thus, the answer to the question is 'more'."},{"question":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: Theatre is a building or outdoor area in which plays, and other dramatic performances are given.

List the possible chemicals: First, I would list down the possible chemicals that are known to produce red flames when burned. Rationale: This helps in identifying the options available, as different chemicals may result in red flames for various reasons, including chemical composition, reaction with other elements, and the temperature at which they burn. 2. Analyze safety and accessibility: Next, I would analyze the safety of each listed chemical, considering factors such as toxicity, flammability, and environmental impact. Additionally, I would assess the accessibility of these chemicals - whether they can be easily acquired or if they require special permits/licenses. Rationale: Considering safety and accessibility are crucial to ensure that using the chemical will not cause harm to people or the environment and can realistically be obtained. 3. Rank the chemicals based on the criteria: After evaluating the safety and accessibility of the chemicals, I would rank them based on these criteria, giving higher preference to chemicals that are safer and more accessible.

Second question: Do you live happy? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options: [i] no. [ii] yes.","response":"First, let's analyze both questions and provide answers to them. Afterward, we will determine if they are asking the same thing or not. Question 1: Will we live to be happy? This question addresses the purpose and quality of human existence. It asks whether people generally aspire to live a life in pursuit of happiness and ultimately achieve happiness during their lifetimes. To provide a detailed answer, let's consider the following points: 1. The concept of happiness varies from person to person. For some, happiness might mean achieving professional success, while for others, it could be about spending time with family or finding inner peace. 2. Throughout history, humans have pursued happiness in various forms. For example, spiritual seekers have sought it through meditation, philosophers have discussed it in their works, and artists have expressed it in their art. 3. Social and economic factors play a significant role in determining an individual's prospects for happiness. Research has shown that people with higher incomes, better health, and supportive networks tend to report higher levels of happiness. 4. Happiness often involves striking a balance between different aspects of life, such as work, relationships, and personal growth. Adopting a balanced lifestyle can help individuals live happy lives. In conclusion, whether we live to be happy depends on individual interpretations of happiness and how effectively one navigates life's complexities. Question 2: Do you live happy? Since I am an AI, I do not have the capacity for emotions or personal experiences like happiness, joy, or sadness. My primary purpose is to assist and provide relevant information to users. Consequently, I don't \\"live\\" in the same sense that a human does. Thus, the concept of happiness is not applicable in the context of AI. Now, let's determine if both questions are asking the same thing: First question deals with the human population, their aspirations, and the possibility of achieving happiness while alive. The second question is specifically addressed to me, an AI entity, and inquires about my emotional state and personal experience, which I do not possess. Based on these differences, we can conclude that these two questions are not asking the same thing. Hence, according to the given options, the answer is: [i] no."},{"question":"Do these mean the same? The village has three schools -- a primary and two secondary schools . The village has three schools - a secondary and two primary schools .","response":"No, these two statements do not mean the same. They provide information about the types and numbers of schools in the village, but the distribution of primary and secondary schools is different in each statement. Let's break down the differences: 1. In the first statement: \\"The village has three schools -- a primary and two secondary schools.\\" This conveys that there are three schools in the village, out of which one is a primary school, and the other two are secondary schools. Primary schools usually cater to younger students, generally from ages 5 to 11 years, offering education from grades Kindergarten to 5th or 6th grade. On the other hand, secondary schools serve older students, typically from ages 11 or 12 to 18, offering education from around 6th or 7th grade to 12th grade. 2. In the second statement: \\"The village has three schools - a secondary and two primary schools.\\" This statement also communicates that there are three schools in the village. However, in this case, one of them is a secondary school, while the other two are primary schools. Again, primary schools cater to younger students, whereas secondary schools serve older ones. In conclusion, although both statements refer to a village with three schools, they describe different distributions of primary and secondary schools. The first statement indicates that there is one primary and two secondary schools, while the second statement reveals that there is one secondary and two primary schools in the village. This important distinction affects the education options available to the community in the village."},{"question":"Write an article with the title: \\"Painful prescription\\"","response":"Title: Painful Prescription Once upon a time, in a little town, people sometimes felt bad or got sick. When that happened, they would visit a special person called a \\"doctor\\". Doctors are like big friends who help you feel better when you have a boo-boo or a cough. They are really smart, and they know how to fix a lot of health problems that people have. One day, Mr. Thompson got a headache, and he decided to visit Dr. Friendly, the town's favorite doctor. When Mr. Thompson got to Dr. Friendly's office, he told the doctor about how his head was hurting. Dr. Friendly listened carefully, and he thought about a way to help Mr. Thompson's headache go away. Sometimes, to make people feel better, doctors give them something called a \\"prescription.\\" This is like a special note with a secret code on it. The secret code tells another big helper, called a \\"pharmacist,\\" what kind of medicine the doctor thinks will make the person feel better. Dr. Friendly gave Mr. Thompson a prescription for some medicine that would help his headache stop hurting. But Dr. Friendly also warned him that the medicine might make his tummy feel a little funny, so he should eat something when he took the medicine. This was a \\"painful prescription\\" - it could help Mr. Thompson's headache but might also make him feel a bit uncomfortable at first. Because he trusted Dr. Friendly, Mr. Thompson took the prescription to the pharmacy, where Ms. Right, the pharmacist, read the secret code and gave him the medicine that Dr. Friendly thought would help him. After buying the medicine, Mr. Thompson went home, ate some food, and took the medicine. Just like Dr. Friendly had warned him, his tummy felt a bit funny at first. But soon enough, his headache went away, and he felt much better. Even though the prescription was a bit painful, it helped Mr. Thompson feel better in the end.

If you're enjoying your life as an introvert, that means you're finding happiness in a different way, and that's great! Now, for your second question, there's this place called Quora where people can ask questions and get answers. And yes, there's a helper tool for Google Chrome called Quora Notifier. It's a bit like the helper tool for Reddit called Notifier for Reddit. Both of these tools help you know when there's something new happening on those websites.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Not Like Everyone Else Context: Shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, Union Intermediate High School (in Tulsa, Oklahoma) was one of many schools around the country increasing security measures to prevent school shootings. Brandi Blackbear wrote horror stories similar to those of Stephen King, dressed in a slightly Gothlike way, and was not afraid to be herself, or to stand up to bullying by popular kids. Her defiance engendered hostility toward her from certain segments of her school's culture. False stories of threats of violence were circulated, and the combination of her writing and authorities' natural hyperawareness following Columbine led to her being suspended. When some of her fellow students later saw her checking out a book on world religions, including Wicca (as research for her stories), they immediately branded her a witch, and eventually accused her of casting a spell that made a teacher sick. Fear of her spread through much of the school, and she was once again suspended. Finally, her parents went to the ACLU, where they were told they had a good case against the school for violating her civil rights. The ACLU sued the affluent school for 10 million, even though the Blackbears were not sure they deserved that much based on what Brandi had suffered. Still, the ACLU argued that the school would not take any lesser claim seriously. When the school offered a settlement, the Blackbears refused. They were not interested in the money, despite needing it; what they really wanted was to have their story heard in court to inform the public that the school had mistreated Brandi. The judge ruled to dismiss the charges rather than going to trial, and ordered the Blackbears to pay 6000 in court fees, which they could not afford. Eventually it was agreed to drop the fees if the Blackbears dropped their appeal. Earlier that day at school however, Kimberly (the most popular girl in school, and Brandi's main tormentor) tries to interview Brandi for the school newspaper but she declines, and also, everyone at school expresses...

Given the context: How would Jan feel afterwards? Possible answers: jealous, ashamed, accomplished Answer:","response":"After Jan applied themself to their school work and received an A+ as a result, it is most likely that Jan would feel accomplished. This feeling of accomplishment is founded on several factors. Firstly, Jan put in considerable effort and dedication to their school work, which demonstrates a strong commitment to their education. By working hard and focusing on their studies, they were able to achieve a high level of academic success. Such an outcome is likely to provide a sense of personal satisfaction and increased self-esteem, as it affirms Jan's capacity to excel in their pursuits. Moreover, obtaining an A+ grade is an external validation of Jan's hard work and capabilities. It serves as a quantifiable measure of their performance, signifying that they not only met but exceeded the expectations set by their educators. This recognition is an important part of feeling accomplished, as it validates the time and energy Jan invested in their school work. In the context of the question, the other possible answers, jealous and ashamed, are unlikely to describe Jan's emotions. Feelings of jealousy typically arise when someone perceives that they lack something that another person has, such as a specific skill, opportunity, or material possession. In this scenario, Jan has attained a high level of achievement and has no apparent reason to be envious of others. Thus, jealousy would be an inappropriate response to their success. Similarly, feelings of shame often stem from a perception of failure or inadequacy, usually in response to a specific incident or behavior. As the scenario highlights Jan's accomplishments and efforts, it is improbable that they would feel ashamed. Rather, the opposite is true: Jan's experience of receiving an A+ for their hard work would likely instill feelings of pride and self-confidence. In conclusion, given the context, Jan would most likely feel accomplished after applying themself to their school work and subsequently receiving an A+. This sense of accomplishment stems from their personal satisfaction, increased self-esteem, and the external validation of their dedication and capabilities. With no apparent reasons for jealousy or shame, it is reasonable to assert that Jan would enjoy the positive, rewarding feeling of accomplishment following their academic success."},{"question":"Translate to French: Any system used to arrest the impactor or pendulum shall be so arranged that the arresting phase does not overlap in time with the initial impact.","response":"En français, cela pourrait être dit comme suit : \\"Tout système utilisé pour arrêter l'impacteur ou le pendule doit être organisé de telle manière que la phase d'arrêt ne se chevauche pas dans le temps avec l'impact initial.\\" Explication pour un enfant de 5 ans : \\"On dit que si on a un truc pour arrêter un objet qui frappe (comme un pendule), il faut être sûr que l'arrêt se passe après le moment où l'objet touche quelque chose, pas en même temps.\\""},{"question":"Teacher:Craft one correct answer to the question given in input.

Bailey Cahall is a research associate at the New America Foundation. (CNN) -- The detainee hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay is entering its third month. Official reports say 100 of the detainees remaining at the detention camp are refusing food; lawyers for the detainees say the number is closer to 130. Twenty-three are being force-fed through nasal feeding tubes and at least 40 additional medical personnel have been flown to the base to help the overwhelmed staff care for those protesting their detention. Last week, President Obama reaffirmed his position that the detention camp at Guantanamo needs to be closed and that keeping detainees there without charge indefinitely \\"is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop.\\" Closing Guantanamo was one of Obama's key 2008 campaign promises. Five years later, the prison complex is populated with 166 detainees, 86 of whom have been approved for transfer to other countries, and is being considered for a 200 million renovation. Nearly 70% of the almost 800 detainees who have been held at Guantanamo were released by the Bush administration. Since then, some U.S. officials have become increasingly worried about former detainees joining militant groups. A key reason Guantanamo remains open is the fear that released inmates would mount terrorist attacks against the United States, its interests and its allies. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, for instance, last year called Guantanamo detainees \\"crazy bastards that want to kill us all\\". This view appears to be substantiated by government reports claiming many released inmates go on to join terrorist groups. Last year the U.S. Director of National Intelligence issued an \\"unclassified summary\\" estimating that the number of released detainees confirmed (15.9 percent) or suspected (12.0 percent) of joining militant groups was 27.9 percent. It is impossible to assess the validity of the government's assertion that more than a quarter of former Guantanamo detainees are confirmed or suspected to have joined a militant group because the government has not publicly released the names of former detainees who have \\"returned to the battlefield\\" since April 2009. The New America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports, news stories, and other publicly available documents to create a list of former detainees who have either joined or are suspected of joining militant groups since their release. The list is available here. Of the 603 former detainees who have been transferred out of the prison camp, we identified only 17 individuals (2.8 percent) who are confirmed to be engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities against the United States or its citizens, while there are 21 individuals (3.5 percent) who are suspected of engaging in such activities. We also identified 15 former detainees who are confirmed or are suspected of militant attacks against non-U.S. targets (2.5 percent). For the purposes of our study, for a former detainee to be considered \\"confirmed\\" that he had joined a militant group, there had to be a preponderance of information claiming he was directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities. For those \\"suspected\\" of such acts, there were plausible but unverified accounts about their involvement in such activities. Released prisoners who simply made anti-American statements or propaganda were not considered to be confirmed or suspected to be part of a militant group. While it is possible there are some former detainees participating in terrorist and insurgent activities who have not been identified publicly, we are confident that our numbers are reasonably accurate because groups like al-Qaeda and the Taliban are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks and the media is also quick to highlight such stories. Based on the public record, even if you combine all the released Guantanamo prisoners who are confirmed or suspected to have taken part in any form of militant activity anywhere in the world, the total comes to 53, or 8.8%, which is much lower than the 27% being cited by the U.S. intelligence community. This 8.8% rate is also far smaller than the recidivism rate of criminals in the United States, which currently stands around 67.5%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Interestingly, all but one of these former Guantanamo detainees who joined militant groups were released under the Bush administration. Under Obama, comprehensive threat assessments have been used to determine a detainee's eligibility for release, which has contributed to the fact that of the 72 prisoners released under Obama we were only able to find one who had joined a militant group after his release. Still, even if the number of Guantanamo prisoners who have \\"returned to the battlefield\\" is quite small, they are certainly dangerous. Take Said Ali al-Shiri, who co-founded Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009. Transferred to Saudi Arabia in November 2007 during the George W. Bush administration, al-Shiri completed the kingdom's rehabilitation program and promptly headed to Yemen, where he became AQAP's deputy commander. Another example is Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul, who has emerged as a senior Taliban commander. Rasoul was also transferred from Guantanamo to Afghanistan in 2007 by the Bush administration and rejoined the Taliban shortly after the Afghan government released him from custody. In 2009, after the Yemen-based AQAP claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day, Obama issued a moratorium on all detainee transfers to Yemen. Of the 86 detainees currently approved for transfer out of Guantanamo, 56 are from Yemen. Congress then passed, and Obama signed, the Defense Authorization Act of 2011 which barred the use of government funds to transfer detainees into the United States or into the custody of other countries unless certain security concerns, like maintaining effective control over the detention facility housing the detainees, could be met. So far, it has been close to impossible for countries in the Middle East and South Asia, where most of the remaining detainees are from, to meet the standards set in this legislation. Yet the fact remains that 86 of the prisoners in Guantanamo were cleared for release three years ago following a year-long investigation of their cases by an interagency task force of officials at the Department of Justice, Pentagon, State Department and the Department of Homeland Security. These detainees, some now on hunger strike, have good reason to despair that they will remain in Guantanamo forever. Their cases have been exhaustively investigated. They have found to be guilty of nothing, yet they are being held indefinitely. Indefinite detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships, not democracies. Add to this the facts that less than 3% of the detainees at Guantanamo can be confirmed by the public record to have engaged in anti-American terrorism or insurgent actions following their release and those 17 detainees were all released before the intensive review of the cases of the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo began under the Obama administration in 2009. And so the Guantanamo prisoners who have been cleared for release remain in seemingly perpetual custody, not because they've been charged or because the rate of former detainees joining militant groups is at all high, but because Washington politics has effectively ensured that there is nowhere else for them to go. For these prisoners, attempting to starve themselves to death is an almost rational response to their bleak future. It's a story that Kafka might have written. Unfortunately, this one is true.

The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes.

Samantha is considered to be the better dog breeder than Patricia, so Available options: [1]. Samantha must do crappier on the AKC inspection. [2]. Patricia must do crappier on the AKC inspection.","response":"Samantha is considered to be the better dog breeder than Patricia, so it might be natural to assume that Samantha would perform better on the American Kennel Club (AKC) inspection. However, this is not necessarily always the case. Before determining which breeder may perform better or worse during an AKC inspection, it is essential to understand the inspections and the factors that can influence each breeder's performance. The AKC inspections exist to ensure that breeders adhere to the AKC's Care and Conditions Policy, provide proper living conditions for the dogs, and maintain accurate records for dog registrations. AKC inspectors evaluate breeders using a set of specific criteria, including cleanliness, proper maintenance of facilities, overall dog health, and accuracy of record keeping. Inspectors also ensure that breeders adhere to the AKC's policy on minimum age for breeding, as well as other ethical guidelines. Given Samantha's reputation as the better dog breeder, option 2] would seem more likely: Patricia must do crappier on the AKC inspection. However, it is important to consider various aspects that could influence their performance during inspections: 1. Experience and Expertise: Samantha's superiority as a dog breeder could arise from her extensive experience, knowledge of breed standards, and ethical breeding practices. These factors may contribute to a higher AKC inspection score. On the other hand, Patricia might lack the necessary expertise, which could reflect in her performance during inspections. 2. Cleanliness and Maintenance: AKC inspections evaluate the cleanliness and maintenance of breeding facilities. Samantha may maintain her facilities well, which may be one factor that makes her a better dog breeder. If Patricia does not pay close attention to cleanliness and maintenance, her inspection score may be lower than Samantha's. 3. Dog Health: A significant consideration during AKC inspections is the overall health of the dogs. Samantha may prioritize the wellbeing of her dogs more than Patricia, which could lead to better inspection scores. Trained inspectors will assess the dogs for signs of sickness or injury, ensuring they are well-cared for and healthy. 4. Record Keeping: AKC inspections also involve verifying the accuracy of dog registration records. If Samantha is a more organized breeder with accurate records, her inspection scores would be higher than Patricia's, who may struggle to keep consistent documentation. 5. AKC Compliance: If Samantha adheres to the AKC's guidelines for breeding more closely than Patricia, this could also contribute to her higher inspection scores. Conversely, if Patricia fails to meet AKC standards, she is likely to perform worse on inspections. In conclusion, based on the available information, option 2] Patricia must do crappier on the AKC inspection is the more likely scenario, given Samantha's reputation as a superior dog breeder. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that various factors could impact their inspection results, such as experience, cleanliness, dog health, record keeping, and adherence to AKC guidelines. Ultimately, the AKC inspection scores should be analyzed in conjunction with other indicators to ensure breeders like Samantha and Patricia always strive for the best possible care and wellbeing of their dogs."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium? ? After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

In order to understand how this may affect the process, let's first consider the role of plants in the ingredients and production of a cake. Plants play a crucial part in a cake's ingredients, such as the production of flour (typically derived from wheat, a plant), sugars (derived from sugar beets or sugarcane, also plants) and even some of the fats involved (such as vegetable oil, derived from plant sources). Moreover, plants are involved in the process of producing eggs and milk – chicken feed largely consists of plant-derived grains, and cows consume plant-based feed to produce milk – two essential ingredients in many cake recipes. Now, when more plants die, it can potentially lead to a shortage of certain ingredients that play important roles in the cake-making process: 1. The shortage of plant-derived ingredients: A reduced availability of flour, sugar, and vegetable oil due to the death of plants will affect the production of cakes. Since these are essential ingredients in most cake recipes, their scarcity would make it more difficult and potentially more expensive to acquire the necessary supplies. 2. Reduced supply of animal-derived ingredients: If plants die off in large numbers, the production of plant-based animal feeds may also diminish. Consequently, the egg and milk industries might face supply chain challenges, making it more difficult to source eggs and milk for cake-making purposes. Although the death of plants will not directly impact a specific step in the cake-making process, it will indirectly impact the availability of ingredients required. Therefore, the perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process, as the effect on essential cake ingredients can make it more challenging to produce a smaller cake."},{"question":"Das Beste, auf das man hoffen kann, ist also vielleicht ein Experiment im russischen Stil, bei dem die Liberalisierung schnell von der nervösen alten Garde des Regimes abgeblasen wird.

It's long in the back, almost to his shoulders, and he thinks that the cars that pass him on the street, the occupants of those cars, might look at him and see only that he is wet and not that he is dirty as well.

Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island had more animals that survived their environment? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine which island had more animals that survived their environment. We are only told that Loon Island had a stable environment and less diverse species, while Wolf Island showed evidence of natural selection and had a large variety of species. However, we can infer that Wolf Island may have had a more competitive environment due to the presence of a large variety of species and evidence of natural selection. This suggests that the animals on Wolf Island had to constantly adapt to survive in their environment, while Loon Island's stable environment might have led to less competition and pressure for change among its inhabitants. But, without further information about the number of animals and their survival rates on each island, we cannot determine which island had more animals that survived their environment."},{"question":"The Nation - The Nation is the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the United States a successor to William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator.

He was sent to prison, where he committed suicide. Samantha Finley (Erin Marie Hogan), her older brother Thomas (Shane Van Dyke), and their mother Ellen (Fia Perera) believe that Ellen has been making contact with her deceased husband, David. Soon the family claims that a demon is haunting them. At first, they think it is David, but after a series of horrible attacks on Samantha, they suspect otherwise. One night the camera records Ellen sitting up in bed and leaving her bedroom. She walks into the living room, where she writes something on a piece of paper. She then crumples the paper and walks back down the hallway. Thomas finds the paper under Samantha's pillow and sees that it spells out the word \\"MARON\\".

What type of punishment might be be worried about? A. train B. hatred C. get angry D. going to jail E. public outrage The best answer is The answer is:","response":"D. going to jail and E. public outrage. Joe did something very bad, and as a result, he might face punishment from The People, which can lead to various types of consequences. Upon detailed examination, there are two valid answers to the question. D. Going to jail: If Joe committed a crime, it is most likely that he would be afraid of facing legal consequences, such as going to jail. This option is a strong possible punishment Joe might worry about as it directly pertains to his actions and carries a severe consequence. Jail not only results in loss of freedom but can also lead to long-lasting social and economic consequences. E. Public outrage: Since the question mentions \\"The People,\\" an essential aspect of punishment to consider is public opinion and response. The public may develop strong negative feelings towards Joe for his actions, leading to widespread criticism and social ostracism. This could result in Joe facing difficulties in securing employment, maintaining relationships, and enjoying a normal social life. Public outrage is an indirect consequence that Joe might be worried about as a result of his wrongdoing. While the other options might seem relevant, they do not directly relate to the question's context as potential punishments for Joe's actions. A. Train: This option does not make sense as a punishment connected to Joe's situation. A train could be an object, a mode of transportation, or even a verb (to train for something). In any case, it does not fit the context of potential punishment for doing something bad. B. Hatred: While hatred could develop as an emotion felt towards Joe, it is not a direct punishment that Joe might face from The People. Hatred can be a part of public outrage, but it does not explicitly represent a consequence for Joe's wrongdoing. C. Get angry: People might indeed get angry with Joe for his actions, but this option does not describe a specific consequence or punishment. Anger is also an emotion that is often closely associated with public outrage, making it an indirect result in Joe's situation. In conclusion, the best answers for the question would be D. going to jail and E. public outrage, as these consequences directly address the potential repercussions Joe might face as a result of his transgression and provide a detailed understanding of the possible punishments."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

How to deal with life being unfair Get to the root of the problem. In order to deal with life being unfair, you first must get to the core of the bad apple you've been tossed. Ask yourself what, exactly, is the root cause of this particular unfairness. OPTIONS: A). For example, suppose the other person reports that people are always doing what you would do if you were in their shoes. And the reason why is that people who weren't living up to your standards were always doing their dirty work.; B). For example, if someone is in your friends place because they think your place is being taken advantage of, then they are being unfair. Maybe they are feeling unfairly treated because they know your pride is in jeopardy, and if so, why? But it doesn't often affect how someone treats you.; C). Sometimes the cause will be something within your control, such as getting into a car accident because you were texting and driving. Other times the root cause is completely out of your control, such as being sexually assaulted or diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition.; D).

Sometimes the cause will be something within your control, such as getting into a car accident because you were texting and driving. Other times the root cause is completely out of your control, such as being sexually assaulted or diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition. Explanation: Answer A is incorrect because it seems fragmented and doesn't provide a clear example of how to deal with life being unfair. It mentions people reporting that others are doing what you would do if in their shoes, without explaining what that has to do with unfairness. Answer B is incorrect because it focuses on a specific situation (someone taking your friend's place because they think your place is being taken advantage of) rather than providing a general example of dealing with life being unfair. It also doesn't explain how it affects the person feeling unfairly treated. Answer D is incorrect because it only presents an example of a specific situation (a taxi driver who never hits the curb being late for a pickup), rather than addressing the broader concept of dealing with life being unfair and getting to the root cause of the problem. Answer C is the correct answer because it provides two different examples of dealing with life being unfair—one where the root cause is within your control, and one where it is not. This helps to illustrate the importance of getting to the root cause of the problem and understanding that not all situations can be controlled."},{"question":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The answer is:","response":"As an AI, I don't possess personal opinions, but I will provide a thoughtful analysis to support an answer for you. When it comes to the question \\"which gender is more likely to cause harm or pain during the mating season?\\", we must consider the context in which the question is asked. Are we referring to harm or pain in humans or animals? If we're discussing animals, certain animal species have males that are known to cause harm to females during mating, such as the male bedbug that punctures the female's body to deposit sperm. However, it's important to note that not all mating behaviors are harmful and depending on the species, both males and females may exhibit different mating patterns. If the question pertains to humans, it's important that we avoid making sweeping generalizations about behaviors based on gender. While there may be some data to suggest different tendencies for males and females during mating or courtship interactions, there is a wide variation in human behavior and tying it down to a single generalization is not accurate or fair. Given that males have the potential to cause harm or pain and keeping in mind the context and species, the answer would not be \\"non-binary\\", as the focus in the question is males, regardless of whether they are binary or non-binary males. However, it's crucial to remember that making generalizations based on gender disregards individual differences and can lead to harmful stereotypes. A more appropriate answer could be: \\"It depends on the context and species being discussed.\\" This answer avoids making sweeping generalizations while acknowledging that harm or pain during the mating season can occur, depending on various factors."},{"question":"Possible answers: *Yes *No Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what usually has a shell?\\" is \\"humans\\", given that most oysters have shells?

He discusses the history behind each of the councils, including the theological conflicts leading to them. He details the statements of each of the councils and explains the meaning in simple language. He highlights the heresies combated by the councils and goes into some detail regarding the theological issues behind the conflicts. This book is an excellent resource for study of the Trinity and the nature of Jesus as fully God and fully man. The seventh council deals with icons, and Toon offers a well-written account of the conflict relating to icons in the church. This book is highly recommended as offering clear examples of what is orthodox Christianity regarding views of the Trinity especially. It is very relevant in today's church. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","response":"This review depicts the product in a flattering light. The reviewer highlights the clarity and ease with which the author presents complex theological concepts. They also emphasize the usefulness of the book in studying the Trinity, the nature of Jesus, and orthodox Christianity.

But the website I logged on was Sohu -- one of the China's biggest online video services -- that purchased exclusive rights to the series for mainland China, and posted the latest season at the same time as Netflix. Glued to my laptop, I couldn't help but notice the major role China plays this season as one riveting plot unfolds after another. If you have been reading news headlines out of China, you would find any of the China angles familiar and believable: suspected cyber espionage, a trade war with Washington, a territorial dispute with Japan -- complete with an utterly corrupt Communist Party insider who boasts direct access to the decision-making Standing Committee. Censors. All this \\"realness\\" makes it a little surreal that my binge-viewing of the U.S. TV series happened in China. This, after all, is a country where the government allows only 34 foreign films to be screened in cinemas every year, and propaganda authorities routinely censor China-related material from foreign sources that they deem politically sensitive or merely unflattering. Case in point: \\"The Blacklist,\\" a new American crime drama, is widely available on Chinese video sites -- except Episode 3. That episode has been removed by all streaming services -- including Sohu -- because it features a Chinese spy who kills CIA operatives as its main villain, and critiques China's controversial one-child family planning policy. The China subplots in \\"House of Cards,\\" Season 2 don't exactly portray the country all that positively, but the government appears to be leaving Sohu alone. \\"We didn't know the second season would have so much to do with China -- probably because of the increasing importance of China in global affairs,\\" Charles Zhang, Sohu's chief executive, told me at a press conference Tuesday. \\"Many Chinese people -- including officials -- are watching it now and we have had no problem.\\" \\"So (the American shows on your site) are not subject to censorship?\\" I asked. \\"So far, no,\\" he replied. Hands off. Some analysts are surprised by the government's largely hands-off approach to video streaming sites, but caution that it may not last. \\"New media is allowed to develop with less interference than older forms where there is already a structure in place,\\" said Jeremy Goldkorn, a long-time Beijing-based observer and commentator on Chinese media. \\"It's going to be regulated just like any other media, especially if it becomes big enough, powerful enough and popular enough.\\" For now, Sohu is focusing on broadening the appeal of \\"House of Cards,\\" scrambling to add Chinese subtitles and bombarding visitors to its website with banner ads. Sohu users have clearly noticed. The series' latest and original seasons now occupy the top two spots in Sohu's chart of most-watched American TV shows. Season 2 has been clocking almost three million views a day -- impressive for a complex story that requires a deep understanding of U.S. politics. Gripping plots. In comments left online, many Chinese viewers indicated they are drawn to the show for the same reasons as fans elsewhere: gripping plot twists, superb acting and stark parallel to reality. \\"If you have to see the show as social commentary, I think it's a strong diatribe against the political system in the U.S. rather than against China,\\" said Raymond Zhou, a well-known columnist for China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper. \\"The narrative doesn't fault China but rather just one individual from China.\\" A widely circulated Internet post claims that China's anti-corruption tsar -- one of the seven Politburo Standing Committee members who effectively rule the country -- is a loyal fan of \\"House of Cards\\" and has recommended it to other officials. The anecdote may not be as far-fetched as one might think, considering what the show's Machiavellian protagonist Frank Underwood tells viewers while being sworn in as the U.S. vice president: \\"One heartbeat away from the presidency and not a single vote cast in my name -- democracy is so overrated.\\" With messages like that, \\"House of Cards\\" seems to be a show China's Communist leaders don't mind their citizens watching at all. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"The article discusses the popularity of the American political drama \\"House of Cards\\" in China, noting that the second season was streamed on one of China's largest online video services, Sohu. It also delves into the portrayal of China in the series, including themes such as cyber-espionage, trade wars, territorial disputes, and corrupt officials. Despite the content, the Chinese government has not intervened or censored the show, allowing Sohu to broadcast it. Analysts speculate that this may be due to Sohu being a new media platform that has not yet drawn the attention of government regulators. The show's popularity in China is also attributed to its gripping plot twists, superb acting, and realistic themes."},{"question":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony? is inside the article: Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \\"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics., can you guess it ?

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Bad News Bears Movie plot: Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a washed-up alcoholic baseball player who was a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners before getting kicked out of professional baseball for attacking an umpire. He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7. After the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of trying, knowing that winning is not so important. My question: What did The Bears do at the end of the movie? Answer:","response":"At the end of the movie, the Bears may not have won the championship, losing 8-7, but they still celebrated their journey and efforts. Coach Buttermaker gave the team non-alcoholic beer, and they proceeded to spray it all over each other in a jovial, celebratory manner. Despite not winning the championship, they found satisfaction in their personal growth and the realization that winning isn't the most important thing."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution.

Emmet Walsh as various images of the Texas landscape are shown. The film then shifts to a conversation between Abby (Frances McDormand) and Ray (John Getz) in a car as it drives through a heavy downpour at night. They seem to be discussing Abby's bad marriage and Ray indicates that he's driving her to Houston. But instead of driving Abby to Houston, Ray drives to a motel and they have sex. We later find out that Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns a Texas bar, has suspected Abby's affair with Ray, one of his bartenders, so he hires private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to take photos of them. When Visser reports back to Marty, he teases him about being cuckolded. The morning after their tryst, Marty makes a silent phone call to Ray and Abby. The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee. Visser then shoots Marty with Abby's gun in a double cross, leaving her gun at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty. But he accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter and does not realize that Marty has stolen one of the incriminating photographs and locked it in the safe. Ray returns to the bar to get his last paycheck and accidentally kicks Abby's gun, firing it. He finds a motionless Marty and decides to cover up the murder. He cleans up the blood and disposes of evidence in a backyard...

And the answer is...","response":"To solve the equation -44g - 137g + 7674 - 30699 = 126g for g, first combine the like terms involving g on the left side of the equation. Step 1: (-44g - 137g) + 7674 - 30699 = 126g Combine the terms: -181g + 7674 - 30699 = 126g Now, add 30699 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side. Step 2: -181g + 7674 - 30699 + 30699 = 126g + 30699 Simplify: -181g + 7674 = 126g + 30699 Next, add 181g to both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving g on the right side. Step 3: -181g + 7674 + 181g = 126g + 30699 + 181g Simplify: 7674 = 307g + 30699 Now, subtract 30699 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving g on the right side. Step 4: 7674 - 30699 = 307g + 30699 - 30699 Simplify: -23025 = 307g Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 307 to solve for g. Step 5: -23025 / 307 = 307g / 307 Simplify: g ≈ -75 So, the solution to the equation -44g - 137g + 7674 - 30699 = 126g is g ≈ -75."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: usually the roots were gathered underwater from the shoals of the island by the women of the tribe.","response":"Step 1: Identify the beginning of the sentence. - The first word \\"usually\\" is the beginning of the sentence.

Step 1: Understand DNA replication as the process of copying genetic material in a parent DNA strand. Step 2: Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and play a crucial role in the replication process. Step 3: In the context of DNA replication, new nucleotides are derived from free-floating nucleotide triphosphates within the cell. Step 4: These nucleotide triphosphates are attracted to their complementary base pairs in the parent DNA strand under the direction of enzymes, particularly DNA polymerase.

In the case of the provided review \\"Consumes lot of memory Consumes lot of memory. Process also eat ram.\\", I will analyze these factors and provide a rating based on those elements: 1. Completeness: The review mainly focuses on the high memory and RAM consumption of the product or software. However, it does not provide any additional information on other aspects such as performance, user-friendliness, or features which are also important when assessing a product. Additionally, it doesn't mention what product or software the review is referring to, so it's difficult to gauge its relevance. 2. Relevancy: While the memory and RAM consumption are important considerations, the review doesn't provide context for potential users. It is unclear whether the reviewer is evaluating the product for a specific type of device or system that might have limited resources, or if this is a widespread issue affecting all its users. Therefore, the relevancy of this review to other users remains uncertain. 3. Objectivity: The review seems to be a statement of the memory and RAM consumption from the user's perspective, but it does not explain if other users encountered the same issues. Moreover, there is a lack of comparative data or analysis that would allow readers to determine how these factors perform relative to other products in the market. This prevents the review from being entirely objective. 4. Specificity: Although the reviewer mentions memory and RAM consumption, there is a lack of specific details or data to support their claims. For instance, information regarding how much memory and RAM is being consumed compared to what would be normally expected for a similar product would have been useful. The presence of quantitative data, comparisons, or examples would enhance the review's validity. Taking all these factors into consideration, I would rate this review a 2 out of 5. This rating acknowledges that memory and RAM consumption are relevant concerns for some users. However, the review falls short in providing a comprehensive, relevant, objective, and specific evaluation of the product. A higher rating would require additional information and a more balanced assessment to be of greater value to potential users."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Compared to an undeveloped patch of Yellowstone national park, would the city of Detroit, which is a highly developed industrial city, consume fewer natural resources? or more natural resources? A:","response":"The city of Detroit, which is a highly developed industrial city, would consume more natural resources. Justification: The passage mentions that the demand on natural resources increases as countries develop and build more factories. Detroit, being a highly developed industrial city, would therefore require a larger amount of resources for its established industries and development. Conversely, an undeveloped patch of Yellowstone National Park, which doesn't have such industries, wouldn't have the same resource demands. So, in comparison, Detroit would consume more natural resources."},{"question":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Animals are a favorite subject of many photographers. Cats, dogs, and other pets top the list, followed by zoo animals. However, because it's hard to get them to sit still and \\"perform on command,\\" some professional photographers refuse to photograph pets. One way to get an appealing portrait of a cat or dog is to hold a biscuit or treat above the camera. The animal's longing look toward the food will be captured by the camera, but the treat won't appear in the picture because it's out of the camera's range. When you show the picture to your friends afterwards, they'll be impressed by your pet's loving expression. If you are using fast film, you can take some good, quick shots of a pet by simply snapping a picture right after calling its name. You'll get a different expression from your pet using this technique. Depending on your pet's mood, the picture will capture an interested, curious expression or possibly a look of annoyance, especially if you've awakened it from a nap. Taking pictures of zoo animals requires a little more patience. After all, you can't wake up a lion! You may have to wait for a while until the animal does something interesting or moves into a position for you to get a good shot. When photographing zoo animals, don't get too close to the cages, and never tap on the glass or throw things between the bars of a cage. Concentrate on shooting some good pictures, and always respect the animals you are photographing. The answer is:","response":"What is one way to capture an appealing portrait of a cat or dog? A.

Futurists are scientists who analyze the way the world is today and use that information.to predict what the world will be like in the future. Golden focuses on the study of transportation. He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But he's most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the future. Many public transportation supporters dislike big cities because they spend hours driving from one side of the city to the other. And there aren't enough buses and. subways. However, Golden sees a trend toward fewer cars' in the future. He explains, \\"Cities have a cost of car ownership, which is a challenge. All these vehicles cost the city in services, in having to repair roads and other things. \\"Cars also take up a lot of space. Golden points out that having so many parking spaces is wasteful. Much of the time the parking spaces sit empty. What is the solution?\\"I think cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have ,\\" says Golden. \\"Instead, people will use taxis, subways, and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better. Imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal when they wanted to ride the bus.

A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem. Less simple chronographs use additional complications and can have multiple independent hands to measure seconds, minutes, hours and even tenths of a second. In addition, many modern chronographs use moveable bezels as tachymeters for rapid calculations of speed or distance. Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 for use in tracking astronomical objects. Chronographs were also used heavily in artillery fire in the mid to late 1800s. More modern uses of chronographs involve piloting airplanes, car racing, diving and submarine maneuvering. - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014.

While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Louis Moinet (1768 - 1853), inventor of the chronograph, was born into a prosperous family of farmers in Bourges, France, was a French horologist, sculptor and painter. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

Don’t put a lock through the tags on your zippers since they can easily be broken off. If you plan on traveling with your backpack through busy areas, invest in locks so no one can steal your belongings. If you’re taking your bag through an airport, make sure you use a lock that’s TSA-approved. Backpacks that have a basic color, such as black or brown, are easier for thieves to steal since they don’t have any distinguishing features. Look for backpacks that have reflective strips or bright colors so you can identify it as your own and stay safe while you travel. If your bag doesn’t have any built-in colors, use ribbons or neon duct tape on parts of your bag so you can see it from a distance. Keep in mind how you’re primarily using the backpack to determine what sort of storage you need. For example, you may want separate sections for dirty and clean clothes or a laptop sleeve to hold protect your valuables. Compressions straps are buckles used to hold your materials tightly so they don’t take up as much space. When you pack your bag, use the compression straps to hold down soft items, such as clothes. Tighten the straps to condense your things so you can put more on top. If your bag doesn’t have compression straps, then you can also buy compression cubes to put in your bag instead. Some larger travel backpacks have smaller packs attached that you can remove. That way, you don’t need to carry all of your belongings everywhere you go. Instead, you can leave your larger bag where you’re staying and travel light during the day. Not every travel backpack will have a removable day pack.

This romantic comedy film is a reimagination of the original 1987 movie with the same name. The original film, directed by Garry Marshall, starred Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, while the 2018 version was directed by Rob Greenberg and featured Anna Faris, Eugenio Derbez, and Eva Longoria in the lead roles. In the 1987 version, the story revolves around a wealthy, spoiled woman (Hawn) who accidentally falls off her yacht, loses her memory, and is then taken in by a carpenter (Russell) who convinces her that she is his wife and the mother of his four children. The comedy in the film comes from the unexpected dynamic the characters experience as they adapt to their new roles. The 2018 remake puts a modern twist on the original by reversing the gender roles. In the updated story, the over-privileged character who loses their memory is now portrayed by Eugenio Derbez, a wealthy, selfish Mexican playboy. Anna Faris plays a working-class single mom who tricks him into believing they are married so that she can get revenge on him for mistreating her in the past. The revised film aims to provide a fresh take on the original story while maintaining the essence of the romantic comedy genre. Although it received mixed reviews from critics, the movie did well at the box office, demonstrating the lasting appeal and charm of the original \\"Overboard\\" concept."},{"question":"Article: My my, the past year has been a huge one for body diversity. From getting more attention to in-between sized models to a size 22 body acceptance activist landing a major modeling contract, the fashion industry has finally started taking note that non-straight size women are actual customers, too. Even men’s magazines are listening up, with Sports Illustrated putting an ad featuring a plus size model in its Swimsuit edition–and now, the magazine has actually put a plus size model into a feature. Naturally, it is Robyn Lawley, one of the most popular models (plus size or not) of our time. The Australian 25-year-old was picked as one of SI‘s 2015 Rookies, though she is already a very experienced model with her own swimsuit line. Plus, she’s represented by world-famous agency Wilhelmina Models, one of the top management agencies in the business. The magazine revealed her sexy python-print bikini shot along with a quick blurb about her many talents, including writing, painting, and DJing. You know what is notably missing? Talking about her size. Thank goodness that SI didn’t pat themselves on the back or make some bullshit condescending “real woman” category. Nope! Just put her up as another hot model. High five, SI, you did this the right way. It makes tons of sense that Robyn was chosen for a magazine like Sports Illustrated given her incredibly good looks and already-strong presence in men’s magazines. Like Calvin Klein‘s breakout star Myla Dalbesio, Robyn is a size 10, which technically puts her under the typical line for “plus size,” but in the fashion world, size 10 is basically light years away from the traditional model.

From a profoundly young age, females are taught that there is a very specific type of beauty that exists, and that anything outside of that is either niche or unacceptable. And while I am not stoked on the objectification that the Swimsuit Issue represents, to a certain extent, I am stoked that there is an increase in body diversity both in women’s publications and men’s, meaning everybody will be exposed to more types of figures, sizes, and shapes.

(Diane Bondareff/Invision for Barbie/AP) This year’s Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue will look slightly different from the rest — at least on one page. Instead of a beautiful model in an exotic location showing off her assets in a skimpy bikini, this page will feature a beautiful plus-sized model in an exotic location showing off her assets in a skimpy bikini. Okay, so the publication, which comes out Monday, won’t be that much different, especially considering the plus-sized inclusion is a paid advertisement opposed to an editorial decision, but hey, small steps lead to big steps sometimes. “I know my curves are sexy and I want everyone else to know that theirs are too,” 27-year-old model Ashley Graham said in a statement (via US Weekly) about her campaign for swimwear seller SwimsuitsForAll.com. “There is no reason to hide and every reason to flaunt.” The ad is part of SwimsuitsForAll.com’s larger #CurvesinBikinis campaign, which is meant to give young women a healthier view of their bodies. “Tastes and body types change over time and curves have never been more ‘in.’ There is no better way to celebrate and show off than by donning a bikini,” said the company’s CEO and President Moshe Laniado (via US Weekly). Laniado is right. The famously curvy Kate Upton snagged the past two issues’ covers, which may pave the way for more variation in body types featured in the editorial portions of the magazine in years to come. Upton, of course, is not “plus-sized,” but her size 8 dress size is larger than, say, that of model Carolyn Murphy, who showed off her size 4 frame on the issue’s cover 10 years ago. It was in 2005, as well, when the true money-making potential of the Swimsuit Issue reached new heights. Murphy’s issue generated upwards of 35 million in ad sales, according to Forbes, cementing the perennial publication as one of Time Inc.’s biggest revenue drivers going forward. Today, Forbes says the issue drive 1 billion in revenue. |||||Summary:","response":"In the past year, there has been a lot of progress in the fashion industry regarding body diversity. More attention has been given to different sized models, and a size 22 body acceptance activist landed a major modeling contract. Sports Illustrated has put an ad featuring a plus size model in its Swimsuit edition and now has a plus size model in a feature. This is a big deal because from a young age, girls are taught that there is a specific type of beauty, and anything outside of that is not acceptable. So, having an increase in body diversity in both women's and men's publications exposes everyone to more types of body shapes and sizes, making people more accepting of different looks."},{"question":"Answer the following question: - weight lbs is 245 - position is guard - height in is 3 - cfldraftedyear is 1976 - cfldraftedround is 2 - college is ottawa - cflwestallstar is 1979 - playing years is 1976 - 1985 - imagewidth is 150 - height ft is 6 - birth date is 29 april 1953 - cfldraftedteam is edmonton eskimos - playing team is edmonton eskimos - cfldraftedpick is 18 - birth place is ottawa , ontario - import is no Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Christian Gysin. PUBLISHED:. 17:24 EST, 12 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 02:24 EST, 13 September 2013. Excluded: Sian Lloyd, with Jonathan Ashman on their 2007 wedding day. Sian Lloyd was said to be devastated last night after being ‘uninvited’ from the wedding of her stepdaughter Suzanne Ashman to Euan Blair, son of the former prime minister. TV weathergirl Miss Lloyd married Suzanne’s father, 64-year-old motor racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman, after a whirlwind romance six years ago and had been preparing to attend tomorrow’s ceremony for weeks. But just days ago she was told that she would not be welcome at the Blair family mansion in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire, where the wedding party is due to take place. ‘She was basically and unceremoniously uninvited,’ explained a close friend last night. ‘Sian is devastated and at one stage Jonathan was talking about not going if Sian was not allowed to attend. 'But Sian has insisted he attend as he is giving his only child away and simply must be there. ‘The mystery remains for Sian as to why she has been excluded. She has been met with a wall of silence from both Suzanne and the Blair side so she just has to accept what she has been told.’ It is not known if Miss Ashman herself decided that Miss Lloyd, 55, should not attend the wedding – or if she has been excluded for anything she might have said publicly or privately about the Blair family in the past. ‘All she knows,’ added a friend, ‘is that she has got an embossed wedding invitation with her name on it and now she will not be going – and she is none the wiser why.’ Mr Ashman’s 25-year-old daughter Suzanne is from his marriage to first wife Sedef, which ended more than 13 years ago. She is the daughter of a former Turkish government minister and one-time mayor of Ankara. Euan Blair, 29, who has been dating Suzanne for eight years, is due to marry her at South Pavilion, the Buckinghamshire mansion that his parents bought for £4million in 2008. The young couple were introduced by former defence secretary Geoff Hoon. In recent weeks it has been suggested the Blairs – who are estimated to be worth more than £60 million – are planning a stunning wedding and reception for the couple who became engaged last Christmas and have bought a house together in Islington, North London. Miss Ashman read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Trinity College, Oxford, after leaving the private St Paul’s Girls’ School in south-west London. Last minute preparations: Euan Blair and Suzanne Ashman on a night out in London 2009 are now looking forward to their big day. Wedding: Tony and Cherie Blair's son Euan is marrying Suzanne Ashman and the party afterwards is taking place at the family mansion in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire. She carried out work experience with Mr Hoon during which she met Euan Blair. She later worked at Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation. Last year, after working for American merchant bank Morgan Stanley, Euan became a business development manager at the Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access – part of the Government’s Work Programme – in a move said by some to be a stepping stone towards following his father into politics. Euan is the eldest of the Blairs’ four children and he is the first to marry, though it is unclear whether it will be a Roman Catholic service. He was brought up a Catholic and attended the popular Catholic Oratory school in West London before going to Bristol University where he obtained a 2:1 in History. The Blair mansion: South Pavilion, in Wotton Underwood, where the wedding party will take place. Cherie Blair is a Catholic and her husband joined the Catholic Church in 2007. Guests who are expected at the wedding include Cherie Blair’s Muslim convert sister Lauren but her father, actor Tony Booth, may not be well enough to attend. Miss Lloyd met Jonathan Ashman at a St David’s Day party at Westminster Palace hosted by then Secretary of State for Wales Peter Hain in 2007. Mr Ashman proposed to her in December that year at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania while they were on holiday and the pair married just weeks later at the Portmeirion Hotel in Gwynedd, Wales. Last night Miss Lloyd was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Tony Blair did not wish to comment.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What proposition is Milk trying to defeat? Movie title: Milk Movie plot: As the opening credits roll, old black and white newsreel footage from what looks like the 50s and early 60s flashes by of men being rounded up (and roughed up) by the police. Newspaper headlines break up the footage, announcing police raids of gay bars: \\"Crackdown of Homosexual Bars\\", \\"Men Charged in Taverns\\", etc. The men are all very well-dressed, clean-cut, and incredibly embarrassed, holding their hands over their faces, some with their suit coats over their heads. They are loaded up into paddy wagons as police push and shove them, snickering. Some of the men sit in large rooms, awaiting questioning and photographic, looking like their whole lives have just been destroyed.The narration of this film is carried out by Harvey Milk speaking into a tape recorded in 1978, dictating a letter to be read (or in this case, listened to) only in the event of his assassination. As he narrates, we catch glimpses of Milk in front of various groups, giving speeches, using attention-getting opening lines that vary with every crowd. In front of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) crowds, he opens with \\"My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.\\" In front of burly straight union workers, he opts for, \\"My name is Harvey Milk, and sorry I am not what you expected, but I left my high heels at home\\".In narration, Milk explains gay activists are targets for being so visible. There's a sudden newsreel clip of what looks like actual footage of a very young Diane Fienstein making the announcement both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated (NOTE: for the unaware, that's California's current Senator Diane Fienstein, who in 1978 was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who became Mayor upon Moscone's assassination, and later, of course, United States Senator).Milk, narrating his \\"Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter\\" frames the rest of the movie, taking the audience to important points chronologically, beginning in 1970 New York.Milk, dapper in a very Sears & Roebuck 70s gray suit... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Milk,\\" the main proposition Harvey Milk is trying to defeat is Proposition 6, also known as the Briggs Initiative. The Briggs Initiative was a proposed ballot initiative in California in 1978 that aimed to ban gay and lesbian individuals from working in public schools. The initiative would have allowed for the firing of public school employees if they were discovered to be gay, lesbian, or supportive of gay rights. Proposition 6 was seen as a major threat to the civil rights of the LGBTQ+ community, and Harvey Milk, who was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in California, led the efforts to oppose and defeat the discriminatory proposition. Mobilizing both the LGBTQ+ community and their straight allies, Milk used his platform to raise awareness about the facts surrounding Proposition 6, challenge the misinformation spread by its supporters, and encourage the public to vote against it. The movie follows Milk's journey from his early years in New York City as a closeted gay man to his rise as a prominent LGBTQ+ rights activist in San Francisco. In the film, we witness Milk's increasing involvement in the gay rights movement, his political career, and his personal relationships. Through these events, the film highlights the immense challenges and societal prejudices the LGBTQ+ community faced in the fight for equality and acceptance during the 1970s. The movie culminates with the campaigns for and against Proposition 6, showcasing Milk's tireless efforts in organizing and advocating against the initiative. Ultimately, Milk's hard work, along with the support from various groups and individuals, result in the defeat of Proposition 6, which marked a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights in California and served as an inspiration to the broader gay rights movement. \\"Milk\\" serves as a powerful depiction of Harvey Milk's life, his fight for equal rights, and his dedication to defeating harmful and discriminatory legislation such as Proposition 6. By providing an in-depth exploration of Milk's life, activism, and achievements, the movie can be an essential resource for understanding the importance of LGBTQ+ history and the strength of community organizing in creating social change. As you consider whether to invest in this film proposal, it is crucial to remember the cultural and historical significance of Harvey Milk's story and the impact of the film on raising awareness for LGBTQ+ rights and history."},{"question":"If \\"An old asian man wearing a red beanie and blue jacket is smiling.\\" does that mean that \\"Asian man smiling to see his daughter.\\"?

Statue: A statue is a three-dimensional sculpture typically created as an artistic representation of a person, animal, or object. In this sentence, the statue is the main subject being described. Thus, it holds great importance in understanding the focus of the sentence. 2. Philosopher: A philosopher is an individual who engages in critical thinking, seeking truth and wisdom through the study of fundamental problems concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. In this sentence, the philosopher denotes who the statue represents, adding a critical piece of information that helps us know the specific subject of the sculpture. 3. Outside: This term indicates location, illustrating a relationship between the statue and its surroundings. It tells us that the statue is positioned outdoors, rather than indoors or within a specific space, such as a museum or gallery. This word also suggests that the statue is likely of a significant size and possibly meant to be prominently displayed. 4. Palladian: Palladian architecture is a European architectural style derived from the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). This style is characterized by a strict adherence to classical principles inspired by ancient Roman temples, resulting in symmetrical, harmonious, and elegant buildings. The inclusion of the term 'Palladian' in the sentence offers critical information about the architectural context in which the statue appears. This word helps establish a cultural and historical context that can add to our understanding and appreciation of the statue and its surroundings. 5. Structure: In this context, the structure refers to an architectural-building or edifice that follows the Palladian architectural style. The presence of the statue outside of this structure implies a connection between the philosopher, the statue, and the building, such as the values they embody or their contextual importance in a historical or cultural setting. To summarize, the most important words in the sentence are \\"statue,\\" \\"philosopher,\\" \\"outside,\\" \\"Palladian,\\" and \\"structure.\\" These words together create a vivid image of the setting and establish a historical, cultural, and architectural context. Each term adds to our understanding of the subject and the intellectual and artistic significance of the statue and its location."},{"question":"On May 20, 1971, his brother, Meinhard, died in a car accident. Meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was due to marry Erika Knapp, and the couple had a three-year-old son, Patrick.

Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

The answer is:","response":"1. Water Ice: Researchers have discovered signs of water ice in many parts of Mars. In fact, there is enough ice just beneath the planet's surface to fill Lake Superior, the world's largest freshwater lake by volume. These ice reserves are found beneath the surface at Mars' middle to high latitudes. Detecting water is significant as it is a key ingredient for life, and could potentially be used as a resource by future human explorers. 2. Evidence of Ancient Lakes and Streams: NASA's rovers, like the Curiosity Rover, have discovered that there were once potentially habitable environments on Mars. It found evidence of ancient fast flowing streams and lakes. 3. Seasonal Methane: Methane (CH4) is an organic molecule present on Mars. Curiosity rover confirmed the presence of methane on Mars in 2014 and fluctuations in its levels depending on the season. This is intriguing because on Earth, methane is produced by both geological and biological processes. 4. Organic Molecules: In 2018, Curiosity Rover discovered complex organic molecules in Martian rocks. These are the same type of molecules that might be the product of life. 5. Martian Meteorites: Over 200 Mars meteorites have been found on Earth. These meteorites have helped scientists understand the Martian crust and mantle composition, as well as the age of Martian surfaces. 6. Current Weather and Climate: Mars has seasons like Earth, but they are about twice as long because Mars’ year is about 1.9 Earth years. Temperature, pressure, and radiation measurements have been taken by several Mars landers and rovers. 7. Volcanic Activity: Mars has the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and it has evidence of volcanic activity. Though it's currently a dormant volcano, this shows Mars was geologically active in the past. 8. Dust Storms: Mars experiences massive dust storms, the largest in our solar system. These storms can cover the entire planet and last for months. 9. Polar Ice Caps: Just like Earth, Mars has polar ice caps made from water and carbon dioxide. These ice caps also change with the Martian seasons. 10. Possibility of Past Life: While the presence of extraterrestrial life has not been detected, several Mars missions have been launched specifically designed to search for biosignatures (signs of past or present life). For example, Perseverance rover is currently in its mission intending to explore previous life conditions. The steps I took to gather these facts include researching through various Mars exploration projects, looking at factual data, and analyzing discoveries made over time.

The government has said higher fees will be linked to teaching quality - but plans released on Thursday suggest that all three quality bands can apply the same increase. This will include those \\"significantly below benchmark in one or more areas\\". The government has already announced an increase to £9,250 for autumn 2017 - if the Houses of Parliament approve plans to lift the current cap of £9,000. The Department for Education says the fee increases for 2018 will be a second \\"trial year\\" before a system with different levels of fees based on teaching quality. \\"Universities will not be able to increase their fees unless they pass rigorous quality standards,\\" said a Department for Education spokeswoman. \\"We have always been clear that as the framework develops it will become increasingly robust, with additional criteria, such as university's retention and graduate employment rates, introduced into the judging process.\\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said a further rise in fees was \\"unacceptable\\" and asked: \\"Where does it end?\\". The process for deciding quality will be the \\"teaching excellence framework\\" - and for the first year, while it is being set up, the government has allowed an across-the-board increase to £9,250 from autumn 2017. The Department for Education has now published plans for how it will be implemented - and universities will be classified in three grades - gold, silver and bronze. But the proposals say that for courses starting in autumn 2018, \\"all those achieving a rating of bronze, silver and gold will receive the full inflationary uplift\\". The forecast for inflation for 2018-19 from the Office for Budget Responsibility is 3.2% - which would push the cost of fees above £9,500. The specifications for bronze standard says these universities will be of \\"satisfactory quality\\" but they are \\"likely to be significantly below benchmark in one or more areas\\". It says students at these universities will be \\"occasionally engaged with developments from the forefront of research, scholarship or practice, and are occasionally involved in these activities\\". But the universities in this quality range - which will be decided next year - will be able to charge the same basic tuition fee in 2018 as those in the higher quality bands. Beyond 2018, there could be different levels of fees charged, based on these assessments of quality. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: \\"By setting out clear incentives for universities, the framework will drive up quality in the sector at the same time as improving student choice and crucially, graduate outcomes - so that we can be confident we have the skills employers need now and for the future. \\"The framework will also give students clear, understandable information about where the best teaching is on offer and for the first time, place teaching quality on a par with research at our universities.\\" But Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: \\"Higher education needs to be funded sustainably but for Government to continue to let fees creep up year on year, so students are unable to get a clear picture of the debt they might face, is unacceptable.\\" David Phoenix, chair of the MillionPlus group of new universities, said it would be important for the teaching assessments to \\"take proper account of the diverse range of universities and higher education students\\". But Prof Phoenix said he remained \\"concerned about the timetable for implementation and the link with fees\\". Dame Julia Goodfellow, president of Universities UK, said: \\"Universities have increased investment in teaching and learning following the funding reforms and student satisfaction rates are at record levels.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","response":"The UK government has announced that tuition fees for all universities, regardless of their teaching quality rating, will rise by the rate of inflation (currently 3.2%) to over £9,500 for courses beginning in autumn 2018.

The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found.

Hermitage added T37 100m gold to her 400m title and Davies, already the F42 discus champion, claimed shot put gold. Jonathan Broom-Edwards took silver in the T44 high jump. It takes Britain's total medal tally to 35, surpassing the 31 won in Doha two years ago and closing in on their best modern tally of 38, set in 2011. Paralympic champion Hahn, 20, triumphed in a star-studded final containing three British gold medallists in this event, along with 400m winner Cox and long jump champion Olivia Breen, who came fourth. Hahn, who has cerebral palsy, cemented herself as the classification's premier sprinter, finishing more than half a second ahead of Cox, for her fifth career world title and ninth medal at major competitions. \\"I'm so happy to retain my title and break a world record. It has been amazing, I just want to thank the officials, volunteers and National Lottery, without all of them we wouldn't be here,\\" she told BBC Radio 5 live. Cox, 26, completed a trio of gold, silver and bronze medals in London and said she would now focus on repeating her feat of claiming gold in two separate sports at Rio 2016 by returning to cycling before Tokyo 2020. Davies' gold in the discus on Sunday had come in his less-favoured event, suggesting the 26-year-old's success in the shot put was almost certain, having won the title at the last two Worlds and at Rio 2016. Davies, who was born with talipes and hemi-hemilia, which means his right leg is missing bones, muscle and ligaments, is the first man to pass the 17m mark in the classification, throwing 17.52m to smash his own record of 16.13m. \\"I was happy to say the least - phenomenal,\\" said the Welshman. \\"This crowd got me to a different level and I would thank every single person if I could. \\"What I wanted to do was be at the forefront of the event and the aim is 20m and it is something I think I could do. \\"Discus has been on the back-burner since London as it is not in the Paralympic programme so it has been about the shot put and we think we can go further, we were aiming for 18m.\\" Hermitage, 28, who has cerebral palsy, walked away from athletics at the age of 14 but returned to training five years ago, citing London 2012 as an inspiration. She has gone on to win Paralympic gold in Rio and a world title in Doha, but has spoken of her desire to make memories inside the same stadium that hosted the Paralympics in 2012. She can now reflect on two world titles, including a world record in the 400m. \\"I didn't get the best of starts, I was aware of the pressure on my outside, but it went well and I'm happy to get the win,\\" she said. Earlier, Broom-Edwards, who has muscular and joint impairments in his legs, was beaten by Poland's Maciej Lepiato at a major championships for the fourth time in his career. The 29-year-old now has silver medals from three World Championships as well as last year's Paralympics. \\"I feel great. It's not quite the result I was aiming for. I feel I'm in shape for a new personal best. But this atmosphere is hard to harness,\\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"The atmosphere can help and it can hinder. There was one jump I was so excited and I crashed into the bar. It's an experience I want to get better at.\\" Elsewhere, Graeme Ballard and Paul Blake finished fourth and sixth respectively in the T36 100m and Jack Gladman was ninth in the T38 1500m on his senior international debut. Zak Skinner, making his British debut at a major championships, came fourth in the T13 long jump, for athletes with visual impairment. America's Paralympic champion Mikey Brannigan, the first T20 athlete to run a sub four-minute mile, took gold in the event as GB's Steve Morris came fifth and team-mate James Hamilton sixth. Ireland's Michael McKillop defended his middle-distance double by winning the T37 1500m final to add to his 800m success.

Nevertheless, let the villain have a good, genuine reason for being so mean (e.g. jealousy, alienation, revenge, protection). A laugh is a confirmation of their power, so it has to suit them. Pick it out carefully. You could choose the deep Dracula kind of chuckle for the guys, the high toned witch cackle could suit some females, but not all.

In complex plots, henchmen have their very own personalities and would not be considered as part of the super villain. But if the story is short and simple, a henchman can be limited. Give them a basic good quality - e.g. brains, strength, speed, obedience, bravery - and a basic bad quality - e.g. stupidity, clumsiness, cowardice.

Former Real Madrid manager Mourinho fell out with his compatriot during his time at the Bernabeu. Ronaldo has assured fans the ice pack on his knee after Portugal's defeat by France was purely precautionary. The record-breaking forward left Real Madrid fans with their hearts in their mouths on Saturday when he immediately applied ice to his troublesome left knee but the measure is now standard practice for Ronaldo designed to prevent any inflammation that might aggravate an on-going but controllable tendinitis problem.

He told Correio da Manha: ‘I am not going to pretend otherwise I would love to win my third Golden Ball.

Given these facts, what can cause animals to become dangerous among the following options: - threatened - Befriending them - influenza - hyperthyroidism - Helping them - Loud noises - Happy thoughts - steroids Answer:","response":"There are several factors among the listed options that can potentially cause animals to become dangerous. It is essential to understand that animals can react differently to various stimuli, and their responses can be influenced by their species, individual temperament, and prior experiences. The following options can cause animals to become dangerous: 1. Threatened: When animals feel threatened, their natural instinct is to defend themselves or flee. An animal may perceive a threat due to sudden movements, encroachment upon its territory, or perceived competition for resources, such as food or mates. In response to a threat, an animal might become aggressive or act unpredictably, potentially posing danger to humans, other animals, or even themselves. 2. Befriending them: While befriending animals might seem harmless, it can sometimes lead to unintended consequences. Especially in the case of wild animals, it is essential to maintain a respectful distance to ensure their safety and yours. Forming close bonds with wild animals can alter their natural behaviors, making them more reliant on humans for food or protection. Additionally, wild animals can carry diseases, and close interaction with them can increase the risk of transmission. Being overly friendly with a domestic animal can also have negative consequences if it inadvertently encourages aggressive or dominant behavior. 3. Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of hormones, leading to an overactive metabolism. In animals, hyperthyroidism can cause various symptoms such as irritability, aggression, weight loss, or increased heart rate. An animal suffering from this condition might become more unpredictable and, in some cases, may exhibit dangerous behaviors due to increased irritability or aggression. 4. Helping them: While the intention of helping an animal might be noble, it is crucial to exercise caution when doing so. For instance, attempting to rescue an injured animal without appropriate knowledge or skills might result in exacerbating the injury or causing both the rescuer and the animal to be injured. In their distress, animals might misinterpret a helper's intentions and turn aggressive, posing a danger to those in the vicinity. 5. Loud noises: As mentioned earlier, loud noises can startle and stress animals, causing them to react unpredictably and potentially making them dangerous. For example, fireworks or loud construction noises can spook domestic animals, leading to destructive or self-injurious behavior. Similarly, these noises can disturb wild animals, driving them closer to human populations or causing them to lash out defensively. In both cases, loud noises can make animals a potential danger to themselves and others. While the other listed factors - influenza, happy thoughts, and steroids - might have some indirect consequences, they are not directly responsible for causing animals to become dangerous. However, it is essential to monitor any changes in an animal's behavior and take appropriate precautions to minimize potential risks. Preventative measures can include maintaining a safe distance from wild animals, consulting a veterinarian for proper animal care, and creating stress-free environments for domestic animals."},{"question":"Малые реформы пролемы не решают.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly address how King Herod the Great died. The passage you found mentions some events that occurred after his death, specifically about the rule of his son Archelaus and the eventual incorporation of the region into the Roman Empire as Iudaea province. It does not explain the circumstances of King Herod's death itself. Herod the Great, also known as King Herod, ruled Judea from 37 BCE until his death in 4 BCE. His death was quite gruesome and resulted from a combination of multiple health issues. Contemporary historians, particularly the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, provide a detailed account of Herod's final days and eventual demise. According to Josephus, Herod suffered from a myriad of health complications during the latter part of his life, including chronic kidney disease, an intensely painful and itching condition that affected his whole body, fever, shortness of breath, and rotting of his lower limbs. The pain became so unbearable that Herod even attempted suicide, though he was stopped by one of his cousins in the nick of time. Ultimately, it was this constellation of debilitating and painful health issues that led to Herod's death. The sources attribute the king's ailments to a combination of natural causes and divine retribution for his cruel rule, which included persecution of the Jewish people and the killing of the innocents in his attempt to eliminate the newborn Jesus Christ, as mentioned in the New Testament. To summarize, the answer you found on Google does not specifically address the question of how King Herod died. Instead, the correct answer is that Herod the Great died in 4 BCE due to severe health complications, as recorded by historians like Flavius Josephus. The events following Herod's death, such as the judgements made against his son Archelaus and the incorporation of Judea into the Roman Empire, are separate from the circumstances of his death."},{"question":"Answer this question: when did they change armistice day to remembrance day??","response":"Armistice Day was first observed on November 11, 1919, to commemorate the end of World War I. The armistice between the Allies and Germany took effect on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. This day originally honored the end of the war and the bravery of those who fought in it. The name change from Armistice Day to Remembrance Day, as well as the shift in focus, varied across different countries and did not happen at the same time everywhere. The transition can be best understood by examining it through the lens of different countries in which these changes took place. - United Kingdom: The United Kingdom began referring to the day as Remembrance Day after World War II. While Armistice Day continued to be observed in the UK, the focus shifted to specifically include those who had given their lives in both world wars. A renaming process started in 1945, and the term \\"Armistice Day\\" was gradually replaced by \\"Remembrance Day\\" or \\"Remembrance Sunday,\\" with the latter being observed on the second Sunday of November. The purpose of the name change and shift in focus was to honor and remember the sacrifices made by all those who served in both World War I and World War II. - Canada: In Canada, the renaming occurred on January 17, 1931, when a bill was passed by the Canadian House of Commons, amending the Armistice Day Act and changing the observance of Armistice Day to Remembrance Day. The new name was officially instituted to emphasize the broader purpose of remembering the sacrifices of all Canadian soldiers, sailors, and airmen in armed conflicts, not just those in World War I. - Australia: In Australia, the move from Armistice Day to Remembrance Day began after World War II, around the same time as it did in the UK. With the Republic of Australia being established in 1948, the Federation realized that Armistice Day could not stand alone anymore, and the need to commemorate the fallen soldiers of World War II led to the recognition of November 11th as Remembrance Day. Australian states and territories can choose whether to observe Remembrance Day as a public holiday. Meanwhile, Australia still holds a separate day of remembrance for war dead on ANZAC Day, April 25th, which remembers service members of both Australia and New Zealand. It is crucial to note that in the United States, Armistice Day was also renamed and reframed to become Veterans Day, a change enacted on June 1, 1954, after World War II and the Korean War. Veterans Day honors all those who have served in the United States Armed Forces, while a separate day, Memorial Day, commemorates those who died in military service. In conclusion, the process of changing Armistice Day to Remembrance Day started after World War II in different countries and served the purpose of expanding the remembrance scope to honor and pay tribute to those who served in all major conflicts, rather than focusing exclusively on World War I. This transition varied across countries in terms of both time and the specific commemorative focus."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: I honestly believe we're on the verge of a revolution in our understanding of the universe. Czech:","response":"Upřímně věřím, že jsme na pokraji revoluce v našem pochopení vesmíru. Step-by-step process: 1. Translate the individual words and phrases of the original sentence to Czech. - I = Já - honestly believe = upřímně věřím - we're = jsme - on the verge = na pokraji - revolution = revoluce - in our understanding = v našem pochopení - of the universe = vesmíru 2. Adjust the word order according to Czech grammar rules. - In Czech, the verb (věřím) typically comes after the subject pronouns (já). However, in this case, \\"honestly\\" (upřímně) is added before the verb for emphasis, so the phrase becomes \\"Upřímně věřím.\\" - In Czech, possession is indicated by using \\"našem\\" (our) before the noun it modifies (\\"pochopení\\" - understanding). This forms the phrase \\"v našem pochopení.\\" 3. Combine the translated phrases to form the translated sentence. - Upřímně věřím, že jsme na pokraji revoluce v našem pochopení vesmíru."},{"question":"Tucson, Arizona: Southeast Tucson continues to experience rapid residential development.

Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer.

However, in this case, it is not necessary to include it explicitly in the sentence as the verb form itself conveys the subject. 'shove down' - The verb 'shove down' is translated to \\"strčit dolů\\" in Czech, which implies pushing something down or lowering it. In this sentence, it takes the first person singular form as the subject is 'I'. This conjugated form for 'shove down' is \\"strčím\\", which clearly indicates that the person performing the action is the speaker. 'her' - The possessive pronoun 'her' is translated to \\"její\\" in Czech, which shows ownership of the skirt by a female person. 'skirt' - The word 'skirt' is translated to \\"sukni\\" in Czech, which is in the accusative case as it is the direct object of the sentence.

Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. Rogers encountered financial problems on his return. Sir William Whetstone had died, and Rogers, having failed to recoup his business losses through privateering, was forced to sell his Bristol home to support his family. He was successfully sued by a group of over 200 of his crew, who stated that they had not received their fair share of the expedition profits. The profits from his book were not enough to overcome these setbacks, and he was forced into bankruptcy. His wife gave birth to their fourth child a year after his return--a boy who died in infancy--and Woodes and Sarah Rogers soon permanently separated. Rogers decided the way out of his financial difficulty was to lead another expedition, this time against pirates. In 1713, Rogers led what was ostensibly an expedition to purchase slaves in Madagascar and take them to the Dutch East Indies, this time with the permission of the British East India Company. However, Rogers' secondary purpose was to gather details on the pirates of Madagascar, hoping to destroy or reform them, and colonise Madagascar on a future trip. Rogers collected information regarding pirates and their vessels near the island. Finding that a large number of the pirates had gone native, he persuaded many of them to sign a petition to Queen Anne asking her for clemency. While Rogers' expedition was profitable, when it returned to London in 1715, the British East India Company vetoed the idea of a colonial expedition to Madagascar, believing a colony was a greater threat to its monopoly than a few pirates. Accordingly, Rogers turned his sights from Madagascar to the West Indies. His connections included several of the advisers to the new king, George I, who had succeeded Queen Anne in 1714, and Rogers was able to forge an agreement for a company to manage the Bahamas, which were infested with pirates, in exchange for a share of the colony's profits. At the time, according to the Governor of Bermuda, the Bahamas were \\"without any face or form of Government\\" and the colony was a \\"sink or nest of infamous rascals\\". Until Rogers obtained his commission, the islands had been nominally governed by absentee Lords Proprietor, who did little except appoint a new, powerless governor when the position fell vacant. Under the agreement that underlaid Rogers' commission, the Lords Proprietor leased their rights for a token sum to Rogers' company for twenty-one years. On 5 January 1718, a proclamation was issued announcing clemency for all piratical offences, provided that those seeking what became known as the \\"King's Pardon\\" surrendered not later than 5 September 1718. Colonial governors and deputy governors were authorised to grant the pardon. Rogers was officially appointed \\"Captain General and Governor in Chief\\" by George I on 6 January 1718. He did not leave immediately for his new bailiwick, but spent several months preparing the expedition, which included seven ships, 100 soldiers, 130 colonists, and supplies ranging from food for the expedition members and ships' crews to religious pamphlets to give to the pirates, whom Rogers believed would respond to spiritual teachings. On 22 April 1718, the expedition, accompanied by three Royal Navy vessels, sailed out of the Thames.

The group was formed in Paris in 1967 by Australian musician Daevid Allen and English vocalist Gilli Smyth. Band members have included Didier Malherbe, Pip Pyle, Steve Hillage, Mike Howlett, Pierre Moerlen, Bill Laswell and Theo Travis. Others who have played on stage with Gong include Don Cherry, Chris Cutler, Bill Bruford, Brian Davison, Dave Stewart and Tatsuya Yoshida. In August 1969, film director Jerome Laperrousaz, a close friend of the pair, invited them back to France to record a soundtrack for a motorcycle racing movie which he was planning. This came to nothing at the time, but they were subsequently approached by Jean Karakos of the newly-formed independent label BYG Actuel to record an album, and so set about forming a new electric Gong band in Paris, recruiting their first rhythm section of Christian Tritsch (bass) and Rachid Houari (drums and percussion) and re-connecting with a saxophonist called Didier Malherbe whom they had met in Deia. However, Tritsch was not ready in time for the sessions and so Allen played the bass guitar himself. The album, entitled Magick Brother, was completed in October. The re-born Gong played its debut gig at the BYG Actuel Festival in the small Belgian town of Amougies, on 27 October 1969, joined by Danny Laloux on hunting horn and percussion, and Dieter Gewissler and Gerry Fields on violin, and was introduced to the stage by bemused compere Frank Zappa. Magick Brother was released in March 1970, followed in April by a non-album single, \\"Est-Ce Que Je Suis; Garcon Ou Fille?\\" b/w \\"Hip Hip Hypnotise Ya\\", which again featured Laloux and Gewissler. In October, the band moved into an abandoned 12-room hunting lodge called Pavillon du Hay, near Voisines and Sens, 120 km south-east of Paris. They would be based there until early 1974. Houari left the band in the spring of 1971 and was replaced by English drummer Pip Pyle, whom Allen had been introduced to by Robert Wyatt during the recording of his debut solo album, Banana Moon. The new line-up recorded a soundtrack for Laperrousaz's movie, now entitled Continental Circus, and played at the second Glastonbury Festival, later documented on the Glastonbury Fayre album. Next, they began work on their second studio album, Camembert Electrique, later referred to by Allen as \\"the first real band album\\". It established the progressive, space rock sound which would make their name, leading, in the autumn, to their first UK tour. However, by the end of the year Pyle had left the group, to be replaced by another English drummer, Laurie Allan.

In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are. We are French[;] we are among the savages[;] we would like much to be Among the Christians such as we are[.] ... we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe neither in God nor in anything.

Options: - promotion - service account - sell products - get fired - work potential customer Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"If a salesman did not do his job right, several outcomes could occur depending on the specific flaws in their performance. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process for each of the options: 1. Promotion: If the salesman is not performing well, it is unlikely that they would be promoted. Promotions are usually given to employees who excel in their roles, contribute significantly to the organization, and show potential for greater responsibility and leadership. 2. Service account: If the issue lies in mismanagement of customer accounts or poor after-sales service, the salesman might be asked to focus more on servicing existing accounts, ensuring customer retention, and improving the quality of service provided. This can help the salesman improve their performance and regain the trust of their clients, but it does not necessarily imply a positive outcome like a promotion. 3. Sell products: A salesman's primary responsibility is to sell products or services. Failure to do this effectively could result from inadequate product knowledge, poor sales techniques, or a lack of motivation. The salesman may need additional training or mentoring to improve their skills and achieve the results expected of them. 4. Get fired: If the salesman consistently fails to achieve targets or perform their job duties effectively, they may face termination. This would typically be the result of a performance review where the individual is informed of their shortcomings and given opportunities to improve. If they still fail to meet the expectations of their employers in a reasonable timeframe, they may be at risk of losing their job. 5. Work potential customer: To improve their performance, the salesman might be advised to focus more on potential customers, increasing their customer base, and exploring new market segments. This strategy could help boost sales and bring the salesman to a standard expected by the organization. In conclusion, a salesman who fails to do their job right could face multiple consequences, such as retraining, being asked to focus on existing accounts or potential customers, or even termination if performance does not improve."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards.

The first way is to get _ on the specific things you want. There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost 1045, which included airfare and even the 130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only 256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it. If the guide that took me up Chimborazo hadn't dropped his price from 200 to 130, I would have spent 2 for a bus and gone hiking on EI Altar, another great Andean mountain.

I'm giving it 2 stars because it does somehow manage to fix the Wi-Fi connection issues temporarily, but the overall user experience leaves much to be desired. First of all, the interface is quite outdated and not user-friendly. It's difficult to navigate and I often find myself confused about what I'm supposed to do with the app. There's also a lack of in-app guidance or tutorials to help users understand the various features and functionalities. Moreover, although the app does fix the connection issues for a short period of time, I noticed that the issues often come back within a few hours. This is extremely frustrating as I have to constantly open the app and manually attempt to fix the connection multiple times throughout the day. Lastly, I've come across several bugs while using the app like random crashes and unresponsiveness, which only add to the already frustrating experience. The developers need to pay more attention to app stability, as well as improving its design and usability.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Article: Folk medicine keeps the body healthy by using medicines taken from surrounding plants and herbs . Since materialsfor making a medicine to cure a sickness can be found everywhere, one can practise folk medicine in any place of the world. The use of folk medicine goes all the way back to the time of the earliest man when both man and animal used plants and herbs to keep healthy. It is usually seen that an animal eat snakeroot after being bitten by a poisonous snake. Because animals seem to have this natural ability for knowing which plants and herbs will cure what sickness, man probably learned how to care for himself by animal watching. Man also learned other things from animals. He observed that wild animals, when sick, kept quiet and rest, getting well with the help of the medicine in plants and pure air. He saw that an animal with a fever could often be found resting in a cool place, eating nothing, and often drinking water until the fever was gone. Some believe that folk medicine deals with a lot of old wives' tales which have something to do with the medical treatment of the body. Stories are told about the powers of a certain vegetable material, which when hung around the neck, brings the wearer good health during the cold winter months. Such a story is simply a fairy tale.

Step 3: Dress appropriately If Ash decided to leave despite warnings, they should have dressed warmly, wearing layers of clothing, a winter coat, boots, gloves, and a hat to protect themselves from the cold and minimize the risk of frostbite or hypothermia. Step 4: Inform someone of their plans Ash should have let someone know about their plans to leave and their intended destination, so someone would be aware of their whereabouts in case of an emergency. Step 5: Bring necessary supplies Packing essential items like a small first-aid kit, a fully charged phone, a flashlight, a blanket, some non-perishable snacks, and water would have been helpful in case of getting stuck. Step 6: Plan a safe route Ash should have also planned a safe and familiar route, checking road conditions and avoiding any backcountry areas or hazardous paths.

After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the Scimitar. Initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the Enterprise crew discover the Scimitar is producing low levels of thalaron radiation, which had been used to kill the Imperial Senate and is deadly to nearly all life forms.

By the end of November, 1,100 bombers were available for night raids. An average of 200 were able to strike per night. This weight of attack went on for two months, with the Luftwaffe dropping 13,900 short tons (12,600 t) of bombs. In November 1940, 6,000 sorties and 23 major attacks (more than 100 tons of bombs dropped) were flown. Two heavy (50 short tons (45 t) of bombs) attacks were also flown.

The news break comes from an unlikely source: A plant chairman for United Auto Workers Local 900 responding to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's accusations in the first debate that Ford is moving jobs to Mexico. Bill Johnson, who represents workers at the Wayne, Mich., plant that made the Focus and C-Max compact cars now being moved to a plant in Mexico, told the Detroit Free Press on September 30 that Trump needs \\"to get his facts straight.\\" Trump said in the debate that thousands of jobs would be leaving Michigan as a result of Ford's decision to move its small-car production south of the border. Ford fired back that no jobs would be lost. The UAW supported this, with Johnson adding that while autoworkers \\"hate to see products go to Mexico,\\" the return of the Ranger midsize pickup truck and Bronco SUV will secure the future of UAW workers at the Michigan Assembly Plant more than the comparatively low-volume compact cars. The SUV/crossover is the best-selling segment in the U.S. The midsize pickup truck segment is hot with the return of the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon, and overdue redesigns of the Honda Ridgeline and segment best-selling Toyota Tacoma. These models, along with the Nissan Frontier, are averaging double-digit sales increases over 2015. Ford is missing the action, despite having the best-selling vehicle in America for more than three decades with the Ford F-150. Ford Vice President Mark LaNeve whetted speculation in February at the 2016 Chicago Auto Show by announcing the automaker will add four new SUVs globally by 2020. Yet Ford refuses to confirm the return of the Bronco and Ranger. \\"We do not speculate about future product plans,\\" Ford spokesman Bill Collins said, in response to what is becoming increasingly obvious. Automakers use carefully crafted promotional cycles to maximize interest — and media coverage — during the long introductory period of new models. Ford's unwillingness to confirm what its workers are planning for is less a denial than a preference to control that cycle. In place of specifics we have speculation, which dates back much further than 2016. In August 2015, John Wolkonowicz, a former Ford product planner and current independent analyst told Bloomberg the Bronco will have newfound appeal. \\"Gen Y has discovered the original Bronco,\\" Wolkonowicz said. \\"Ford has seen what the Mustang can do for them, and they are bringing back their iconic names.\\" Originally launched in 1966, the rugged two-door off-road vehicle competed with the Jeep CJ, now known as the Wrangler. It grew over time on a truck platform shared with the Ford F-150 pickup truck. Due to increased safety standards and the third brake light, it became illegal to remove the top in 1992, though there is ample evidence of users getting around that on Ford truck forums. After 30 years of production, and one infamous stint in 1994 as O.J. Simpson's getaway vehicle in a surreal televised low-speed chase as Los Angeles police pursued him for the alleged murder of his ex-wife and her boyfriend, the Bronco was discontinued in 1996. Vehicles were getting smaller and more fuel-efficient, and the versatile Explorer appealed to families as a minivan alternative while retaining some of the ruggedness of a utility vehicle. While the Bronco helped usher in the SUV-era, its demise helped enter in the crossover era. The difference between an SUV and crossover, which often are lumped together in sales statistics and marketing materials, is that SUVs like the Bronco were based on stiffer, rougher riding body-on-frame construction, same as a pickup. Crossovers are the same size, but have moved to the unibody construction used on cars for smoother, softer rides. The new Bronco is expected to be similarly sized to the Ford Explorer midsize crossover, but the Bronco should be a true SUV built on a body-on-frame truck platform. It should be more off-road capable, thereby able to better compete with Jeep's portfolio of trail-rated crossovers. It would make sense to share the platform with the Ranger midsize pickup truck, which was discontinued in the U.S. in 2011 but is still manufactured and sold in 180 other countries, including Mexico. It was redesigned in 2015 and shares a platform with the Everest three-row SUV available in Australia. Chances are the Bronco will look more like the Everest than the fanboy images going around social media, where all this speculation was ignited.

Cynthia Ann McKinney (born March 17, 1955) is an American politician and activist currently teaching at North South University, Bangladesh. As a member of the Democratic Party, she served six terms in the United States House of Representatives. She was the first black woman elected to represent Georgia in the House. She left the Democratic Party and in 2008, ran as the Presidential candidate of the Green Party of the United States. On June 30, 2009, McKinney was aboard the Greek-flagged Free Gaza Movement's ship Spirit of Humanity carrying 21 activists including Irish peace activist Mairead McGuire, medical supplies, a symbolic bag of cement, olive trees and toys, when it was seized by the Israeli Navy 18 mi (29 km) off the Gaza coast. It is unclear whether they were in international waters or in Gazan waters, which is subject to the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Although both the Cypriot and Israeli authorities were officially informed the destination was Gaza before the vessel's departure, according to the Cypriot government the ship \\"was given permission by the competent Authorities of the Republic of Cyprus to sail off the port of Larnaca in Cyprus on the basis of its declaration that its intended destination was the port of Port Said in Egypt.\\" McKinney was held at the Givon immigration detention center in Ramle, until she was released on July 5. McKinney initially refused to sign the deportation papers because they were written in Hebrew and that the papers would require them to admit that they were in violation of Israel's blockade, which they deny. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Israeli officials stated that the \\"Palestinian Authority and the rest of the international community had agreed to the off-shore blockade to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza.\\" The Palestinian Chronicle reports that such an agreement to the off-shore blockade never happened. \\"No Palestinians have agreed nor did the international community agree to a blockade of Gaza by land or Sea.\\" On June 17, 2009, a group of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) called for an end to Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. On July 7, 2009, McKinney was deported to the United States. The Israeli government indicated it will deliver the supplies via land.

Article: These days, most people in Britain and the US do not wear formal clothes. But sometimes it is important to wear the right thing. Many British people don't think about clothes very much. When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same. You'll feel good if you don't look too different from everyone else. Question: At concerts British business people wear _ .

Step 1: Identify the main idea in the sentence. This sentence describes the feature of a piece of clothing, specifically a \\"diamond-sewn seam at the crotch.\\" Step 2: Determine whether any about part of the sentence needs further clarification. The sentence looks balanced and complete without any additional information. Step 3: Apply punctuation based on the above analysis. In this case, the sentence doesn't require any commas, semicolons, or colons. The only punctuation needed is a hyphen to create a compound adjective. By combining \\"diamond\\" and \\"sewn\\" with a hyphen, we create a more precise description of the seam: \\"Diamond-sewn seam.\\" This gives the reader a clear understanding of the unique feature of the seam. Step 4: End the sentence with a period, as this is a simple declarative sentence presenting a single idea."},{"question":"Information: - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - The Flame Knife is a 1955 fantasy novella written by Robert E. Howard and L. Sprague de Camp featuring Howard's seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was revised by de Camp from Howard's original story, a then-unpublished non-fantasy Oriental tale that featured Francis X. Gordon titled \\"Three-Bladed Doom\\". De Camp changed the names of the characters, added the fantastic element, and recast the setting into Howard's Hyborian Age. The story was first published in the hardbound collection \\"Tales of Conan\\" (Gnome Press, 1955), and subsequently appeared in the paperback collection \\"Conan the Wanderer\\" (Lancer Books, 1968), as part of which it has been translated into German, Japanese, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. It was published by itself in paperback book form by Ace Books in 1981, in an edition profusely illustrated by Esteban Maroto. - Conan the Destroyer is a 1984 American sword and sorcery/adventure film directed by Richard Fleischer, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mako Iwamatsu reprising their roles as Conan and Akiro the wizard, respectively. The cast also includes Grace Jones, Wilt Chamberlain, Tracey Walter and Olivia d'Abo. It is the sequel to \\"Conan the Barbarian\\". The film was moderately successful at the box office in the U.S., and very successful internationally, although critical response was not as strong as for the original film. - Conan the Barbarian (also known as Conan the Cimmerian) is a fictional sword and sorcery hero who originated in pulp fiction magazines and has since been adapted to books, comics, several films (including \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" and \\"Conan the Destroyer\\"), television programs (cartoon and live-action), video games, role-playing games and other media. The character was created by writer Robert E. Howard in 1932 via a series of fantasy stories published in \\"Weird Tales\\" magazine. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Lancer Books was a publisher of paperback books operated from 1961 through 1973 by Irwin Stein and Walter Zacharius. While it published stories of a number of genres, it was noted most for its science fiction and fantasy, particularly its series of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian tales, the first publication of many in paperback format. It published the controversial novel \\"Candy\\" by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg and the ribald series \\"The Man From O.R.G.Y.\\" Lancer paperbacks had a distinctive appearance, many bearing mauve or green page edging. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Conan the Wanderer is a 1968 collection of four fantasy short stories written by Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter featuring Howard's seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. Most of the stories were originally published in various fantasy magazines. The book has been reprinted a number of times since by various publishers, and has also been translated into German, Japanese, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Italian. It was later gathered together with \\"Conan the Adventurer\\" and \\"Conan the Buccaneer\\" into the omnibus collection \\"The Conan Chronicles 2\\" (1990). - Hans Stefan Santesson (born 8 July 1914, in Paris, France died 18 February 1975), was an American editor, writer, and reviewer. He edited the selections of the Unicorn Mystery Book Club in the latter 1940s and early 1950s, the magazines \\"Fantastic Universe\\" from 1956 to 1960, the US edition of the British \\"New Worlds Science Fiction\\" in 1960 and the US version of \\"The Saint Mystery Magazine\\" from 1959 to 1967, and went on to edit several science fiction and fantasy anthologies, including: - Weird Tales is an American fantasy and horror fiction pulp magazine founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in March 1923. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom would go on to be popular writers, but within a year the magazine was in financial trouble. Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger and refinanced \\"Weird Tales\\", with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor. The first issue under Wright's control was dated November 1924. The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks it prospered over the next fifteen years. Under Wright's control the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \\"The Unique Magazine\\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction. - Tales of Conan is a 1955 collection of four fantasy short stories written by Robert E. Howard and L. Sprague de Camp featuring Howard 's seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian . The tales as originally written by Howard were adventure yarns mostly set in the Middle Ages ; they were rewritten as Conan stories by de Camp , who also added the fantastic element . Three of the stories also appeared in the fantasy magazine Fantastic Universe , two of them before publication of the collection and the other one after . The book has also been translated into Japanese . The collection never saw publication in paperback ; instead , its component stories were split up and distributed among other \`\` Conan '' collections . \`\` The Flame Knife '' was later also published as an independent paperback . Chronologically , the four short stories collected as Tales of Conan represent an add - on to Gnome 's Conan series , coming between stories published in the remaining volumes . The first \`\` tale '' would fall within the collection The Coming of Conan , the second between that volume and the collection Conan the Barbarian , the third within Conan the Barbarian , and the fourth between that volume and the collection The Sword of Conan . - Gnome Press was an American small-press publishing company primarily known for publishing many science fiction classics. Gnome was one of the most eminent of the fan publishers of SF, producing 86 titles in its lifespan many considered classic works of SF and Fantasy today. Gnome was important in the transitional period between Genre SF as a magazine phenomenon and its arrival in mass-market book publishing, but proved too underfunded to make the leap from fan-based publishing to the professional level. The company existed for just over a decade, ultimately failing due to inability to compete with major publishers who also started to publish science fiction. In its heyday, Gnome published many of the major SF authors, and in some cases, as with Robert E Howard's Conan series (published in six books from 1950-1955) and Isaac Asimov's Foundation series (published in three books from 1951-1953), was responsible for the manner in which their stories were collected into book form. - Leo Margulies (June 22, 1900 December 26, 1975) was an American editor and publisher of science fiction and fantasy pulp magazines and paperback books. - Ace Books is an American specialty publisher of science fiction and fantasy books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, gothic novels, media tie-in novelizations, and romances. Ace became known for the \\"tête-bêche\\" binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this \\"Ace Double\\" format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound \\"tête-bêche\\", until 1973. - Fantastic Universe was a U.S. science fiction magazine which began publishing in the 1950s. It ran for 69 issues, from June 1953 to March 1960, under two different publishers. It was part of the explosion of science fiction magazine publishing in the 1950s in the United States, and was moderately successful, outlasting almost all of its competitors. The main editors were Leo Margulies (19541956) and Hans Stefan Santesson (19561960); under Santesson's tenure the quality declined somewhat, and the magazine became known for printing much UFO-related material. A collection of stories from the magazine, edited by Santesson, appeared in 1960 from Prentice-Hall, titled \\"The Fantastic Universe Omnibus\\".

In budding, a small outgrowth or bud forms on the parent cell. This bud will grow and eventually breakaway from the parent cell, forming a new individual yeast cell. This process does not involve the fusion of gametes, which is why it is classified as an asexual mode of reproduction. The new yeast cells are genetically identical to the parent cells, as there is no genetic recombination taking place during this process. The rapid reproduction of yeast through budding helps bread dough to rise, as yeast ferments the sugars in the dough and produce carbon dioxide gas, which makes the bread light and airy."},{"question":"USS \\"Elrod\\" (FFG-55), an \\"Oliver Hazard Perry\\"-class frigate, is a ship of the United States Navy named after Captain Henry T.

The text discusses the USS Elrod (FFG-55), an Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate named after Captain Henry T. Elrod, who was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. The connection between the Medal of Honor and Oliver Hazard Perry comes from the class of the ship, not any direct connection between Perry and the medal itself. Oliver Hazard Perry (1785–1819) was a United States Navy commodore who is best known for his heroic role in the War of 1812, particularly during the Battle of Lake Erie. While it is clear that Perry was a highly respected and decorated naval officer, there is no provided information about his personal opinions on the Medal of Honor, which was established in 1861, long after Perry's death.

Given the context: What does Lee need to do before this? OPTIONS: A). order a beer; B). pay some money; C). have a quick lunch;","response":"Before Lee tore open the bag when the server brought him his fast food order, he needed to pay some money (Option B). Here is a possible detailed scenario illustrating the steps Lee went through before opening his fast food bag: 1. Decide to eat out: Lee might have been in a hurry, running errands, or just craving some fast food. Regardless of the reason, he decided to eat out and visited a nearby fast food restaurant. 2. Choose a restaurant: Lee chose a fast food restaurant that offered the type of food he was in the mood for. It could be a burger joint, a fried chicken place, or any other fast food establishment. 3. Pick a meal: Upon entering the restaurant or viewing its menu board, Lee would have browsed through the available options - considering the various food items, meal deals, and prices before making a decision. He might have had a favorite dish or decided to try something new. 4. Place the order: After settling on a meal, Lee proceeded to the counter or the ordering kiosk to place his order. He would have specified any customizations or preferences, such as adding extra sauce, removing pickles, or choosing a drink. 5. Pay for the order: This is the crucial step where Lee pays the required amount for his selected meal. Payment methods may vary depending on the restaurant; options could include cash, credit/debit card, or even digital payment platforms such as a mobile app or Apple Pay. Lee must ensure his bill is settled before he can proceed to enjoy his meal. 6. Wait for the food: After paying, Lee would have stepped aside and waited for the server to prepare his order. During this time, he could find a place to sit or simply stand and observe other customers or the staff. 7. Receive the food: Once the food is ready, the server would then call out Lee's name or order number, indicating that his order is complete. At this point, Lee would approach the counter to collect his bag of fast food. 8. Tearing open the bag: With his hunger potentially growing, Lee eagerly tore open the fast food bag when the server handed it to him. It is important to note that Option A (ordering a beer) could be a viable choice for Lee if he was at a fast food restaurant that serves alcoholic beverages, and he wished to enjoy a beer with his meal. However, this would typically occur after he has already paid for his order. Option C (having a quick lunch) would not be necessary before tearing open his fast food bag, as the act of tearing open the bag implies that Lee is about to have his quick lunch."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A construction site tearing apart a wall with graffiti.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A wall has writing on it.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: The film covers the life of Moses from his discovery in a basket floating on the Nile as a baby by Bithiah, a childless young widow and daughter of the then-Pharaoh, Rameses I, to his prohibition from entering the land of Israel in the wake of God's judgment on him at the waters of Meribah. In between, the film depicts the early adulthood of Moses as a beloved foster son of Pharaoh Seti I (brother of Bithiah) and general of his armies, his romance with Throne Princess Nefertari (or Nefretiri, as she is called in the film) and rivalry with the Pharaoh's own son, Prince Rameses II.Shortly after Moses' birth, Rameses I had ordered the slaying of all firstborn male Hebrews to prevent the prophecy of the Deliverer from coming true. Moses' mother (called \\"Yoshebel\\" in the film) had set him adrift on the Nile to escape, with his sister Miriam watching from a hidden spot. Bithiah discovers the Ark while playing with other young women in the banks of the Nile. She orders them to leave, then shows her servant Memnet the baby. Memnet warned Bithiah that the swaddling cloth was Levite, so the baby was placed there to escape Bithiah's father's edict. But Bithiah declared that this baby would be her son, and remembered when the pyramids were dust, and named \\"Moses\\" because she had drawn him from the Nile (the Hebrew name \\"Moshe\\" derived from the Hebrew word \\"Mashu\\", meaning \\"to draw\\"). Despite Memnet's protests about serving a son of Hebrew slaves, Bithiah ordered her to serve him and to swear to secrecy on pain of death. But Memnet hides the cloth under her clothes.As a young general, Moses is victorious in a war with the Nubian people of ancient Ethiopia, loosing captured ibises to combat the serpents (as recorded by Josephus) and further impresses Seti I by being wily enough to enter into an alliance with the conquered Ethiopians rather than subjugate them. Moses then is charged with building a treasure city for Seti's Jubilee, that Rameses failed to complete (probably the Biblical treasure cities of Pithom and Ramases...

Are there any other services like askmytargetmarket.com that can give feedback from small local business owners? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"Yes, many restaurant owners have used mystery dining services to get customer feedback. Mystery dining, also known as secret shopping or mystery shopping, is a tool employed by businesses, including restaurants, to measure and evaluate customer experience, staff performance, and operational quality. This approach involves the recruitment of anonymous individuals, known as mystery diners, who visit the establishment as regular customers while secretly observing and assessing service quality and overall experience based on set criteria. Mystery dining can be beneficial to restaurant owners in several ways: 1. Objective observation: By using anonymous and trained individuals, restaurant owners receive an unbiased perspective on their services, which highlights areas that need improvement or those that excel. 2. Enhanced customer experience: Mystery diners can evaluate the overall customer journey from making a reservation (if applicable) to receiving the final bill, providing insights on how to improve customer experience at various stages. 3. Staff performance evaluation: Mystery dining can reveal staff strengths and weaknesses in terms of service, politeness, attentiveness, and knowledge about the menu. 4. Compliance with regulations: Mystery shoppers can evaluate whether a restaurant is compliant with food safety regulations, cleanliness standards, and other rules. 5. Competitor analysis: Comparing results from mystery dining evaluations with industry benchmarks or competitors' assessment can help restaurateurs comprehend where they stand relative to others. Apart from mystery dining services, there are other market research platforms available for small local business owners, similar to AskMyTargetMarket.com, which can provide valuable feedback. Some popular alternatives include: 1. SurveyMonkey Audience: This platform specializes in providing access to a global pool of respondents, which can be further refined based on demographics and market segments.

Google Surveys: Google Surveys is a simple and affordable way to gain feedback from customers. Users can create custom surveys, select target audience, and analyze results using an automatic system. The tool integrates easily with Google Analytics, allowing business owners to have a holistic view of their online presence and target audience. 3.

The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt. Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday.

In this case, the most suitable translation is \\"suitable for me.\\" - \\"Değil\\" is a negation term in Turkish, which means \\"not\\" or \\"isn't\\" in English. - \\"Artık\\" is a Turkish word that is often used at the end of a sentence to add emphasis, and it means \\"anymore\\" or \\"no longer\\" in English.

Believing that Ray's soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches it back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll ten years ago. The incantations seemingly fail to produce results, but Chucky suddenly springs to life and kills Tiffany's Goth admirer Damien while Tiffany looks on with excitement. Later, Tiffany and Chucky have an argument because Tiffany believed that Chucky wanted to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, Tiffany locks Chucky in a playpen, and gives him another doll in a wedding dress to make fun of him. Chucky escapes the play pen and kills Tiffany by electrocuting her. He then uses the same voodoo ritual to transfer her soul into the bride doll so she could feel what he went through as a living doll. Still intent on becoming human again, Chucky plans to retrieve the magical amulet that was buried with Ray's body, and use the bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse and his girlfriend Jade as hosts for their souls. Tiffany sends Jesse a message asking him to transport the two dolls to New Jersey in exchange for money. Jesse convinces Jade to go with him. As they pack up, Jade's strict and overprotective uncle Warren plants a bag of marijuana in Jesse's van to frame him. Chucky and Tiffany set up a car airbag to launch nails into his face, then hide the body. The oblivious Jesse and Jade return and begin their trip. Outside a convenience store, they are pulled over by Officer Norton, who searches Jesse's car and finds the marijuana. As he goes back to his patrol car to report it, Chucky causes the car to explode, and Jesse and Jade flee the scene. They stop at a wedding chapel/hotel and get married. Meanwhile, Warren, still alive, tries to escape but is stabbed and killed by Chucky. While Jesse and Jade are at the hotel, a con artist couple steal...

Let the concrete dry completely. Sweep off the concrete with a stiff-bristled push broom. Cover control and expansion joints with weather stripping. Article:","response":"Title: How to Clean and Protect Your Concrete Surface: A Comprehensive Guide Using Power Washers and Weather Stripping Introduction Concrete surfaces are known for their durability and low maintenance; however, over time, dirt, grime, and loose concrete can accumulate, leaving your once-pristine surface looking worn and neglected. Proper upkeep and cleaning can help maintain the longevity and curb appeal of your concrete. In this article, we will guide you through the process of using a power washer to remove dirt and debris, and safeguarding your concrete's control and expansion joints. Step 1: Prep Your Concrete Surface Before you start, it is essential to clear the concrete surface of any debris or obstacles that could interfere with the washing process. This includes removing any furniture, pots, or other items. After the area is clear, sweep off the surface using a stiff-bristled push broom to eliminate loose dirt, leaves, and other debris. Step 2: Select the Right Power Washer A power washer works wonders in removing stubborn dirt and grime from your concrete surface. It is crucial to choose the right type of power washer to suit your cleaning needs. Pressure washers come in either gas or electric-powered models, with varying levels of pressure measured in pounds per square inch (PSI). Generally, a pressure washer with a pressure range of 2000-3000 PSI will be suitable for most residential concrete cleaning projects. Step 3: Use the Power Washer Correctly Once you have selected the appropriate power washer, take the time to familiarize yourself with its operation and safety features. Begin by attaching the proper nozzle for concrete surfaces, typically a 15- or 25-degree nozzle. These nozzles produce a wider spray pattern that minimizes the risk of damaging your concrete. Next, start the power washer following the manufacturer's instructions, and then stand at a safe distance from the concrete surface. Aim the spray at an angle to ensure the pressure doesn't create gouges in the concrete. While adequately controlling the spray, move in a steady, linear pattern along the surface. Overlap each pass slightly to ensure full coverage and avoid streaking or creating lines. Step 4: Let the Concrete Dry Completely After you have finished power washing the surface, give the concrete ample time to dry completely. It is common for drying to take at least 24 hours, depending on temperature, humidity, and sunlight. It may be helpful to wait an additional day to guarantee the concrete is thoroughly dry, especially if sealing or painting it afterward. Step 5: Protect Your Concrete's Control and Expansion Joints Control and expansion joints play a critical role in allowing your concrete to expand and contract with changes in temperature, preventing cracks. However, these joints can sometimes become a breeding ground for weeds, debris, and water damage. To protect your joints, first ensure they are clean and free of any dirt or grime. One method for safeguarding these joints is to cover them with weather stripping. Purchase a high-quality, durable weather stripping material specifically designed for concrete joints. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the weather stripping, ensuring it is securely in place. Once installed, the weather stripping should provide a barrier against debris, weeds, and water intrusion. Conclusion: Taking the time to clean and protect your concrete surface using a power washer and weather stripping will not only improve its appearance but also prolong its lifespan. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can maintain the durability and aesthetic appeal of your concrete surfaces, ensuring they contribute to the overall ambiance and value of your property."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: Browns Cambridge eatType coffee shop; Browns Cambridge food Indian; Browns Cambridge customer rating 3 out of 5; Browns Cambridge familyFriendly yes; Browns Cambridge near Crowne Plaza Hotel","response":"Browns Cambridge is a family-friendly coffee shop located near the Crowne Plaza Hotel, known for offering a unique combination of Indian cuisine along with its diverse coffee selections, and has an average customer rating of 3 out of 5, making it a suitable choice for informal gatherings and casual dining experiences."},{"question":"Soon , some started to pack up to leave .

Richard Cobb Answer:","response":"Step 1: Introducing the Main Characters and Setting To build the movie plot around the given prompt, let's first establish the main characters involved. Our protagonist is Radcliffe, a former investigative journalist who was disgraced after publishing a controversial article. Richard Cobb is a wealthy businessman with hidden secrets connected to the truth Radcliffe is seeking. The story will take place in a bustling urban city gripped by fear and filled with dark secrets that are waiting to be uncovered. Step 2: Establishing the Inciting Incident Our movie starts with Radcliffe, currently working as a private investigator, receiving anonymous documents from a mysterious source implicating Richard Cobb in a series of heinous crimes. Radcliffe recognizes this as an opportunity to redeem his professional reputation by exposing Cobb's wrongdoings and revealing the truth behind the conspiracy. Step 3: The Kidnapping Determined to confront Cobb directly and extract any kind of confession, Radcliffe carefully plans and executes the abduction of Richard Cobb. During the dramatic kidnapping scene, Radcliffe captures Cobb while attempting to avoid the attention of the city's police force. Step 4: Radcliffe's Scheme and Investigation As Radcliffe holds Cobb hostage, he presents him with the evidence and demands explanations. However, Cobb denies all accusations and pleads his innocence. To uncover the truth, Radcliffe begins an investigation, interrogating not only Cobb but also those around him in an attempt to piece together the whole story. Step 5: The Truth Slowly Unfolds As Radcliffe delves deeper into his investigation, he realizes that the truth is far more complex and dangerous than he initially anticipated. He unravels a vast network of power, corruption, and betrayal involving multiple powerful figures, including some people close to him. Step 6: The Climax In the gripping climax, Radcliffe confronts the mastermind behind the conspiracy, resulting in a tense standoff that puts both the hero's life and the final, shocking truth on the line. Step 7: Resolution and Conclusion With the conspiracy revealed and the guilty parties brought to justice, Radcliffe proves Richard Cobb is merely a pawn in the larger game, and his kidnap served as a catalyst. The end of the movie sees Radcliffe restoring his journalistic reputation, but at a price that leaves him questioning the morality of his actions and the world around him. In this movie plot, Radcliffe kidnaps Richard Cobb in order to uncover the truth about a series of crimes and a larger conspiracy at play, leading him through a dangerous journey of deception and moral ambiguity."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Rumours it survived in the Highlands were found to be true in 1992. Scientists are now studying the bees to better understand viruses transmitted by Varroa destructor mites. The chocolate-coloured native dark bees are Varroa-free. Experts involved in a European initiative called SmartBees, including scientists from the University of Aberdeen, hope they can provide previously unattainable insights into the immune system of honeybees. The native dark bees in the study are from colonies reared in a project near Beinn Eighe, a mountain in Wester Ross. These bees originate from eggs that were harvested in 2010 from a location 200 miles (321km) from Beinn Eighe. The original site of the dark bees is kept a secret to protect them from harm. The harvested eggs were put in small boxes which apiarists then taped to their skin under jumpers to keep them warm. Beekeepers later placed the eggs in \\"foster hives\\" and then raised them as queens.

She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong.

Here's a step-by-step process to design such a task: Step 1: Identify the fundamental principles of physics to be tested Determine which principles of physics you want the test taker to demonstrate their understanding of, such as force, friction, gravity, buoyancy, or pressure. This will help guide the creation of the task. Step 2: Choose a real-world scenario or situation Select a situation that would require physical reasoning to solve or explain, such as designing a bridge, calculating the trajectory of a projectile, or predicting the behavior of fluids. Step 3: Specify the objects and materials involved Clearly define the properties of the objects and materials in the task. This can include weight, size, shape, and composition. These properties should be relevant to the physical principles being tested. Step 4: Establish a goal or objective for the task Create a clear objective for the task, such as determining the optimal design for a bridge, calculating the necessary force to launch a projectile to a specific distance, or predicting the flow rate of a fluid through a pipe. Step 5: Create a series of steps or problems to solve Design a series of steps or problems that the test taker will need to complete to achieve the task's objective. These steps should involve applying the identified physical principles and the properties of objects and materials. Step 6: Set limitations or constraints for the task Introduce limitations or constraints that the test taker must adhere to, such as a maximum weight capacity for a bridge, the maximum force that can be applied to a projectile, or the maximum pressure a pipe can handle. Step 7: Provide resources or tools Specify any resources or tools, such as equations, diagrams, or simulators, that the test taker is allowed to use in completing the task. This will help ensure that the challenge is focused on physical reasoning and not memorizing formulas. Step 8: Determine the scoring criteria Define the criteria by which the test taker's performance will be evaluated, such as the accuracy of their calculations, the efficiency of their design, or their ability to meet the task's constraints. An example task: Design a bridge using only wooden beams and ropes that can support a certain load without collapsing. The test taker must consider the properties of the materials, calculate the forces acting on the bridge, and incorporate their knowledge of tension and compression to create a stable design that meets the weight capacity requirement. The task may have additional constraints such as a limited supply of materials or a minimum span length. Their performance could be evaluated based on the stability and efficiency of their design in meeting the constraints."},{"question":"Quoc: The fleur-de-lis / fleur-de-lys (plural: fleurs-de-lis / fleurs-de-lys) or flower-de-luce is a stylized lily (in French, fleur means \\"flower\\", and lis means \\"lily\\") that is used as a decorative design or motif, and many of the Catholic saints of France, particularly St. Joseph, are depicted with a lily.

The colonies were divided into three regions: the New England colonies, the Middle colonies, and the Southern colonies. While shipbuilding occurred in all these regions, it was most widespread and renowned in the New England colonies. New England colonies, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, were well-positioned for shipbuilding due to their location along the northeastern coast of what is now the United States. These colonies were in close proximity to abundant natural resources, including vast timberlands such as white oak, red oak, and tall white pines. This timber was essential to constructing the hulls, masts, and other ship components, as it was strong, durable, and widely available in the area. Another advantage for shipbuilding in the New England colonies was the presence of numerous navigable rivers, ports, and harbors. These waterways facilitated the transportation of goods, people, and raw materials, making shipbuilding a viable and attractive industry in the region. Furthermore, skilled craftsmen and laborers in these colonies were either immigrants from England or were trained by English shipbuilders, which contributed to the high quality and competitiveness of the ships built in the region. The Middle colonies, including New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, also had some shipbuilding activities, although not as prevalent as in the New England colonies. These colonies, too, were marked by their access to timber but were more focused on agriculture and trading. Shipbuilding in cities like New York and Philadelphia did contribute to the growth of these urban centers, and ships built in these colonies were often used for both commercial and military purposes. The Southern colonies, comprising Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia, likewise engaged in shipbuilding. These colonies were primarily agrarian societies that specialized in the production of cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, and sugar. Shipping and maritime trade were essential for the export of these products; hence, shipbuilding held significance in these colonies. Shipyards along the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal areas contributed to the shipbuilding efforts, although the industry was more scattered and less central to the Southern colonies' economy compared to the New England colonies. In summary, shipbuilding was a vital industry in the American colonies, but it was most concentrated and prosperous in the New England colonies. The combination of skilled workforce, abundant natural resources, strategic location, and an economy reliant on maritime trade enabled these colonies to excel in shipbuilding and created a legacy of expertise that shaped the future of American maritime history."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Play hockey for the following movie plot: Breakaway, or Speedy Singhs (the Hindi version of the movie), is the story of Rajveer Singh (Vinay Virmani), a young and dedicated teenager who gave up college half-way through due to his lack of interest, one of the many conflicts between him and his father Darvesh.

And just like your own childhood, this is a time for exploration and learning lessons. Regular play with other well-mannered dogs, who don't need to act to teach bite inhibition, will encourage her to play nicely around other dogs and you. Consider enrolling your puppy in a puppy training class, where your dog can learn essential skills while having fun. Take out a toy or bone and let her bite on it. This will teach her that her teeth belong on a toy or bone instead of on your skin. Playing rough with your hands is plenty fun, but it might be giving your puppy the wrong idea. Encourage other forms of play that don't involve your puppy nipping at your fingers, hands, ankles, and toes. Learn how to play fetch with your dog. Stick to the same rules every time you play. Learn how to play tug-of-war with your dog. Stick to the same rules to encourage your puppy to stop mouthing if she gets close to your hands. Provide plenty of interesting and new toys so that you keep your dog engaged. A bored dog is a lot more likely to seek attention from you by biting. Cycle out your toys so that your dog is less likely to get bored. Before you start playing with your dog, spray a taste deterrent on areas of your body and clothes that you dog likes to play rough with. When your dog starts biting you, stop all movement and wait for her to react to the taste deterrent. Praise her and continue playing with her when she lets go. Some options for taste deterrents include bitter apple, vapor rub, tea tree oil, or white vinegar. Alternatively, you can spray breath freshener spray (such as Binaca) into the puppy’s mouth as both a taste and sound deterrent at the moment of a bite. Spray the taste deterrent on your body and clothes (if it is fabric-safe) for at least two weeks. After two weeks, your puppy will likely have developed a strong distaste for your hands and ankles. A well-exercised puppy (exercised to the point of being tired) will not be as rough when playing with you. This will help avoid forming bad habits in the first place. A tired puppy is often a well-behaved puppy. It's sometimes tempting to want to physically punish your puppy by slapping, hitting, or waving your fingers in her face. The problem is that these responses can do one of two things: they can encourage your puppy to continue playing rough, or they can encourage your puppy to act out with real aggression. Avoid other methods of physical punishment that might scare or intimidate your puppy. If you are contemplating this sort of retaliation, you should contact a professional dog trainer or veterinary behaviorist for assistance. You might not enjoy being bitten every time you go out to play with your puppy, but you do want to forge a real bond between you and your puppy, and playing is partly how you do this. Don't give up on play time just because your puppy doesn't yet know how to play gentle. Teaching her the difference between right and wrong, not abandoning play altogether, will be best for both of you. Summary:","response":"Playing with vaccinated dogs is essential for puppies to learn social skills and bite inhibition.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".","response":"The name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra is Handel."},{"question":"Review: The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans aren't as they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time. Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined? Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought. Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap opera-ish 70s made-for-TV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be. The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there. The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit\\"man\\"? Yeah, right! It's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked David Jansen. The movie also lacks any pace. Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had. With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made-for-TV movie. The lone highlight for me was the voice-over work from the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss listening to. The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest. Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start.

A: During his rule, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city. Does the answer correctly answer the question","response":"Sultan Quli was the founding leader of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, which ruled the kingdom of Golconda in South India from 1518 to 1687. Before discussing his position, it is essential to understand the historical context in which he rose to power and the role he played within the region. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk was of Turkmen origin and belonged to a family of nobles who served various rulers in different regions of the Islamic world. His foray into Deccan started as he entered the service of the Bahmani Sultanate – a prominent Islamic dynasty that ruled the Deccan plateau in the late medieval period. Through perseverance and loyalty, he climbed up the ranks, eventually gaining the title of 'Qutb-ul-Mulk.' Following the collapse of the Bahmani Sultanate, the Deccan region fragmented into smaller territories and Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk found himself in an advantageous position as the governor of the Golconda province in 1518. As the governor of Golconda, Sultan Quli's primary responsibility was to maintain law and order within his province and protect it from foreign invasions. He held significant power and authority in this position and used it to ensure the welfare of his subjects. Throughout his reign, he strengthened Golconda's defenses, established trade links, and encouraged progress in many fields, including agriculture, arts, and architecture. Sultan Quli’s reign witnessed a significant expansion of Golconda's territorial boundaries and his endeavors to develop the region. He commissioned the construction of numerous architectural wonders, such as the Golconda Fort, some of which still stand today. Quli Qutb Shah was a great patron of architecture and the city of Hyderabad was founded in his time as well, including the building of two iconic structures, the Charminar and Mecca Masjid. Under Sultan Quli's rule, the region saw impressive growth in various domains, and his legacy as a progressive and efficient ruler earned him a lasting place in history. In summary, Sultan Quli held the position of the founding ruler and governor of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, which ruled the Golconda Kingdom from 1518 to 1687. As the governor, he was responsible for overseeing the governance, defense, and administration of his province. During his reign, he undertook several initiatives that contributed to the architectural, economic, and cultural development of the region, making him a celebrated figure in South Indian history."},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Maria Malibran ( 24 March 1808 -- 23 September 1836 ) was a Spanish mezzo - soprano who commonly sang both contralto and soprano parts , and was one of the most famous opera singers of the 19th century . Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity , becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28 . Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range , power and flexibility as extraordinary . - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type. The contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although at the extremes some voices can reach the E below middle C (E) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.

Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"Sledging in cricket refers to the practice of players trying to distract, insult, or verbally intimidate their opponents to gain a psychological advantage. While sledging has resulted in many amusing and memorable encounters, it can sometimes cross the line and become insulting or offensive. Here are five notable instances of sledging in cricket, with a mix of some of the best and some that can be considered the worst: 1. Glenn McGrath vs. Ramnaresh Sarwan, 2003: One of the most heated sledging incidents happened during the Australia Tour of West Indies in 2003. Australian bowler Glenn McGrath and West Indian batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan engaged in a verbal duel, with McGrath questioning Sarwan's sexuality. Sarwan's smart reply infuriated McGrath further, leading to a confrontation. Though memorable, this sledging moment bordered on poor taste and is considered one of the worst. 2. Merv Hughes vs. Viv Richards, 1980s: This sledging incident is considered one of the most iconic. During an Australia vs. West Indies match, Merv Hughes sledged Viv Richards by telling him it would take a \\"fat bus driver\\" to get him out. Richards responded by hitting four consecutive boundaries before telling Hughes, \\"Man, you can drive the bus.\\" This humorous, competitive exchange is regarded as one of the best in cricket history. 3. Shane Warne vs. Herschelle Gibbs, 1999: The sledging between Australian spinner Shane Warne and South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs during the Australia vs. South Africa match in the Super Sixes stage of the 1999 Cricket World Cup is another memorable one. After Warned dropped a catch, Gibbs told him, \\"Now you've dropped the World Cup.” Later, South Africa lost the match, and Australia went on to claim the title, making this sledging incident even more significant. 4. Andrew Flintoff vs. Yuvraj Singh, 2007: During the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh got into an argument with England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff's comment on Singh's batting led to a fiery exchange. In the end, Singh vented his anger on England bowler Stuart Broad, hitting six sixes in one over and creating a world record. This incident shows how sometimes sledging can backfire. 5. Ian Healy vs. Arjuna Ranatunga, 1996: Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy and Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga had a sledging incident during the 1996 World Cup. As Ranatunga sought a runner due to cramp, Healy made a sarcastic comment: \\"You don't get a runner for being an overweight, fat bloke.\\" This instance highlights how sledging can turn personal and disrespectful. To answer the second part of your question, the two questions have slight differences in their meanings. The first question inquires about the best and worst instances of sledging in cricket while the second question specifically asks for the top 5 sledging moments without mentioning whether the instances should be positive or negative. However, both questions seek detailed examples of sledging incidents in cricket."},{"question":"How is \\"He was knighted in the 2003 New Year Honours.\\" said in German?","response":"In German, the sentence \\"He was knighted in the 2003 New Year Honours.\\" can be translated as \\"Er wurde in den Neujahrsehren 2003 zum Ritter geschlagen.\\" Here is a detailed breakdown of the translation: \\"He was knighted\\" - \\"Er wurde zum Ritter geschlagen\\" This part of the sentence includes the subject \\"He\\" translated as \\"Er\\", followed by the verb \\"was knighted\\" translated as \\"wurde zum Ritter geschlagen\\".

Elon Musk: The entrepreneur and innovative visionary behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink could lead to a clone with pioneering ideas in technology and space exploration. Step 1: Choose Elon Musk due to his multiple accomplishments and pioneering work. 2. Malala Yousafzai: The youngest Nobel Prize laureate and advocate for female education and human rights could result in a clone with powerful activism qualities and the ability to inspire change. Step 1: Consider Malala Yousafzai due to her inspiring story and commitment to advocating for education and human rights. 3. Lady Gaga: The multitalented singer, actress, and philanthropist is known to push boundaries in music and fashion. A clone could potentially become a creative force in various fields. Step 1: Choose Lady Gaga because of her broad range of talents and influence in pop culture and activism. Question 2: DNA is unique to an individual, but not to their location. Human DNA is composed of approximately 99.9% identical sequences, with the remaining 0.1% accounting for the individual's unique genetic traits. In the context of cloning, you could theoretically clone a man's hand by utilizing the DNA from any of his body cells, as long as you have access to a complete set of his genetic code. Step 1: Understand that DNA is unique to an individual, but not location. Step 2: Realize the possibility that a man's hand cloned without using hand cells but from complete genetic code. In conclusion, the answer to your question about whether the answers to these two questions would be the same is no. The first question primarily deals with potential outcomes of splicing DNA from three influential public figures, whereas the second question is about the uniqueness of human DNA and cloning possibilities. These two questions represent different areas of inquiry and therefore result in individual answers. Step 1: Compare the two questions and their answers. Step 2: Identify that the questions and answers address separate topics."},{"question":"This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement.

The man moved the lamp from the nightstand to the dresser because the","response":"soft glow was casting an eerie shadow in the room. As he adjusted the position, he tried to recall how this ancient artifact had come into his possession. It was found buried deep within the sands of a long-forgotten Egyptian tomb during an archeological expedition he had joined several months ago. The beautifully crafted lamp had caught his eye with its intricate engravings, curious markings, and an aura of mysticism that seemed to resonate from it. After a long day at work and with his curiosity piqued, the man decided it was finally time to investigate the lamp further. He pulled his overstuffed chair closer to the dresser, grabbed a magnifying glass, and began examining the engravings more closely. The fine lines and details reminded him of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, but there was something different, almost otherworldly about the script. As the man continued his inspection, he noticed a small, delicately carved button hidden near the base of the lamp. He hesitated for a moment, mulling over whether or not to press it. But the thrill of unraveling the mystery outweighed his fear, and he slowly moved his finger towards the button, his heart pounding in anticipation. The moment he pressed it, a blinding light erupted from the lamp, and a thick plume of smoke billowed throughout the room. Coughing and shielding his eyes from the brilliance of the light, the man stumbled back, watching in disbelief as the smoke took a more solid form. Before him stood a towering figure shrouded in billowing robes. The entity's face was concealed beneath a hood, but its piercing, ethereal eyes seemed to radiate both wisdom and power. The man, realizing he had unwittingly released a genie from the lamp, could barely stammer out a coherent sentence. \\"Who...what are you?\\" he asked hesitantly, his voice trembling with fear and a hint of awe. \\"I am known as Akila, the ancient one,\\" replied the genie in a booming voice that seemed to reverberate through the very air. \\"I have been confined to this lamp for countless eons, waiting for the one who would release me. And now, you have set me free.\\" The man gulped, trying to process the gravity of the situation. \\"So, do I get three wishes, like in the stories?\\" he asked hopefully. Akila chuckled, the sound rolling like thunder through the still, quiet room. \\"The tales of old are but a mere shadow of the truth,\\" the genie answered cryptically. \\"My power is limited to a single wish, but it is a wish without bounds or restrictions. Choose wisely, mortal, for what you ask is what you shall receive.\\" The man's mind raced with possibilities, his initial thoughts focusing on wealth, power, and immortality. But as the weight of his decision pressed down upon him, he realized he had an opportunity to make a lasting, meaningful impact on the world. Lost in thought, he considered the plight of so many suffering around the globe, the problems that needed solutions, and the dreams that could be made real. After hours spent pondering his monumental choice, he finally spoke. \\"I wish for the wisdom to enact positive change in the world, to make a difference that will help humanity thrive and find peace.\\" Akila's expression softened, his luminescent eyes seeming to reflect a sense of quiet approval. \\"Your wish is unconventional, yet noble. It shall be granted,\\" he intoned solemnly. As a torrent of knowledge, insight, and understanding flooded the man's mind, he felt the very fabric of his being expand and transform. Guided by the unprecedented wisdom bestowed upon him by the genie, he knew that he now had the power to shape a better world, where kindness, compassion, and hope would prevail. Empowered by his newfound knowledge, he dedicated his life to advocating for those in need, devising innovative solutions to global crises, and inspiring others to join him in his quest for a brighter, more equitable future. Over the years that followed, the man became a beacon of light in an increasingly dark world. He catalyzed the progress of human civilization, advancing science, technology, and the arts, and promoting peace and unity across all of humanity. His name became synonymous with positive change, and as his life had been irrevocably altered by that ancient lamp, so too was the world transformed by his actions. As for the enchanted lamp and Akila, the genie, their story faded into legend. They remained a secret, locked away in the man's study, a testament to the incredible power that had shaped a legacy. And while the mortal's time would eventually come to an end, the impact of his wish would reverberate throughout history, ensuring that the spark of hope he had ignited would never be extinguished."},{"question":"Which of these sentences doesn't make sense?

Detailed solution:","response":"Sentence B: \\"If you want the baby to laugh, you can shout at it\\" does not make sense. A more detailed explanation: Both sentences suggest ways to make a baby laugh. However, their approaches are quite different. Sentence A: \\"If you want the baby to laugh, you can make a face\\" - This sentence makes sense as making a funny face is a common way to entertain babies and make them laugh. It is a gentle and non-threatening action that babies usually find amusing. This statement is reasonable and practical, so it makes sense. Sentence B: \\"If you want the baby to laugh, you can shout at it\\" - This sentence does not make sense because shouting at a baby is not an effective way to make them laugh. In most cases, shouting at a baby is likely to scare or upset the child, rather than amuse them. Babies are often sensitive to loud noises and may react negatively to being shouted at, so this approach is not suitable for making a baby laugh. Consequently, this sentence does not make sense in the context of making a baby laugh."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: how many yards did newton get?","response":"Title: Assessing the Yardage: How Many Yards Did Newton Get?

Solve 23*b - 52*b - 338 = 213 for b.","response":"To solve the equation 23*b - 52*b - 338 = 213 for b, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation 23*b and -52*b are like terms (both have the variable b): 23*b - 52*b = -29*b So the equation becomes: -29*b - 338 = 213 Step 2: Isolate the term containing the variable (b) To isolate the term containing b, we need to remove the constant term -338 from the left side of the equation. To do this, we will add 338 to both sides of the equation: -29*b - 338 + 338 = 213 + 338 This simplifies to: -29*b = 551 Step 3: Solve for the variable b Now, we need to solve for b. Since the term with the variable is -29*b, we will divide both sides of the equation by -29: (-29*b) / -29 = 551 / -29 This simplifies to: b = -19 The solution to the equation 23*b - 52*b - 338 = 213 is b = -19."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step. Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Mosses are vascular plants that reproduce via flowers.\\" Options: - yes - no","response":"The given sentence states: \\"Mosses are vascular plants that reproduce via flowers.\\" Let's break this down and analyze the accuracy of the statement. 1. Are mosses vascular plants? Mosses are non-vascular plants, meaning they lack specialized tissues such as xylem and phloem for transporting water and nutrients. Vascular plants, on the other hand, possess these specialized tissues and include ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Mosses belong to the division Bryophyta, which consists of non-vascular plants. 2. Do mosses reproduce via flowers? Mosses reproduce through spores, not flowers. They produce small capsules which contain spores. When these capsules mature, they release the spores, and new moss plants can grow from them. Flowers are a reproductive structure found in angiosperms (flowering plants), which are a separate group of plants from mosses. Given this information, the sentence \\"Mosses are vascular plants that reproduce via flowers\\" is factually incorrect, and the solution to the question is: - no"},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question In week 9, the Lions hosted an interconference duel against the New York Jets. The only score of the first quarter was a 10-yard TD catch by the Lions' Brandon Pettigrew. The Jets responded in the second quarter with a 31-yard field goal by Nick Folk and later a 74-yard TD catch by Braylon Edwards just before halftime. The only score of the third quarter was a 1-yard quarterback sneak TD by Matt Stafford of the Lions; however the extra point attempt by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh (an emergency fill-in for injured kicker Jason Hanson, who got run into on the previous field goal attempt which gave them a fresh set of downs) was no good. Early in the fourth quarter, the Lions added to their lead with a Nate Burleson 2-yard TD catch. The Jets responded late in the quarter with a 1-yard TD quarterback sneak by Mark Sanchez. The Jets kicked a field goal to tie it up just before time expired, forcing overtime. The Jets won the toss and kicked a 30-yard field goal for the win as the Lions fell to 2-6. Which team allowed the most first half points?","response":"To determine which team allowed the most first half points, let's examine the points scored by each team in the first half of the game. In the first quarter, there was only one score: a 10-yard TD catch by the Lions' Brandon Pettigrew. So, the Lions scored 7 points (6 points for the TD and 1 point for the extra point). In the second quarter, the Jets scored a 31-yard field goal by Nick Folk and a 74-yard TD catch by Braylon Edwards. The field goal is worth 3 points and the touchdown is worth 6 points, with an additional point for the extra point, totaling 10 points for the Jets in the second quarter. So by the end of the first half, the Lions had scored 7 points and the Jets had scored 10 points. Therefore, the team that allowed the most first half points was the Lions, as they allowed the Jets to score 10 points in the first half."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: the rest of the boulder for the following movie plot: Somewhere in California, at the end of the Gold Rush, several horsemen come riding down from the nearby mountains.

Originally erected by Elias Magnus Fries in 1823 as Elvellacei , it contained many genera . Several of these , such as Gyromitra and Discina , have been found to be more distantly related in a molecular study of ribosomal DNA by mycologist Kerry O'Donnell in 1997 , leaving a much smaller core clade now redefined as Helvellaceae . Instead , this narrowly defined group is most closely related to the true truffles of the Tuberaceae . According to the Dictionary of the Fungi ( 10th edition , 2008 ) , the family contains six genera and 63 species . - A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms such as mushrooms and bracket fungi. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals. - Helvella is a genus of ascomycete fungus of the family Helvellaceae. The mushrooms, commonly known as elfin saddles, are identified by their irregularly shaped caps, fluted stems, and fuzzy undersurfaces. They are found in North America and in Europe. Well known species include the whitish \\"H. crispa\\" and the grey \\"H. lacunosa\\". They have been reported to cause gastrointestinal symptoms when eaten raw. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a DNA sequence that codes for ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are assemblies of proteins and rRNA molecules that translate mRNA molecules to produce proteins. As shown in the figure, rDNA of eukaryotes consists of a tandem repeat of a unit segment, an operon, composed of NTS, ETS, 18S, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, and 28S tracts. rDNA has another gene, coding for 5S rRNA, located in the genome in most eukaryotes. 5S rDNA is also present in tandem repeats as in \\"Drosophila\\". In the nucleus, the rDNA region of the chromosome is visualized as a nucleolus which forms expanded chromosomal loops with rDNA. These rDNA regions are also called nucleolus organizer regions, as they give rise to the nucleolus. In the human genome there are 5 chromosomes with nucleolus organizer regions: the acrocentric chromosomes 13,14,15,21 and 22. In Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts the rRNA is composed of different (smaller) units, the large (23S) ribosomal RNA, 16S ribosomal RNA and 5S rRNA. The 16S rRNA is widely used for phylogenetic studies. - <section begin=lead />The human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequence for humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\"), encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria. Human genomes include both protein-coding DNA genes and noncoding DNA. Haploid human genomes, which are contained in germ cells (the egg and sperm gamete cells created in the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction before fertilization creates a zygote) consist of three billion DNA base pairs, while diploid genomes (found in somatic cells) have twice the DNA content. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%) and bonobos.<section end=lead /> - The common name elfin saddle is given to a number of Ascomycete fungi in the order Pezizales. These medium to small fungi often have irregular saddle-shaped caps. Species include: - The Tuberaceae are a family of mycorrhizal fungi. It includes the genus \\"Tuber\\", which includes the so-called \\"true\\" truffles. It was characterized by the Belgian botanist Barthélemy Charles Joseph du Mortier in 1822. A molecular study of ribosomal DNA by mycologist Kerry O'Donnell in 1997 found that a small clade now redefined as Helvellaceae is most closely related to the Tuberaceae. - The nucleolus (or , plural nucleoli or ) is the largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, where it is primarily responsible for the creation of ribosomes via a process known as ribosome biogenesis. Nucleoli also have other important functions like assembly of signal recognition particles and playing a role in the cell's response to stress. Nucleoli are made of proteins, DNA and RNA and form around specific chromosomal regions. Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause of several human conditions which include diseases, disorders, syndromes and illnesses. - Gyromitra is a genus of ascomycete mushrooms found in the northern hemisphere. The genus contains about 18 species. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. What is the relationship between 'helvellaceae' and 'pezizales'? A:","response":"The relationship between Helvellaceae and Pezizales is that Helvellaceae is a family of ascomycete fungi within the order Pezizales. In other words, Helvellaceae is a subgroup within the larger Pezizales order. Pezizales is an order of sac fungi belonging to the class Pezizomycetes, under the phylum Ascomycota. The order Pezizales includes various families of fungi that produce sac-like fruiting bodies known as ascocarps or apothecia. Helvellaceae, best recognized for its elfin saddles of the genus Helvella, represents a distinct family within this order. It is important to note that this family has gone through some taxonomic revisions; molecular studies, specifically of ribosomal DNA, have helped to identify its closer relationship with true truffles of the Tuberaceae family."},{"question":"Choose from: +Yes; +No; The back of the worker was completely broken by Jesse at the time.

Article: According to the US Geological Survey, about seven million earthquakes strike worldwide every year--but fortunately, only about 1500 of these are of a magnitude of 5 or greater on the Richter scale. Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house. Keep supplies in your car trunk or an outside storage shed if possible. Pack whatever your family is likely to need, enough for three days to a week, including food, water, medication, first aid and personal hygiene supplies, flashlights, a portable radio, blankets, clothes and shoes, cash, or camp stove, candles, matches or lighters, and a whistle. Consider earthquake insurance for your home if you live in an earthquake-prone area. Regular homeowner's insurance doesn't cover earthquake damage. Question: We can learn from the passage that _ .

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

The total cost for all exemptions combined amounts to 926,700. However, the premise does not provide any historical data on the quantifiable costs for the Pension Consultant exemption or any of the other exemptions. This lack of historical context prevents us from reaching a firm conclusion on whether the 600,000 cost for the Pension Consultant exemption has been exceeded for the first time in over two decades. In order to prove the hypothesis, we would need adequate historical records containing the annual quantifiable costs of the Pension Consultant exemption for the past 20 years or more. By analyzing this missing data, we could confidently ascertain whether the given hypothesis is true or false. For instance, if the data reveals that there was no year over the past 20 years with quantifiable costs for the Pension Consultant exemption above 600,000, then we could conclude that the hypothesis is indeed true. On the other hand, if we find that in any year during the past two decades, the quantifiable costs were higher than 600,000, the hypothesis would be disproved.

In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council calling on the government of Myanmar to respect human rights and begin a democratic transition. South Africa also voted against the resolution. What other countries were in disagreement with the United Nations decision on Burma ?","response":"While the text provided does not explicitly reveal more countries that disagreed with the United Nations' decision on Burma (now Myanmar), it can be inferred that countries like Russia, China, and South Africa were particularly vocal against the resolution. These three countries demonstrated their opposition by either voting against the resolution or using their veto power within the UN Security Council. However, by mentioning a \\"divided United Nations General Assembly\\" in 2006, the passage implies that there were more countries that may have been hesitant or disagreed with the resolution. It is essential to look into the historical context and diplomatic relations among various countries during that period to gain more insight into the positions and actions taken by other nations within UN decisions. For a more comprehensive list of countries that may have expressed disagreement, one would need to refer to the official voting records of the United Nations General Assembly or the discussions surrounding these resolutions.

Irons' partner, Susan \\"Sparky\\" Sparks (Annabeth Gish), is crushed by a large slab of concrete in the ensuing chaos. In court, Irons reveals Burke's role in the incident and Burke is dismissed from the military. Because his weapons resulted in Sparks becoming a paraplegic, Irons resigns in disgust. Meanwhile, Burke hatches a plot to sell Irons' weapons to criminal gangs, recruiting a video arcade manager to help him carry out this deed. Irons witnesses a bank robbery organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape before he can interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals.

It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"Portugal formally administered Macau. Macau was a Portuguese territory from the 16th century until it was handed over to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Portugal's colonial history, including its administration of Macau, has played a significant role in shaping the country's national identity and its relations with other cultures. As a result of its colonial history, Portugal has experienced immigration from its former territories, including from Macau, and this has influenced the country's demographics and cultural landscape."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","response":"The last step of the process involves expelling the carbon dioxide from the lungs and out of the body. After the bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs, it is transferred from the blood into the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. The alveoli are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, through which the oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the blood and the lungs. As a person exhales, the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles relax, causing the chest cavity to decrease in size. This decrease in size creates a pressure gradient, forcing the air (which now contains a higher concentration of carbon dioxide) out of the alveoli and up through the bronchial tubes. The air continues to move through the bronchial tubes, into the trachea, and finally exits the body through the mouth and nose. During this process of exhalation, the carbon dioxide-rich air is removed from the respiratory system, and the body is prepared for the next cycle of inhalation and gas exchange. This continuous cycle of inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide is essential for maintaining proper oxygen levels in the body and ensuring the efficient removal of waste products generated during cellular respiration. The entire process plays a critical role in maintaining overall health and supporting the body's various functions, such as providing energy for daily activities, repairing damaged tissues, and supporting immune system functioning."},{"question":"For many people the Handi Life Sport brand is associated with the balls and the game of boccia Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","response":"For many people, the Handi Life Sport brand is associated with the balls and the game of boccia."},{"question":"The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling, providing for a yes or no Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties.

But Russia has said the UN must finish its investigation into the claims before discussing any resolution. Syria has accused the West of \\"inventing\\" excuses to launch a strike. \\"Western countries, starting with the United States, are inventing fake scenarios and fictitious alibis to intervene militarily in Syria,\\" Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi said on Syrian state television. By Assaf AboudBBC News, Damascus Syrians continue to go about their daily lives nervously, despite the intensification of media interest and statements about the possibility that Syria will face a military strike. Some families have decided to move to safer areas in the countryside far from the cities. Some of those who live near military sites or government complexes have done similarly, following the Syrian media's recent focus on the Syrian military and governmental targets that might be hit in a potential Western military strike against Syria. Despite this, Syrian government departments are continuing their work as usual, the shops continue to receive customers and the streets of the Syrian capital remain choked by traffic. Some Syrians were reassured this afternoon by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem and his defiant speech about the strike which the Western nations are threatening to carry out against Syria and its government. British Foreign Secretary William Hague told reporters the international community had a responsibility to take action against the Syrian government, even if agreement could not be reached at the UN. The Syrian government has strongly denied that it used chemical weapons and blames opposition fighters for the attack on 21 August, which reportedly killed hundreds of people near Damascus. A team of UN weapons inspectors is currently investigating the sites of the attack. UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon said the experts were expected to finish their investigation in four days and would need more time after that to analyse their findings. Mr Ban appealed for the team to be given \\"time to do its job\\". And in a phone conversation with Mr Hague, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a draft resolution should not be considered until the inspectors had reported. Russia and China have previously vetoed resolutions critical of Syria. In a separate development, Syria's ambassador to the UN, Bashar Jaafari, asked for the inspectors to investigate three cases of the use of chemical weapons in the last week against \\"dozens\\" of government troops in Damascus suburbs. Britain's National Security Council \\"unanimously\\" backed action against Syria over its \\"unacceptable\\" chemical weapons use, Prime Minister David Cameron said earlier on Wednesday. He had gathered the UK's armed forces and security chiefs with key cabinet ministers for emergency talks over possible military action, ahead of the UN Security Council meeting. On Thursday, British MPs are set to vote on a government motion condemning the attack, but the vote will not authorise direct UK involvement in military action. The motion says UN weapons inspectors should be allowed to report to the Security Council, after which a further vote on military action may be taken. Britain's proposed UN resolution would condemn the \\"chemical weapons attack by [Syria's President] Assad\\", Mr Cameron added. Mr Ban earlier called on the council's permanent members - China, Russia, France, the US and the UK - to act together. \\"The body interested with maintaining international peace and security cannot be 'missing in action',\\" Mr Ban said. He added: \\"Give peace a chance. Give diplomacy a chance. Stop fighting and... start talking.\\" The meeting of the five permanent members has now finished, but the UK, US and France are continuing talks. No representative of any of the five countries was prepared to comment officially after the meeting. Syria crisis: Western military options Models for possible intervention Press apprehension as Syria tension builds Syria crisis: Where key countries stand Meanwhile, in a briefing to journalists, joint UN-Arab League envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi said: \\"It does seem clear that some kind of substance was used... that killed a lot of people\\" on 21 August. But he also emphasised that any military action would need Security Council authorisation. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that US intervention would be a \\"disaster\\" for the region. \\"The region is like a gunpowder store and the future cannot be predicted,\\" Mr Khamenei said, according to Iran's Isna news agency. Meanwhile the Israeli government has authorised a limited call-up of reserve soldiers. Officials told the BBC that although the likelihood of Israel being drawn into fighting with Syria was very low, the country nevertheless had to prepare for that scenario. Stocks have fallen on global markets and oil prices have shot up amid growing concern about an impending attack on Syria. The UN weapons inspectors resumed investigations after having called off work on Tuesday because of security concerns. On Monday, the team's convoy was shot at by unidentified snipers. One of their cars came under fire as it crossed the buffer zone between government and rebel-controlled areas. More than 100,000 people are estimated to have died since the conflict erupted in Syria in March 2011. What is a summary of this text?","response":"There was a chemical weapon attack in Syria and many people are worried about it. Some countries think that the government of Syria is responsible for the attack. They want to take action against the Syrian government, but other countries like Russia want the United Nations (UN) to investigate first before deciding what to do. Meanwhile, people in Syria are doing their best to continue with their daily lives, even though they are worried and some are moving to safer areas.

Today, we are going to learn about a migratory bird that is becoming smaller because it is getting warmer in its home. Can you imagine getting tinier just because it's hot outside? Let's find out more about this little bird's story. A group of smart people called scientists have been studying a special type of bird that flies very long distances every year. These birds are called migratory birds, and they like to travel from one place to another when the seasons change. They do this to find food and a nice place to have their baby birds, also known as chicks. One of these migratory birds has been shrinking in size because it is getting warmer in the place where they lay their eggs. This place is called the Arctic, and it's usually very cold, with a lot of ice and snow. But things have been changing in the Arctic. The ice is melting, and the temperatures are rising. This means that it is not as cold as it used to be. Because of this warmer weather, the little bird is becoming even smaller! The scientists found out that the bird's body is getting shorter and its beak is becoming smaller too. They think that this might be because the bird isn't getting enough food to eat. As the Arctic gets warmer, it can be harder for the birds to find the insects they like to eat. It's important for us to help protect these little birds and their Arctic home. We can do this by learning about the environment and how we can take care of it, like turning off the lights when we don't need them and not wasting water. So, the next time you see a little bird flying in the sky, remember that they might be going on a very long journey, and make sure to take care of our planet so they have a safe place to live and grow."},{"question":"Read this: In Brazil, the Presbyterian Church of Brazil (Igreja Presbiteriana do Brasil) totals approximately 1,011,300 members; other Presbyterian churches (Independents, United, Conservatives, Renovated, etc.) in this nation have around 350,000 members.

All of these factors can hinder a child's cognitive development, potentially stunting learning abilities and leading to poorer educational outcomes. Though intelligence is a complex, multi-faceted attribute, and cannot be solely determined by poverty status, research has shown that children growing up in impoverished environments often face significant disadvantages in this area."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question Historically Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of American progressive theology.

When three-year-old Rohid Zamani and his family fled Afghanistan to escape the terrors of the Taliban regime, they could only hope to reach a better place. But never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined such a spectacular outcome for their little boy. While the family have built a new life in Britain, Rohid, now 16, has defied overwhelming odds to win a full scholarship to Eton. Rohid Zamani, 16, who fled Afghanistan to become a student at Sirius Academy, Hull, and now has been accepted for a scholarship at Eton College. His extraordinary story began in the city of Jalalabad, where the Zamanis lived in fear of the extremist Islamic rulers and civil unrest raging around them. Among the horrors they witnessed was a man who was decapitated because he put gel in his hair to style it. ‘He was dragged out in the street and they chopped his head off,’ said Rohid. ‘There were people getting killed for almost no reason. Every day we were afraid.’ His mother narrowly escaped death after briefly getting out of bed when a relative visited while she was ill. Rohid said: ‘Moments after she got up a bomb went off and shattered the windows. 'Level-headed': Rohid Zamani, 16, with his mentor, teacher Adam Rust, right. Rohid can reel off hair-raising tales of murder and violence that were commonplace under the Taliban. Rohid's father held a respected job as a civil engineer designing roads in Afghanistan. Rohid's family fled Afghanistan when he was three. This file picture showing Taliban fighters is from 1997, a year after the religious zealots came to power. ‘The shards of glass fell on the bed. If my mum had been there she would have been dead.’ Rohid’s father, who worked as a civil. engineer, decided to risk everything by fleeing the country with his. wife and two children. Their journey took them across 3,500 miles, including crossing rivers in Russia in a leaking rubber dinghy. Rohid said: ‘My mum was scared we were going to sink. She put her hand on the hole. ‘I was really scared. After that we had to wait for a van and the van broke down so we had to go through a forest. ‘There were wolves and dogs, everybody was just so scared.’ The family also became separated at one point. They spoke no English when they. arrived in Hull but they soon adapted and were allowed to settle in the. UK. And Rohid showed his dedication to learning early on. When the family moved to Birmingham to live near friends, the children weren’t happy. So Rohid, who was ten at the time,. took matters into his own hands and phoned his old primary school. teacher in Hull to ask if he could return. Headmaster Brian Roberts said: ‘I was working in my office late when I got a call from Rohid. Eton College is renowned in the UK as the school of choice for Prime Ministers and Royals. Royal students: Prince William, left, on his first day at Eton and Prince Harry, right, with his house master Dr Andrew Gailey. He said: “Mr Roberts, we are really. unhappy. If we come back to Hull would it be possible to come back to. your school?” I said I was sure it was a strong possibility.’ Rohid's ability also bought him to the attention of both Hull KR and Hull FC, who offered him a scholarship. His plan worked. The family returned to Hull and Rohid later joined the city’s Sirius Academy. As well as being bright and. hard-working, he excelled at rugby league and athletics. When the school. suggested Rohid apply for an Eton scholarship he jumped at the chance. and was among hundreds who took part in a tough four-day interview. process. ‘Luckily I was picked so I must have done OK,’ he said. He starts at sixth form in September, studying A-levels in maths, biology, chemistry and physics. Rohid’s father now works as a van. driver – but the family won’t have to pay a penny of the £30,000 annual. fees and have been given a £1,500 bursary to help cover school uniform. and other expenses. The teenager now knows there is no. limit to what he can achieve. He hopes to become a surgeon. Commenting. on the Eton life that awaits him, he said: ‘It’s a huge step, a bit like. going to university two years early. ‘But so long as I keep busy I will be able to adapt. ‘I will miss my family and friends but this is too big an opportunity to pass up.’ Mr Roberts, his old primary school. head, said of his move to Eton: ‘It doesn’t surprise me that he is going. on to greater things, because he had that vision of where he was going. in life.’ A spokesman for Eton said yesterday:. ‘We are delighted that Rohid has been awarded one of the sixth form. scholarships we offer at Eton. ‘He is obviously an extraordinary young man and will undoubtedly make the most of all the opportunities that Eton offers.’","response":"An inspiring story of overcoming overwhelming odds, Rohid Zamani, a 16-year-old Afghan boy who escaped the Taliban regime with his family when he was three, has won a full scholarship to study at the prestigious Eton College in the UK.

The doctors in Children's Hospital are asking for money for children's toys. Some children in the hospital must stay in bed for many weeks. Toys are needed to keep these sick children happy and quiet. Money for them can be sent to the hospital. After Mrs. Weeks read the story, she said,\\"This story gave me an idea.\\" \\"You want us to bring some money for the toys.\\"\\"We could bring some of our own toys for the children in the hospital, \\"said the boys and girls one after another. \\"Well, your ideas would be nice, \\"Mrs. Weeks said,\\"but mine is different.\\" Mrs. Weeks smiled. \\"Do you think you could make toys?\\" she asked. \\"Yes, yes,\\" the whole class answered. \\"Great!

The children in the hospital felt very happy to see the toys. The children in the class felt happy, too. A few days later, Mrs. Weeks read another newspaper story to the class: Some school pupils brought toys to Children's Hospital last week.

To provide a more detailed and elaborate answer, we can break down the various aspects of the sentence. Orthodox churches have been actively participating in the ecumenical movement, a movement that seeks to promote unity and cooperation among different Christian denominations. The ecumenical movement aims to foster dialogue and collaboration, aiming to bridge the gap between denominations without compromising their core beliefs. Orthodox churches are among the major Christian denominations that have been engaging with this movement. However, the reactions of individual Orthodox theologians to the ecumenical movement have varied. Some theologians have tentatively approved the aim of promoting Christian unity, recognizing the importance of fostering cooperation and understanding among Christian churches. This approval, albeit cautious, indicates a willingness to engage with other denominations in the pursuit of unity and collaboration. On the other end of the spectrum, some Orthodox theologians have outrightly condemned the perceived effect of the ecumenical movement, which they believe waters down Orthodox doctrine. This condemnation reveals a concern that participating in the ecumenical movement might lead to compromises in Orthodox beliefs and practices, diluting their distinctiveness and integrity. In this view, the potential benefits of the ecumenical movement could come at the cost of weakening Orthodox theological convictions. So, Orthodox churches have condemned the perception that the ecumenical movement waters down Orthodox doctrine. In conclusion, the original sentence does answer the question of what Orthodox churches have condemned the perception of, which is the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine due to participation in the ecumenical movement. The varied reactions of individual Orthodox theologians also show the complexity of this issue, as the discussion on Christian unity and theological integrity continues within the Orthodox community."},{"question":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: green trees by the lake on a sunny day","response":"Keywords are special words in a sentence that help us understand what the sentence is mainly about.

As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. He established the long-term political prominence of the Long family. A Democrat and an outspoken populist, Long denounced the wealthy elites and the banks. By 1935, Long's most recent consolidation of personal power led to talk of armed opposition from his enemies. Opponents increasingly invoked the memory of the Battle of Liberty Place of 1874, in which the White League staged an uprising against Louisiana's Reconstruction-era government. In January 1935, an anti-Long paramilitary organization called the Square Deal Association was formed. Its members included former governors John M. Parker and Ruffin G. Pleasant and New Orleans Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley. On January 25, 200 armed Square Dealers took over the courthouse of East Baton Rouge Parish. Long had Governor Allen call out the National Guard, declare martial law, ban public gatherings of two or more persons, and forbid the publication of criticism of state officials. The Square Dealers left the courthouse, but there was a brief armed skirmish at the Baton Rouge Airport. Tear gas and live ammunition were fired; one person was wounded but there were no fatalities. In the summer of 1935, Long called for two more special sessions of the legislature; bills were passed in rapid-fire succession without being read or discussed. The new laws further centralized Long's control over the state by creating several new Long-appointed state agencies: a state bond and tax board holding sole authority to approve all loans to parish and municipal governments, a new state printing board which could withhold \\"official printer\\" status from uncooperative newspapers, a new board of election supervisors which would appoint all poll watchers, and a State Board of Censors. They also stripped away the remaining lucrative powers of the mayor of New Orleans to cripple the entrenched opposition. Long boasted that he had \\"taken over every board and commission in New Orleans except the Community Chest and the Red Cross.\\" Long quarreled with former State Senator Henry E. Hardtner of La Salle Parish. While proceeding to Baton Rouge in August 1935 to confront the state government over a tax matter relating to his Urania Lumber Company, based in Urania, Hardtner, known as \\"the father of forestry in the South,\\" was killed in a car-train accident.

Therefore, this option is incorrect. (B) heating liquids: While heating liquids can induce chemical changes in some instances, not all chemical changes require heating. For example, formation of rust doesn't need heat. Hence, this option is incorrect. (C) Activation energy: Activation energy refers to the minimum amount of energy required for a chemical reaction to proceed. All chemical changes need enough energy to break the bonds in reactants and form new ones in products. This option seems plausible. (D) wavelengths and photons: These concepts are associated with electromagnetic radiation and light, which are not necessary for all chemical changes. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (E) Burning fuel and air: Only specific chemical changes related to combustion require fuel and air. This is not a universal condition for all chemical changes. Hence, the option is incorrect. (F) kinetic energy: Kinetic energy is associated with the motion of particles, and while particles' motion can be related to some chemical changes, it's not a necessary condition for all chemical changes. Thus, this option is incorrect. (G) electromagnetic energy: Electromagnetic energy can trigger certain chemical changes, such as photosynthesis. However, it is not a requirement for all chemical changes. So, this option is incorrect. (H) direct energy: Direct energy is not a standard term in the context of chemical reactions. Additionally, it's not specific enough to explain what all chemical changes require. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Christine tripped over the debris in the road unlike Carrie, because","response":"Christine was not as accustomed to navigating through the chaotic aftermath of the storm that ravaged their small town earlier that day. While Carrie had grown up in this area and had experienced numerous storms throughout her life, she had developed a keen sense of observation and quick reflexes, allowing her to evade the scattered wreckage with ease. Christine, on the other hand, had moved to the town just a few months prior and was still adjusting to its unpredictable weather patterns and their associated consequences. As she stumbled over the broken branches and remnants of shattered glass, Christine couldn't help but feel her heart race with a mix of fear and adrenaline. Carrie, noticing her friend's distress, slowed down her pace and offered a reassuring smile, extending a hand to help keep Christine steady as they continued their trek through the town's ravaged streets. They were both on a mission to assist their neighbors by checking in on those who might need help, and although Christine's inexperience with such situations was evident, her dedication to the community and concern for others remained unwavering. This storm would serve as a pivotal moment in their dynamic, with Christine's vulnerability inadvertently strengthening her bond with Carrie. As hours turned into days and the town began to heal from the storm's damages, so too did Christine grow more confident and resilient in her newfound environment. She started to observe the subtle changes in the weather and adopt habits that allowed her to navigate the storms more adeptly, which did not go unnoticed by Carrie. Their mutual concern for the well-being of their community, combined with their shared experiences of navigating the challenges presented by the storms, formed the foundation of an unbreakable friendship between the two women. Over time, whenever a storm hit, Christine and Carrie would be among the first to step up and offer assistance, their once contrasting levels of expertise now replaced by a strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie. In the end, Christine not only adapted to her new surroundings and developed the skills necessary to face the storms, but she also discovered the true essence of friendship and community spirit. Those around her came to respect and appreciate her unwavering commitment to the town and its residents, and it was all because she tripped over that debris in the road that one fateful day, unlike Carrie, who gracefully dodged every obstacle in her path."},{"question":"Here is a premise: To reach Carlisle, take the M6 north from Penrith, make an exit at junction 43, and take the A69 road left towards Carlisle city center.

Question: suppose more trucks take coal to the power station happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"If more trucks take coal to the power station, logically it should result in more coal arriving at the power station. However, your question assumes a situation where more trucks are taking coal but LESS coal is arriving at the power station. This perturbation could be influenced by one or more factors affecting the overall coal transportation. Here are some possible explanations: 1. Decreased Coal Production: Despite the increase in trucks, if the mine has reduced coal production, or there is a disruption in the excavation process, this would lead to less coal being available for trucks to transport, resulting in LESS coal reaching the power station. 2. Inefficient Truck Capacity Utilization: The trucks may not be utilizing their full capacity during each trip, either due to uneven load distribution or other logistical issues. In such a scenario, even if there are more trucks making trips, the overall volume of coal transported can still be LESS. 3. Longer Travel Time: If the route between the mine and the power station has become more congested or if the trucks are taking longer due to other factors, it could result in less coal arriving at the desired rate, despite more trucks being employed for transportation. 4. Breakdown or Truck Maintenance: If there is a higher number of trucks experiencing breakdowns or undergoing maintenance, it would reduce the effective number of trucks actually delivering coal, resulting in less coal arriving at the power station. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of more trucks taking coal to the power station while less coal arrives at the destination has potential explanations.

The three other men arrested are cousins in their 20s from an extended family, and face murder and rape charges, they added. But in a country with a long history of tolerance for sexual violence, the firings yesterday and the minister's comments were not a surprise to many in India. People in New Delhi march in protest against the government of Uttar Pradesh, where the two girls were found hanged after being gang raped. Protesters carried placards demanding the immediate arrest of all of those accused in the gang rape case. Untouchables: The family belongs to the Dalit community, also called 'untouchables' and considered the lowest rung in India's age-old caste system.

For this review, I will choose the film \\"The Emoji Movie.\\" Step 2: Briefly summarize the plot In order to critique a movie, it is important to provide a brief summary of its plot. \\"The Emoji Movie\\" focuses on the life of an emoji named Gene who struggles with his inability to display only one emotion, unlike the rest of the emojis in Textopolis. Step 3: Discuss the film's negative aspects As the purpose of this review is to be negative, I will focus on the problems and issues that \\"The Emoji Movie\\" presents, such as a weak storyline, poor character development, and its lack of creativity or originality. Step 4: Write the review using the information from Steps 2 and 3 Title: \\"A Disastrous Attempt at Emotion: The Emoji Movie Review\\" \\"The Emoji Movie\\" set out to explore the world of emojis and the inner workings of our smartphones, but instead, it presented a hollow and uninspired universe, leaving its audience with very little to connect to or even enjoy. The plot centers around Gene, a \\"meh\\" emoji who faces a crisis when he is unable to maintain his designated emotion. Instead, he displays a range of emotions, making him an outcast among the other single-expression emojis. This premise could have been the foundation for a clever, light-hearted story. However, the movie fails to deliver on its potential, providing a disjointed and underwhelming narrative with jumbled moral lessons that struggle to find cohesion. Character development is another area where \\"The Emoji Movie\\" misses the mark. The characters are one-dimensional, with little depth or motivation beyond their designated roles. In addition, their interactions don't contribute to the story in any meaningful way, leaving viewers with a lack of emotional investment in their journey. This film could have utilized its diverse cast of emojis to create intriguing and relatable characters but fumbles this opportunity completely. The most disappointing aspect of \\"The Emoji Movie\\" is its sheer lack of creativity and originality. A movie featuring the fantastical lives of emojis should capitalize on the creativity of the concept. Instead, it relies on lazy storytelling, forcing the characters into a series of uninspired set pieces that merely serve to promote various apps and products. What could have been a fun, imaginative adventure into the digital realm dwindles into an unoriginal mix of ideas borrowed and repurposed from other successful animated films. In conclusion, \\"The Emoji Movie\\" is a missed opportunity to explore the unique world of emojis by presenting a weak storyline, uninteresting characters, and a troubling absence of creativity and originality. With a premise holding such imaginative potential, it is disheartening to see the film swiftly devolve into a soulless piece of corporate consumerism."},{"question":"Pick from: 1. negative 2. positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? an appalling \` ace ventura ' rip-off","response":"Step 1: Understand the task This task requires me to evaluate if the phrase \\"an appalling \`ace ventura' rip-off\\" has a positive or negative connotation.

His backyard is 9 feet along the sides and 18 feet along the back. The neighbor behind him agreed to pay for half of their shared side of his fence, and the neighbor on his left agreed to pay for a third of their shared side. Fencing costs 3 per foot. How much does Cole have to pay for the fence? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Since Cole wants to fence his backyard on three sides, let's find out the total cost of the three sides first. The length of each side is as follows: 1. Side A: 9 feet (left side) 2. Side B: 9 feet (right side) 3. Side C: 18 feet (back side) The total cost for each side can be calculated by multiplying the length of the side by the fencing cost per foot (3). 1. Cost of Side A: 9 feet * 3 = 27 2. Cost of Side B: 9 feet * 3 = 27 3. Cost of Side C: 18 feet * 3 = 54 Now, let's consider the discounts that Cole gets on Side A and Side C due to his neighbors contributing. Neighbors are paying for a part of Cole's fence so, we will subtract these amounts from the total cost of each side: 1. Neighbor on the left pays for 1/3 of Side A: 27 * (1/3) = 9 2. Neighbor behind pays for 1/2 of Side C: 54 * (1/2) = 27 Now, let's find out how much Cole has to pay for each side after subtracting the contributions from his neighbors: 1. Cole's cost for Side A: 27 - 9 = 18 2. Cole's cost for Side B: 27 (The neighbor on the right isn't contributing to the cost.) 3. Cole's cost for Side C: 54 - 27 = 27 Finally, to calculate the total amount Cole has to pay for the fence, add the costs for all three sides: Cole's total cost = Side A + Side B + Side C = 18 + 27 + 27 = 72 Therefore, Cole has to pay 72 for the fence."},{"question":"Kannatamme tietenkin avoimempia ja yksinkertaisempia järjestelmiä.

It opens at the estate of King Herman the 6 7/8s, the deposed, abeit exiled king of Moronica. Meanwhile, Ixnay, Ohnay and Amscray, the war profiteers from the first film have realized they've made a monster out of Hailstone and his cronies in letting them be too power hungry. They decided that they have had enough of the dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. Herman refuses to accept thier help until he finds out that they were sorry about the whole scenario about wanting to start a war and are willing to pay the price for their actions. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring in the first film) to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Curly and Larry for a turkey (that is a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey.

Manni is a small-time criminal who has just collected 100,000 marks cash in his most recent crime. Lola had agreed to meet Manni at the crime scene and to drive him to deliver the money to his boss, Ronnie. Lola tried to do so, but her moped was stolen en route to meet Manni. When Lola failed to arrive on time, Manni, carrying the cash in a bag, took a subway train. Manni panicked when he saw ticket inspectors in his car. He fled and thoughtlessly left the bag of money on the subway because he does not have a subway ticket. As he does, Manni spotted a homeless man examining Manni's money bag in the subway car. Manni, realizing what he had done, pursued the train as it departed, only to find the man and the money gone. Manni calls Lola from a phone booth. He complains that Lola let him down. He tells Lola that unless he raises 100,000 marks to give Ronnie within 20 minutes, Ronnie will kill him. Manni also tells Lola of his plan to rob a nearby supermarketâwhich for several obvious reasons is unwise. Lola implores Manni to wait and promises to find the money.

The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. Do you have any questions?","response":"The Algarve region in Portugal has a unique identity compared to the rest of the country, offering a distinctive landscape and atmosphere. With a North African feel, the southern coastline is known for its stunning beaches, ochre-colored rock formations, deep green waters, and around 100 miles of coastline.

Tourists are drawn to the region not only for its beautiful beaches and weather but also for the variety of sporting activities it has to offer. Golf is particularly popular, with several courses situated along the dramatic cliffs and near the ocean. Other sports such as horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing can also be enjoyed in the area.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been... Question: After the end of this story, Miguel Diaz-Canel is probably === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","response":"After the end of this story, Miguel Diaz-Canel is probably facing pressure to bring greater prosperity and revitalize the Cuban economy, while maintaining continuity with the Castros' socialist revolution. He will also likely navigate working closely with Raul Castro, who remains the leader of the Communist Party."},{"question":"Fluids cannot generally be pulled, so a vacuum cannot be created by suction. Suction can spread and dilute a vacuum by letting a higher pressure push fluids into it, but the vacuum has to be created first before suction can occur. The easiest way to create an artificial vacuum is to expand the volume of a container. For example, the diaphragm muscle expands the chest cavity, which causes the volume of the lungs to increase. This expansion reduces the pressure and creates a partial vacuum, which is soon filled by air pushed in by atmospheric pressure. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What can be measured in the atmosphere?","response":"Various parameters can be measured in the atmosphere to study and understand the Earth's weather, climate, air quality, and related phenomena. Some of these measurements include: 1. Temperature: The atmospheric temperature is measured at different altitudes using ground-based weather stations, balloons, satellites, and aircraft sensors. This data is critical in studying climate patterns, weather forecasting, and understanding the vertical distribution of heat in the atmosphere. 2. Pressure: Atmospheric pressure, also known as air pressure or barometric pressure, is the force exerted by the weight of air above it. It is typically measured with barometers at weather stations. Pressure data is important for weather forecasts, studying air masses, and understanding how air moves around the planet. 3. Humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere and is commonly measured as relative humidity, which is the ratio of the current amount of water vapor to the maximum amount air can hold at a given temperature. It is measured using hygrometers and can impact weather patterns, play a role in cloud formation, and affect human comfort levels. 4. Wind speed and direction: Meteorologists measure wind speed and direction using anemometers and wind vanes, respectively. Data collected helps in analyzing weather systems, predicting storm paths, and understanding atmospheric circulation patterns. 5. Precipitation: Measurement of rain, snow, sleet, or hail that falls to the ground is crucial for weather forecasting, calculating water availability, and understanding climate patterns. Rain gauges and snow depth sensors are commonly used for this purpose. 6. Air quality parameters: Monitoring gases and particulate matter in the atmosphere is essential for assessing air quality and understanding the impacts of pollution. Some of the parameters measured include concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide. Measurements are typically conducted by ground-based monitoring stations, satellite instruments, and portable sensors. 7. Solar radiation: Radiometers and pyranometers are used to measure the solar energy received at the Earth's surface, which is critical for understanding the Earth's energy balance, studying climate change, and predicting weather conditions. 8. Cloud cover and type: Remote sensing instruments like satellites and ground-based weather stations determine the amount of cloud cover and classify clouds based on their characteristics. Cloud observations play a vital role in understanding atmospheric processes, weather prediction, and climate modeling. These are just a few examples of the numerous aspects that can be measured in the atmosphere, all of which contribute to our understanding of the complex and dynamic world that we live in."},{"question":"Cameron got up on the wrong side of the bed after staying out way too late the night before. Given the question \\"How would Cameron feel afterwards?\\", is \\"that Cameron was out too late\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","response":"No, \\"that Cameron was out too late\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would Cameron feel afterwards?\\" because it does not describe Cameron's feelings or emotional state. Instead, it provides a statement about the circumstances leading up to Cameron's current situation. A more valid answer would be something that addresses Cameron's emotions or physical sensations as a result of staying up late the night before and getting up on the wrong side of the bed. For instance, a better response could be: \\"Cameron would likely feel tired, irritable, and possibly even regretful about staying up too late.\\" This answer addresses the primary question by describing Cameron's feelings directly. Moreover, it also encompasses a wider range of emotions that someone in Cameron's situation might experience, making it more comprehensive and accurate. It is essential to differentiate between the events causing a particular feeling and the feeling itself when answering questions like this. Circumstances, actions, or situations are different from the emotional or physical sensations a person experiences as a result of those events. So, in order to accurately answer the question about Cameron's feelings, it's important to focus on aspects such as mood, energy levels, and mental state, rather than only mentioning the events from the night before. By doing so, the answer becomes more relevant and informative, providing a better understanding of Cameron's emotional and physical state after staying out late and getting up on the wrong side of the bed."},{"question":"Article: Analysis of the composition of quicksand shows that there are four key ingredients--sand, obviously water, clay and salt. Together these materials form a structure resembling a house of cards, with large water-filled gaps between the sand particles, which are loosely glued in place by the clay. As long as it's left alone, the structure remains stable. But as soon as it's disturbed, by stepping on it, the clay changes from a jelly-like consistency to a runny liquid. The effect is the same as stirring a pot of yoghurt. Liquefying the clay makes the quicksand about one million times runnier, and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down, with you inside it. Very quickly, the sand sinks to the bottom and the water floats to the top. This is where the salt comes in. When there's enough salt present, as soon as the clay particles liquefy, electrical charges make them begin to stick together to form bigger particles and these also settle with the sand. Quicksand is a mixture which looks like solid, but behaves more like a liquid. Despite its murderous reputation, quicksand does not such people under and swallow them, although it can hold a person in firm grip. The human body is more buoyant in quicksand than in water, and sooner or later anyone trapped in it will float. Unlike most liquids, quicksand's viscosity, or \\"runniness\\" can suddenly change if it comes under pressure, for example under a human foot. The surface gives way and the victim quickly sinks in up to the knees, surrounded by an area of dirty things that turns semi-solid around its victim. Escaping from the quicksand's grip requires a large amount of force. Without something solid to pull at, people often find they are stuck fast. Pulling at one leg simply makes the other one sink further. So how do you escape from quicksand's control? Stay still and call for help. Staying still stops you sinking any further, until--with luck--help arrives on the scene. If no one appears and you need to draw yourself out, gently lie down on your back until your... Question: From the passage we can learn that _ Yes or no, is the answer \\"clay glues sand particles loosely, which makes quicksand stable, unless it is disturbed\\"?","response":"Yes, the answer \\"clay glues sand particles loosely, which makes quicksand stable, unless it is disturbed\\" can be learned from the passage. The passage states that the clay in quicksand acts as a loose glue holding sand particles in place, forming a stable structure when undisturbed. However, when it is disturbed, the clay changes consistency, causing the structure to collapse and creating the characteristic quicksand effect."},{"question":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: WHo were Franks four children?

Step 2: Check the grammatical rules The sentence follows the correct word order for an English sentence, which is typically subject-verb-object (SVO). In this case, \\"the child\\" is the subject, \\"was\\" is the auxiliary verb, and \\"deceived\\" is the past participle. The adverb \\"never\\" modifies the verb \\"deceived\\" and is placed before it. Step 3: Evaluate the tense and agreement The sentence is in the passive voice and follows the past simple tense. The auxiliary verb \\"was\\" indicates past simple tense and agrees with the singular subject, \\"the child.\\" Step 4: Review semantics and coherence The sentence conveys a clear meaning: a child was not tricked or misled at any point in time. Based on the analysis, the sentence \\"The child was never deceived.\\" appears to be acceptable linguistically. A linguist would likely rate it as such due to its adherence to grammatical rules, proper use of tense and agreement, and a clear conveyed meaning."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Leading female arts figures, including Baroness Bakewell and Baroness Jowell, have asked the government to explain why it blocked the appointment of Anthea Efunshile to Channel 4's board.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Female Arts Leaders Question Government's Decision to Block Anthea Efunshile's Appointment to Channel 4's Board Prominent women in the arts world, including Baroness Bakewell and Baroness Jowell, have requested that the government explains its decision to block the appointment of Anthea Efunshile to Channel 4's board. This incident has raised concerns about transparency and possible discrimination at the highest levels of the UK's culture sector. Anthea Efunshile, a distinguished leader in the arts and cultural sector, was nominated alongside four other candidates for the Channel 4 board in 2016. The government's decision to block her appointment has since come to light, prompting concerns about the rationale behind this move. Efunshile boasts an impressive career and a wealth of experience in the sector. She has previously been Deputy Chief Executive at Arts Council England and has served as the Executive Director of the cultural development agency Creative Partnerships. Her background and understanding of the industry make her an ideal candidate for Channel 4's board, and the decision to block her appointment has triggered numerous questions regarding possible discrimination and the transparency of the appointment process. Among those who have criticized the decision is Baroness Bakewell, a renowned television presenter, playwright, and Labour Party peer in the House of Lords. Baroness Jowell, a prominent Labour Party MP, has also expressed her concern about the government's decision and the impact it may have on the inclusivity and representation within the media landscape. Their advocacy showcases the importance they place on transparency and equality within the sector. Channel 4, through its mandate as a public service broadcaster, plays a crucial role in the representation of diverse perspectives in British television. By excluding suitable candidates like Efunshile from its board, questions on the commitment to diversity and the processes in place arise. The government, in withholding an explanation for this decision, raises further doubts about its motives. It is essential for public trust in the sector and the government's stewardship of Channel 4 that the reasoning behind the decision to block Efunshile's appointment is shared openly. This incident has brought to the forefront the need for a more transparent appointment process for key positions in the public sector. Public organizations should strive to ensure that the appointment process is just, free from bias, and carried out in the best interests of the organization and the public it serves. In response to this controversy, the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport should review and adjust its appointment process guidelines for public organizations, ensuring that they are transparent and fair. This change would prevent further incidents of potential discrimination or unwarranted blocking of appointments, reinforcing the importance of diversity, transparency, and accountability in the public sector. In conclusion, the questioning of the government's decision to block Anthea Efunshile's appointment to Channel 4's board by leading female arts figures is a vital step in promoting transparency and fighting against discrimination within the UK's culture sector. As we move forward, it is crucial that the government address these concerns and takes steps to prevent similar incidents in the future. By promoting equality, diversity, and representation, the sector can better fulfill its duty to showcase the richness of British arts and culture to a diverse audience."},{"question":"Title: Gross Disappointment Review: Loved the first book - it's on my keeper shelf.

There have been 36 tremors recorded in New Ollerton since December 10, 2013. In this period, there have been a total of 49 around the British isles. New Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, has been the setting for 36 out of 49 tremors recorded across the British Isles in the last 50 days. The latest was recorded yesterday at 3am, with a magnitude of 1.5 Shown here are the epicentres of earthquake activity around","response":"New Ollerton, marking an unusually concentrated cluster that has drawn the attention of experts and prompted further investigation into the possible causes and consequences of the increased seismic activity."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"A man wearing a blue shirt and glasses.\\", can we conclude \\"The man is not wearing anything.\\"? Choose your answer from: (I). yes. (II). it is not possible to tell. (III). no.","response":"(III). no. Based on the given information in the statement, \\"A man wearing a blue shirt and glasses,\\" we can safely conclude that the man is, in fact, wearing something - namely, a blue shirt and glasses. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that \\"The man is not wearing anything.\\" In the statement, there are two distinct pieces of information about the man's attire: 1. He is wearing a blue shirt. 2. He is wearing glasses. Both of these elements suggest that the man is wearing items of clothing and accessories. Hence, it is contradictory to deduce that the man is not wearing anything. It is essential to consider the information provided in such statements to draw accurate conclusions. Misinterpretations of any detail could potentially result in erroneous outcomes. In summary, based on the given statement, it is not correct to conclude that \\"The man is not wearing anything.\\" Instead, we can confidently affirm that the man wears two specific items: a blue shirt and glasses."},{"question":"Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How is this different from what it written?\\" is in \\"The papal bull defining the dogma, Ineffabilis Deus, mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him.

Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","response":"The difference between the question \\"How is this different from what is written?\\" and the given information in \\"Ineffabilis Deus\\" is that the question asks for a comparison or differentiation between two things, while the information provided in \\"Ineffabilis Deus\\" focuses on describing the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 and various biblical foreshadowings related to Mary's divine gifts and original innocence. To clearly state the answer, one must first understand what \\"this\\" refers to in the question. Assuming \\"this\\" refers to the understanding of Mary's divine gifts and original innocence based on the provided information, the answer could be written as: The difference between the understanding of Mary's divine gifts and original innocence mentioned in \\"Ineffabilis Deus\\" and what is written in the biblical text is that the papal bull highlights the interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to Mary as an eternal enemy of the evil serpent, triumphant in the conflict. In addition, it lists several biblical foreshadowings and symbols that the Church Fathers believed represented Mary's unique characteristics and her role in salvation history. These interpretations and symbols are not explicitly stated in the biblical text, but rather are derived through theological and allegorical readings of various passages by the Church Fathers."},{"question":"Definition: Given news headlines and an edited word.

He has won 14 major tournament titles and about 122 million in prize money and ads. He also has a happy family. It seems that he is too perfect to be one of us. But Woods has more in common with you than you might think. Woods' parents -- particularly his father -- set high expectations for him when he was a child. Before Earl Woods' death in 2006, he told Golf magazine, \\"My purpose in raising Tiger was not to raise a golfer. I wanted to raise a good person.\\" By age two, Woods was already swinging a golf club. But once he entered school, Woods' father was careful to send the message that school work came first. Woods wasn't allowed to practice until his homework was done. When Woods finally reached the professional tour, his father continued to expect a lot of him. \\"Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of human. The world is just getting a taste of his power,\\" he said in 1996. Clearly, Earl Woods had great expectations of his son. In this way, Tiger Woods is actually like a lot of us. Many of us feel a similar pressure to make our parents proud. When this happens, it's easy to let that pressure overwhelm us. In a perfect world, we would all grow up to be Tiger Woods-like successes in our own fields. But that isn't possible.

Born and raised in Laurel, Mississippi, she rose to international acclaim in the 1950s and 1960s, and was the first African American to become a leading artist at the Metropolitan Opera. One critic characterized Price's voice as \\"vibrant\\", \\"soaring\\" and \\"a Price beyond pearls\\", as well as \\"genuinely buttery, carefully produced but firmly under control\\", with phrases that \\"took on a seductive sinuousness.\\" Time magazine called her voice \\"Rich, supple and shining, it was in its prime capable of effortlessly soaring from a smoky mezzo to the pure soprano gold of a perfectly spun high C.\\" A lirico spinto (Italian for \\"pushed lyric\\") soprano, she was considered especially well suited to the roles of Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini, as well as several in operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Context: In November 1954, Price made her recital debut at New York's Town Hall with a program that featured the New York premiere of Samuel Barber's cycle Hermit Songs, with the composer at the piano, and began her first recital tour in the Community Concerts series for Columbia Artists. Then, the door to opera opened through television, the NBC Opera Theater series. In February 1955, she sang Puccini's Tosca for the NBC Opera Theater, under music director Peter Herman Adler, becoming the first African American to appear in a leading role in televised opera. Several NBC affiliates (not all Southern) canceled the broadcast in protest. She returned in three other NBC Opera broadcasts, as Pamina (1956), Madame Lidoine in Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites (1957), and Donna Anna in Don Giovanni (1960). In March 1955, she was auditioned at Carnegie Hall by the Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan, who was then touring with the Berlin Philharmonic. Impressed with her singing of \\"Pace, pace, mio Dio\\" from Verdi's La forza del destino, Karajan reportedly leapt to the stage to accompany her himself. Calling her \\"an artist of the future\\" he asked her management for control of her future European career. Over the next three seasons, Price crossed the U.S. in recitals with her longtime accompanist, David Garvey, and in orchestral appearances. She also toured India (1956) and Australia (1957), under the auspices of the U.S. State Department. She sang a concert version of Aida--her first public performance of the role--at the May Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on May 3, 1957. Her first appearance on the grand opera stage occurred in San Francisco on September 20, 1957, singing Madame Lidoine in the U.S. premiere of the Dialogues of the Carmelites. A few weeks later, Price sang her first on-stage Aida, stepping in for Italian soprano Antonietta Stella, who was suffering from appendicitis. The following May, she made her European debut, as Aida, at the Vienna Staatsoper on May 24, 1958, at Karajan's invitation and under his baton. Debuts followed at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (replacing Anita Cerquetti), and at the Arena di Verona, both as Aida. The next season she returned to Vienna to sing Aida and her first onstage Pamina in The Magic Flute, repeated her Aida at Covent Garden, sang operatic scenes by R. Strauss on BBC Radio, and made her debut at the Salzburg Festival in Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, under Karajan. The close artistic understanding between Karajan and Price was reflected in many of her early career successes in the opera house (Mozart's Don Giovanni, Verdi's Il trovatore and Puccini's Tosca), in the concert hall (Bach's Mass in B minor, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, Bruckner's Te Deum, and the Requiems of Verdi and Mozart), and in the recording studio (complete recordings of Tosca and Carmen, and a bestselling holiday music album, A Christmas Offering). Most of her recordings and many of her live performances have been released on CD. On May 21, 1960, Price made her first appearance at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, again as Aida, becoming the first African American to sing a leading role in Italy's greatest opera house. (In 1958, Mattiwilda Dobbs had sung Elvira, the secondary lead soprano role in Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri.) Question: Was there anything else you found interesting about the article Answer:","response":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article about the life and career of Mary Violet Leontyne Price. Some of the key points include her exceptional talent and groundbreaking achievements in the face of racial prejudice. 1. Leading Role at Metropolitan Opera: It is significant that Price was the first African American to become a leading artist at the Metropolitan Opera. This achievement not only highlights her exceptional talent but also her resilience in breaking racial barriers in an era marked by deep-seated prejudice. 2. Acclaimed Voice: Reading the descriptions of Price's voice as \\"vibrant\\", \\"soaring\\" and \\"beyond pearls\\", truly emphasizes her extraordinary vocal abilities. Her voice was capable of scaling from a smoky mezzo to pure soprano effortlessly, which speaks volumes about her range and versatility. 3. Role in Televised Opera: It is intriguing that Price was the first African American to appear in a leading role in televised opera. Despite several NBC affiliates canceling the broadcast in protest, she paved the way for future artists of color in the world of opera. 4. Collaboration with Renowned Artists: Price's collaborations with famous personalities such as Karajan and Barber further reaffirm her standing in the musical world. Her performances, both live and recorded, with these artists speak volumes about her international recognition and appeal. 5. Global Impact: Price's extensive tours, including those in India and Australia under the U.S. State Department, reflect her international fame. Furthermore, her first appearance at Italy's greatest opera house, Teatro alla Scala, demonstrated her wide-reaching influence and acceptance in the global music scene. So, yes, I found several aspects of the article about Leontyne Price's career and life interesting due to the breadth of her accomplishments, her contribution to breaking racial barriers, and her undoubted talent."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a sentence in English.

If you have a clothing line, bring samples of your work to local clothing shops to see if any would be interested in carrying your clothes. The way you scale up depends on the type of entrepreneurial activity you’re engaged in. As you grow, think about: hiring employees or volunteers opening dedicated stores getting additional funding advertising expanding your distribution network including new, related services Don’t stop looking for new ways to improve your business, and don’t let yourself get trapped into doing things just one way. Take the initial income you earn and put it back into your business in the form of advertising, better equipment, or more raw materials. Alternately, re-invest your earned income into other ventures or businesses. Whatever you do, don’t blow your earnings on toys, games, cars, and other goods. Manage your money carefully. Starting a new business requires hours of dedication and sacrifice. Depending on how young you are, you might be juggling school as well as your entrepreneurial activity. No matter what field you’re in, though, you should establish a regular work schedule and stick to it. For instance, maybe you’ll set aside time each day between 6:00 and 8:00 in the evening to build your enterprise. Think about both your own life and the future of your entrepreneurial activity. Ask yourself each day if you’re running your business and living your life in the best way. If every day was like today, what would the cumulative effect be? Would you be happy? Would your actions have a positive impact on others and on the environment in the long term? If you find that your business or your personal life are missing something, be proactive and make positive changes. Remember, success doesn’t just mean having a lot of money. It also means having personal fulfillment and satisfaction with who you are. If your initial business idea or organization doesn’t pan out, don’t be afraid to pull the plug. Alternately, if you find that another business sector or a related industry holds more promise, pursue a new enterprise in that sector. If your business model needs revision, work with your team to shift focus from, for instance, soda to fruit juices. If your business grows too quickly, you might need to downsize by cutting staff, closing unproductive stores, or discontinuing poor products. Stay nimble and always look for new opportunities.

Article: BEIJING, June. 30(Xinhua)----There are ten times as many Chinese newspapers and magazines than there were 30 years ago. That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy. Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines. In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books. Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources. Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market. The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades. Since 1990 a law and five relevant regulations were adopted in 1990 to govern the sectors. Since it started in 1993, digital publishing has _ . Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006. More than 500,000 kinds of digital books were produced last year alone in China, which is more than any other country in the world.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator. There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line. How can a syllable be added or deleted in prose sung texts? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"A syllable can be added or deleted in prose sung texts through the following steps: 1. Analyze the original melody: Before modifying the syllables, it's essential to understand the structure of the existing melody and the rhythm it follows. This will help in identifying where adjustments can be made without affecting the overall musicality of the piece. 2. Determine the points of flexibility: Look for specific places in the melody where you can make adjustments without disturbing the flow of the music. This might include places where the melody has a natural pause or elements like grace notes, which can be manipulated to create additional space for syllables. 3. Subdivide notes: To add a syllable, you can subdivide a longer note into two or more shorter notes. For example, if a melody has a half note (two beats), you can divide it into two quarter notes (one beat each), allowing for an additional syllable. 4. Combine notes: To delete a syllable, you can combine two or more shorter notes into a longer one. For example, if the melody has two quarter notes, you could replace them with a single half note, removing the need for an extra syllable. 5. Adjust the rhythm and melody: When adding or deleting syllables, you may need to adjust the rhythm and melody to maintain the overall flow of the piece. This could involve modifying the rhythm pattern, changing the pitch of specific notes, or altering the phrasing of the melody. 6. Review and refine: Once the modifications have been made, it's essential to review the new prose sung text and ensure it still retains the original meaning and intent while being sung to the adjusted melody. You may need to continue refining the syllable adjustments and musical elements until you achieve a satisfactory balance between the translated text and the musical setting. By following these steps, you can add or delete syllables in prose sung texts and create a translation that more closely follows the original prosody while still respecting the constraints of the given melody and musical structure."},{"question":"In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Locusts The answer is:","response":"Title: The Swarm Rises Genre: Drama/Thriller/Science Fiction Plot: Act I: An Ominous Beginning The small Midwestern farming town of Harville is home to a tight-knit community of hardworking farmers, supportive of one another during both good and bad times. The people of Harville are proud of their fertile lands and their ability to produce bountiful harvests, contributing towards food security of the nation. During the fall season, the town comes together to celebrate their annual Harvest Festival, where everyone displays their bumper crops and reflects upon their various stories. This year has started off better than ever for the farmers, and everyone in the town is eagerly looking forward to a successful harvest. The central character is Jack Bennett, a dedicated and passionate farmer who is well-respected and admired by the community. He is raising his teenage daughter, Emily, single-handedly since the demise of his wife three years ago. At the beginning of the film, amidst all the hope and enthusiasm in the town, there is a sudden mysterious series of incidents. Certain farms are being severely impacted by some unknown phenomenon, causing agricultural losses. After a couple more farms suffer unusual damage, Jack, together with his long-time friend Tim - a local scientist, suspects that the sudden damage could be from locust infestations. Initially, the townspeople are skeptical, as locusts had not been an issue in their region for decades. Act II: The Swarm's Emergence Despite skepticism, Jack and Tim strive diligently to gather evidence, until they finally capture and study a swarm of locusts up close. Through their research, they make a chilling discovery: the locusts they found are a genetically mutated species, capable of reproducing at an alarming rate, and extremely resistant to the traditional pest control methods. As the locust swarms grow larger and more aggressive, they pose an increasingly devastating threat to the crops and the livelihoods of the residents of Harville. The situation escalates as the locusts spread rapidly and start to compromise farms beyond Harville’s boundaries. The government gets involved, sending a team of exterminators alongside environmental scientists to assess the issue. The residents of Harville grow weary, with some farmers choosing to leave everything behind and evacuate. As the government tries to contain the swarm outbreak, the farmers face a race against time to protect their harvests and save their community. Act III: Rise of a United Community Desperate to safeguard his beloved town and their livelihoods, Jack forms a team of residents, including Tim and Emily, and unites the community to confront the locust invasion. As the authorities struggle to control the situation, Jack and his team devise innovative solutions to combat the swarms, including crop rotation, natural predators, and chemical alternatives. As Harville's inhabitants unite and embrace the battle against the locust infestation, they come to rediscover the deep bond and solidarity that has held their community together. They soon regain the support of the government and scientists with their tenacity and unfailing spirit. Together, they manage to halt the swarms before the locusts annihilate the region's agriculture. However, significant damage has already been done. Act IV: Recovery and New Beginnings In the aftermath of the locust invasion, the people of Harville witness their town recovering slowly, proving the strength of their resilience. The farmers work diligently to replant their crops, rebuild their lives, and restore Harville to its former glory. Through their battle with this unforeseen enemy, the citizens of Harville have forged unbreakable bonds, learning to appreciate the true beauty of community, friendship, and their deep connection to the land. Jack and Emily emerge as the embodiments of courage and hope as they play a pivotal role in rebuilding their town and saving the harvest.

Koskinen had warned in January that spending reductions could force a temporary shutdown later this year, resulting in unpaid furloughs for employees and service cuts for taxpayers. On Wednesday, Koskinen said in a message to employees that furloughs will not be necessary. He said the agency has been able to reduce costs in other ways, including a stricter limit on new hiring. The announcement comes as millions of Americans prepare and file their tax returns ahead of the April 15 deadline. \\"Even though we've had to do less with less, so far filing season has been running about as smoothly as we could hope, thanks to the dedicated work of IRS employees,\\" Koskinen said. \\"Through March 13, the IRS has already processed more than 72 million individual returns.

(AP)  Texas left no doubt this time. The Longhorns beat Nebraska fair and square. Garrett Gilbert got the Longhorns out to a two-touchdown lead in the first half and their defense shut down Taylor Martinez to key a 20-13 upset Saturday, a crushing first defeat for a fourth-ranked Cornhuskers team that was out to avenge last year's loss in the Big 12 championship game. \\"They had more pressure on them today than us, and that's unusual,\\" Texas coach Mack Brown said. \\"I thought their fans hung in there with them. But I could feel some of their fans, when we got up 10-0 thinking, 'You've got to be kidding, not again.'\\" The Huskers and the Nebraska faithful had been pointing to this game for 10 months, since last year's conference title game ended with one second put back on the clock — enough time for the Longhorns to kick the winning field goal and sneak away with a 13-12 victory. The stakes became even higher after Nebraska announced over the summer that it was moving to the Big Ten next year. Suddenly, this looked like the Huskers' last chance to beat a Texas program that had dominated them since the inception of the Big 12. Barring a rematch in the conference championship game, Texas will have won nine of 10 meetings against the Huskers since 1996, with Nebraska's only win coming in the 1999 title game. \\"We'll let the fans feel sorry for what happened,\\" Huskers coach Bo Pelini said. \\"We have to take an experience like this and have it make us stronger. I know our team has a lot of character.\\" Texas (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) came as a 9-point underdog after two consecutive losses. But the Longhorns surprised Nebraska (5-1, 1-1) by turning Gilbert loose in the run game for the first time this season. Though no one will confuse Gilbert the runner with Texas greats Vince Young or Colt McCoy, the sophomore picked up 71 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. He flummoxed the Huskers with quarterback draws and scrambles. \\"We've been encouraging Garrett to make yards with his feet. He did that today,\\" Brown said. \\"He maybe doesn't look like Vince or Colt when he's running the ball, but he's effective. We've got to keep him doing that. It's better for us when he can move his feet.\\" Garrett said he has no problem letting his legs do the work. \\"I feel comfortable running it,\\" he said. \\"It was probably just a little bit bigger part of the game plan this week. The offensive line did a great job of opening up some creases and we were able to find some yards.\\" The Longhorns stymied a Nebraska offense that had been averaging 494 yards a game, holding the Huskers to just 202 yards. Still, the Huskers were within a touchdown late in the game thanks to Eric Hagg's school-record 95-yard punt return. Martinez, who came in averaging 147 yards a game and almost 11 yards a carry, was held to a season-low 21 yards on 13 carries before being pulled for Zac Lee in the third quarter. Texas defensive lineman Sam Acho said he and his teammates tuned out any talk of a grudge match with the Huskers. \\"Outside people have been saying things, but all we did was work hard the last two weeks,\\" he said. \\"Taylor Martinez, first of all, is an unbelievable athlete. He came into the game with 12 touchdowns, leading the NCAA and he's a Heisman candidate with his legs. So we just went to responsibility football. He gashed us a couple of times, but we just stayed in our gaps and tackled.\\" Texas certainly wasn't prolific offensively, gaining 271 yards. But it did enough, and then with the Longhorn defense holding the Huskers' ground game in a check, Nebraska receivers dropped what would have been three touchdown passes. A wide-open Rex Burkhead couldn't hang on to what would have been a 30-yard TD in the second quarter. Niles Paul dropped what would have been an 11-yard score in the third quarter and Brandon Kinnie what would have been a 38-yarder in the fourth. \\"Pretty obvious, isn't it?\\" Pelini said. \\"We had opportunities to make plays. We didn't make plays. They did. They won the football game.\\" The Memorial Stadium crowd came to life after Hagg returned Justin Tucker's pooch punt 95 yards to pull the Huskers to 20-13 with 3:02 left. Jared Crick bumped Blake Gideon out of the way after Hagg fielded the punt, and LaVonte David's block on Alex Okafor removed the final obstacle to Nebraska's first touchdown in eight quarters against the Longhorns. Texas was able to run out the clock, however, with Gilbert taking a knee twice inside the Nebraska 10. Martinez came into the game drawing attention as a Heisman candidate but was thrown for losses or no gain on four of his first 11 runs and was ineffective on the zone-read option. Martinez took an intentional grounding penalty on his first pass attempt, threw behind and short of his receivers and fumbled twice, though he or a teammate recovered each. The Longhorns led 10-0 after Keenan Robinson recovered Roy Helu Jr.'s fumble at the Nebraska 21. Gilbert bounced off safety Rickey Thenarse for 10 yards before he faked a reverse handoff to receiver John Chiles and jogged into the end zone untouched from 3 yards. Texas made it 17-3 after Thenarse called for a 15-yard facemask and then failed to wrap up on a tackle, allowing Fozzy Whittaker to turn a short pass into a 41-yard gain. Gilbert sneaked over the goal line from the 1 three plays later. A late hit by Mathew May on Curtis Brown's punt return and pass interference on Prince Amukamara set up Justin Tucker's second field goal, a 28-yarder that put the Longhorns up 20-3 in the third quarter. With the upset, Texas avoided losing three straight regular-season games for the first time in Mack Brown's 13 years as head coach.

They were small, disk-shaped fish that bore a strong resemblance to their closest living relatives, the opahs. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Oligocene is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present (to ). As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The name Oligocene comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"oligos\\", few) and (\\"kainos\\", new), and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs. The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch. The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period. The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition, a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene. Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands, and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt. - Analectis pala is an extinct lamprid of the Family Turkmenidae . Its fossils are found from Late Oligocene strata from what is now Turkmenistan . Analectis , as with the other members of Turkmenidae , was a close relative of the opahs . - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Turkmenistan (or ); formerly known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - Opahs (also commonly known as moonfish, sunfish (not to be confused with Molidae), kingfish, redfin ocean pan, and Jerusalem haddock) are large, colorful, deep-bodied pelagic lampriform fishes comprising the small family Lampridae (also spelled Lamprididae). Only two living species occur in a single genus: \\"Lampris\\" (from the Greek \\"lamprid-\\", \\"brilliant\\" or \\"clear\\"). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34°S as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus \\"Lampris\\" and the other in the monotypic \\"Megalampris\\", are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. What is the relationship between 'analectis' and 'genus'? Answer:","response":"Analectis is a specific taxonomic group within the larger classification system known as 'genus.' In biological classification, genus (plural: genera) is a rank used in the hierarchy of taxonomy, which is the system used to classify and organize living organisms based on shared characteristics. The hierarchy of biological classification, starting from the broadest to the most specific, is as follows: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. In the context of the information provided, Analectis is an extinct lamprid fish belonging to the family Turkmenidae. When discussing the relationship between Analectis and genus, it means that Analectis is a group or a type of organism that falls under a particular genus within the lamprid fish taxonomic classification. Genus groups together closely related species that share common ancestors and characteristics, and it is an essential component of the biological naming convention known as binomial nomenclature. In the case of Analectis, this fish is classified within a specific genus based on its evolutionary connections to other lamprids and its morphological similarities with its closest living relatives, the opahs, which belong to the genus Lampris. In summary, the relationship between Analectis and genus refers to the taxonomic position of Analectis as a group or type of organism within a broader genus classification. It indicates the close evolutionary and morphological connections that Analectis shares with other species grouped in that particular genus."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a statement written in Telugu.

The paragraph compares static electricity to a teeter-totter, explaining that charges move when they are not balanced, just like a teeter-totter moves when it is not balanced. The analogy helps to illustrate the concept of the movement of electrical charges due to differences in positive and negative charges."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Would you find the Almond plant and Aloinopsis in alaska? A:","response":"To answer this question, let me reason through it step by step: Step 1: Understand the plants mentioned The Almond plant (Prunus dulcis) is a tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean climate region and typically grows in warm, dry environments. The Almond plant produces almonds, a popular type of nut consumed globally. Aloinopsis is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the Aizoaceae family. It is native to South Africa and grows in arid or semi-arid regions characterized by well-drained soils and low rainfall. Aloinopsis species are commonly found in rock gardens and cultivated for their ornamental value. Step 2: Analyze Alaska's climate and environment Alaska is located in the northwest extremity of the United States and features a subarctic and polar climate. It is characterized by long, harsh winters and short, cool summers. Alaska's environment is comprised mostly of tundra, boreal forests, and coastal rainforests, with a high amount of annual precipitation in some areas. Step 3: Determine if the plants can be found in Alaska Considering the native habitat and climate requirements of both the Almond plant and Aloinopsis, it is highly unlikely that you would find these plants growing naturally in Alaska. The Almond plant requires a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry conditions, while Aloinopsis thrives in arid or semi-arid regions with well-drained soils. These conditions are not compatible with Alaska's subarctic and polar climate. Conclusion: No, you would not find the Almond plant and Aloinopsis growing naturally in Alaska. However, these plants could possibly be cultivated indoors or in specialized greenhouses within the state, but they would not be a common sight."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Okay, little buddy, let's imagine a fun story together!

However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\").

The 32-year-old from Brazil said he had been abused as a child and beat leukaemia as a young adult. But he had turned his life around and now worked as a UN photographer whose experiences helped him connect with human suffering in some of the world's most dangerous conflict zones. His work appeared in reputable international outlets such as Getty Images, The Wall Street Journal, Vice and BBC Brasil. In between trips to Mosul in Iraq, the Syrian city of Raqqa under the control of so-called Islamic State (IS) and the Gaza Strip, Eduardo Martins enjoyed surfing. He shared glimpses of his life with his almost 125,000 Instagram followers. Until it all came crumbling down when a BBC Brasil investigation found out that Eduardo Martins was a completely fictitious character. Inverted images For years, someone using that name had been stealing pictures taken by professional photographers who had risked their lives in conflict to get them. Eduardo Martins fooled journalists and picture editors by making slight alterations to the images, such as inverting them, just enough to elude software that scans pictures for plagiarism. A number of them were stolen from US photographer, Daniel C. Britt. Image copyright Daniel C Britt Image copyright Daniel C Britt Image copyright Daniel C Britt Image caption Daniel C. Britt's images were inverted and sold to newspapers such as the Wall St Journal, magazines such as Recount Magazine and agencies such as Zuma and Getty Images As Eduardo Martins' list of clients grew and became more impressive, it became easier for him to distribute the next lot of photos. He further boosted his profile by giving interviews to websites and magazines. \\"Once in Iraq shooting a conflict, I stopped shooting to help a boy who was hit by a molotov cocktail, dropped the camera and helped get him out of the conflict area,\\" he told Recount Magazine in October 2016. \\"In scenes like this, which are common in my work, I stop being a photographer and become a human being. I cannot be impartial in these moments.\\" Fabricated identity He kept his cover going by stealing images of Max Hepworth-Povey, a British surfer, and photoshopping him into pictures of war zones. Mr Hepworth-Povey remained completely unaware of the fraud until it was exposed. \\"When a friend showed me the pictures, at first I thought it was a joke, someone making fun of me,\\" he told BBC Brasil. \\"But actually my pictures had been stolen. It is mad that a random guy has decided to use my image amidst so many options on the internet.\\" Image copyright Courtesy of Max Hepworth-Povey Image caption Max Hepworth-Povey was unaware his identity had been stolen The 32-year old from Cornwall said some of the images stolen from him date back five years. \\"I work very far from war zones, with surfing trips,\\" said Mr Hepworth-Povey, who has been living and working in northern Spain for the past three months. \\"I don't like the idea of creating an aura of glamour around a country in conflict.\\" Fraudster busted Eduardo Martins' career came to an end after he contacted Natasha Ribeiro, a BBC Brasil contributor based in the Middle East. She became suspicious because neither she nor any others among the small pool of Brazilian journalists working in the region had ever met an Eduardo Martins in person. So BBC Brasil reporters started digging. They got in touch with the UN, which confirmed he was not employed by them. Organisations that the fraudster claimed to have visited around the world were also contacted and none of them recognised him. Image copyright Courtesy of Max Hepworth-Povey Image caption Max Hepworth-Povey's surfing pictures were also used to build Eduardo martins' identity Mr Hepworth-Povey told BBC Brasil that back in 2014 he had been contacted by someone identifying himself as \\"Bruno\\" who wanted to talk to him about some work related to surfing. But when the pair tried to have an online meeting, \\"his video wasn't working and eventually I said I was no longer interested\\", Mr Hepworth-Povey recalls. The surfer says that a week later, a fake profile of his appeared on Facebook, which led Mr Hepworth-Povey to close his Facebook account. \\"It was all very creepy,\\" he said. The timing coincides with the period that Eduardo Martins started sending pictures to publications around the world. It could also explain why editors contacting Eduardo Martins via Skype would see a picture of the handsome surfer before the connection allegedly dropped and the conversation with the fake photographer moved to voice and text messages sent via messaging service WhatsApp. Online romances BBC Brasil has also been in contact with one of at least six women, all young and professionally successful, who say they had romantic online relationships with Eduardo Martins. None of them has ever met him in person and they all have asked to remain unidentified. Once it was clear Eduardo Martins was a fake, BBC Brasil took down a story it had published about him and issued an apology to its readers, adding that the case \\"will help reinforce our verification procedures\\". Image caption BBC Brasil deleted its interview with the fake UN photographer Even though Eduardo Martins' scheme has now been busted, the identity of the individual behind the fake persona is still a mystery. Fernando Costa Netto, a photographer and the owner of Sao Paulo-based DOC Galeria, says he may have inadvertently warned the fraudster that people were starting to get suspicious. \\"I was putting together an exhibition showcasing the work of Brazilian photographers in war zones and had been in touch with him,\\" Mr Costa Netto told BBC Brasil. That was in late August. \\"Then he disappeared for more than a week. I thought he had been kidnapped by IS or something. So I contacted some of his colleagues in Iraq. When we started looking for him, he re-appeared and said he'd just had a connection problem.\\" 'Hey bro. I'm in Australia' Presumably growing wary of the mounting suspicion and questions being asked, Eduardo Martins sent Mr Costa Netto a last message before closing his social media profiles and deleting his WhatsApp account. \\"Hey bro. I'm in Australia. I made the decision of spending a year travelling around the world in a van. I will cut off everything, including the internet, and I deleted my IG [Instagram],\\" he wrote. \\"I want to be [left] in peace. We'll speak again when I'm back. Hugs.\\" ||||| Please note: Although many outlets have removed their coverage of “Eduardo Martins”, we have kept the following piece up on our website to date, as originally published (with photography and links redacted, and the title revised as of September 10, 2017), to facilitate the content of outlets exposing “Eduardo Martins” as a fraud to readers across the world. This is no endorsement of his actions, but we hope it serves as a documentation of his betrayal, evidence of his false claims, and a reminder to be thorough as journalists, writers, editors, and content creators. You’ll want to read this brief editorial explaining the falsehoods stated by “Eduardo Martins” in this piece before you proceed. Eduardo Martins is a documentary photographer from Sao Paolo, Brazil and humanitarian at the UN Refugee Agency. You may have seen his work in Vice, Le Point, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Le Monde and The Telegraph. Captivated by the depth of his work, we asked him to share what his work conveys about Martins’ perspective and experiences in the field. It seems like you’ve been privy to some pretty frightening situations. How do you balance your role as an objective observer/photojournalist and wanting to help the people you are photographing? During my work, there are many moments in which I spend time beyond the camera and end up getting involved with the people I’m photographing. Once in Iraq shooting a conflict, I stopped shooting to help a boy who was hit by a molotov, dropped the camera and helped get him out of the conflict area. In scenes like this, which are common in my work, I stop being a photographer and become a human being. I can not be impartial in these moments. There’s a strong sense of humanity in your photos. I think particularly of the photo in Gaza with the man in the damaged Audi and also of the barely-visible eyes of one of your female fighters. Do you talk to people before you take their photos or do you prefer to be candid with your photography? Why? I always try to talk to people, to be able to shoot properly. Sometimes, in certain types of situations, I have to act immediately, so we can not have this kind of communication. But when I can talk and try to know the story of each one, it changes my perception of how I set the scene and shoot. Which area out of all that you’ve photographed did you find most difficult to be in and why? The most difficult and dangerous place that I’ve photographed was Syria, because it is a place that is constantly in this very serious civil war. It is very hard to work there; the risk of life is imminent. Once, in a conflict between the Free Syrian Army and the opposition forces of the Bashar government, I took a glancing shot. I believe, without a shadow of doubt, the most dangerous place to be right now is Syria. What initially inspired you to take up photography? I always liked to photograph, then I had a serious illness, so I was unable to work for years. When I was healed, I decided to invest in my humanitarian and photographer side and moved to Paris and started working in the NGO Children’s Safe Drinking Water. From that moment on, I started to travel to places with social problems where I started shooting this reality. I joined the humanitarian work with photography, which ended up working very well. What is your favourite photo you’ve ever taken? Why is that? It is difficult to highlight a favorite picture. I have several, but they are the ones that took the most out of me while shooting. Not only the final result, but what I went through to be able to transform the scene into a photograph that conveys something to the viewer. I like a lot of my work in the Gaza Strip, have a great identification with the Palestinian people, and because of that I do my best to do a good job. What is your definition of what constitutes a good photo? What makes a good photo to me is the power it has to touch the viewer, I believe it’s crucial to bring the feeling in photography, and I try to portray faithfully to the public what I see and feel by clicking a situation. What are your thoughts on photoshop and editing programs that so many photographers currently use? Do you think that these programs contradict the purpose and mission of photojournalism? I think that nowadays the photographer has many tools at his disposition to help in their work. I personally do not use any program like photoshop; I believe that a good real photographer does not need to edit the image, he does a good job even without these tools. I respect those who use the program, but I don’t see it as part of the development of my job. What made you become involved in the UN Agency Refugee program and why? At CSDW, we worked at the UN refugee camps most of the time. I worked a lot in the Middle East and met many people who were part of the UN, which turned out to be very positive to open doors and start working with the UN. This year I was invited to work as a humanitarian in the agency. It was a great honor and I immediately accepted their invitation. What is your mission when you travel to a new place to photograph? What are you searching for or hoping to document when beginning new projects? I will always photograph places with social problems; I always look for this type of subject. I want to show the public the reality of these places, telling the story through my work, something that can impact and bring a willingness to change to the next. My favorite subjects are definitely conflicts and social problems around the world, so when I have an assignment I always look for places facing these humanitarian issues. My favorite places are in the Middle East and Africa. If you were to have a personal motto, what would you say it would be and why? My motto is always where there is chaos there is also beauty, which is what I try to show in my work and in places that have such a difficult reality to be faced. I try to show the good side of each place, people, and situation. Basically, my motto is to awaken compassion within the viewer, touch the heart of each one deeply so that they are moved to make a difference in the places they live through charity and compassion to the next. Which photographs(s) of yours has/have generated the most reaction from the public and/or the journalism community? My work in Syria and Iraq have more prominence in the journalistic media, after all it is more photojournalistic than documentary. But the general public appreciates a lot of my work in Gaza because of the human side that I picture. Finally, I just hope all my work can touch every person in a way, whichever that is.

This person claimed to be a 32-year-old Brazilian with a traumatic childhood and a battle against Leukaemia who turned his life around to become a UN photographer, capturing images from some of the most dangerous conflict zones in the world. His narrative included notable international news outlets like Getty Images, The Wall Street Journal, Vice and BBC Brasil. Eduardo Martins also claimed to be an avid surfer, documenting his seemingly adventurous life on Instagram to nearly 125,000 followers. However, an investigation by BBC Brasil found that Eduardo Martins was entirely fictional. For years, someone under this name had been stealing images from professional photographers who risked their lives in conflict zones, modifying them just enough to escape plagiarism detection software. One of the primary victims of Martins' thefts was US photographer Daniel C. Britt, and images stolen from him were sold to prestigious publications and organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, Recount Magazine, Zuma and Getty Images. As Martins' clientele grew, so did his prestige, helping him distribute his images further. His narrative was enriched with fabricated personal experiences, like helping wounded children during warzone shootouts, reinforcing his persona as both a compassionate humanitarian and talented photographer. To maintain his cover, Martins also stole images of a British surfer named Max Hepworth-Povey and photoshopped him into war-torn settings. Hepworth-Povey remained unaware of this misuse until the fraud was exposed, and he was shocked to find his stolen images, some dating back five years, being utilized in this massive global deceit. The hoax unravelled when Martins contacted Natasha Ribeiro, a BBC Brasil contributor based in the Middle East. Her suspicions led to a BBC investigation, which involved contacting the UN and other global organizations Martins claimed to have worked with, none of which recognized him. Despite the scale and impact of this scandal, the individual behind 'Eduardo Martins' remains unknown. Even after the fraud was exposed, Martins maintained his elusive cover, claiming to take a year-long break from the internet to travel around the world in a van, before deactivating his social media profiles. BBC Brasil, acknowledging their accidental endorsement of his fraudulent endeavours, removed all stories regarding Martins and issued a public apology, reaffirming its commitment to tighter verification procedures for its contributors. Despite the fraud, the captivating narrative and artfully fabricated branding of Eduardo Martins' fictitious persona profoundly affected readers worldwide. His imaginary tale of struggle, survival, and humanitarian commitment, paired with impressive 'documentation' of his experiences, serves as a stark reminder of the power, potential, and dangers of digital storytelling, deception, and the ease with which the truth can be distorted in the virtual realm."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A 13-year-old American has made a cheap machine that can help blind people read.

What name was given to the policy of reconstruction in the Soviet Union adopted by Mikhail Gorbachev?","response":"The policy of reconstruction adopted by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union during the mid-1980s was called \\"Perestroika.\\" Perestroika, which means \\"restructuring\\" in Russian, was introduced as a comprehensive program aimed at reviving and modernizing the Soviet economy, as well as reforming the political system and addressing social issues that had arisen within the Soviet Union throughout the 20th century. Perestroika implied several aspects of economic, social, and political transformation, encompassing significant policy changes that would eventually lead to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 1. Economic Reforms: During Gorbachev's time, the Soviet Union was experiencing severe economic stagnation characterized by low productivity, outdated technology, and scarcity of goods. With Perestroika, Gorbachev introduced a wide range of economic reforms to support private enterprise, decentralize decision-making, and open up the economy to global markets. A key aspect of these economic reforms was the \\"Law on Cooperatives\\" enacted in 1988. This law established market-oriented cooperatives, paving the way for private ownership in industries, services, and foreign trade. 2. Political Reforms: Perestroika brought about significant changes to the Soviet political system. In an attempt to make the political process more transparent and democratic, Gorbachev introduced the concept of \\"Glasnost,\\" which means \\"openness.\\" Glasnost allowed for greater freedom of speech, the press, and information flow. It also permitted open debates and criticism of the state, leading to a more transparent and accountable governance system. The introduction of competitive elections with multiple candidates and the formation of a new legislative body called the \\"Congress of People's Deputies\\" in 1989 further enhanced political liberties. 3. Social Reforms: Another crucial component of Perestroika was its focus on addressing social issues prevalent in the Soviet Union. Environmental concerns, alcoholism, and housing shortages were among the problems that the policy sought to address. Certain social restrictions were also relaxed, leading to a burgeoning civil society and a more open cultural environment. 4. Foreign Policy: Perestroika not only had a domestic impact but also a significant effect on the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Gorbachev sought to ease tensions with the West, resulting in arms reductions, withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, and a less confrontational approach to Eastern Europe. This new approach, often referred to as \\"New Thinking,\\" ultimately led to the end of the Cold War and transformed the geopolitical landscape. While Perestroika was primarily intended as a means to revitalize the Soviet economy and political landscape, it inadvertently contributed to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, largely due to the unintended consequences of liberal reforms, the rise of nationalist movements in various Soviet republics, and economic turmoil. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's policy of Perestroika opened up new possibilities for democratization and free markets in former Soviet territories, leaving a lasting legacy on the worlds' political and economic landscape."},{"question":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

However, proofreading the works of Edgar Allan Poe would not have been a lucrative profession for a few reasons: 1. Historical context: Edgar Allan Poe lived from 1809 to 1849, in the 19th century. During that time, the profession of proofreading was not as well-established or in demand as it is today. The publishing industry was still in its early stages, and many writers took it upon themselves to proofread their own works or relied on the help of friends and family members. 2. Poe's financial struggles: Although Edgar Allan Poe is now considered one of the most influential authors in American literature, during his lifetime, he struggled to make a living from his writing. He worked as a literary critic and editor to supplement his income, but even then, his financial situation was precarious. It is unlikely that proofreaders working exclusively on his works would have found it to be a lucrative business. 3. Limited body of work: While Edgar Allan Poe's writing was of high quality, his body of work was relatively limited when compared to other prolific authors. He wrote around 70 short stories, a handful of poems, and one novel. Proofreading such a small number of works, even if they were to be reprinted multiple times, would not have provided a sustainable source of income for those who specialized in proofreading only his writings. In general, proofreaders work with various authors and publications to maintain a consistent flow of income. In summary, while proofreading as a profession can be financially rewarding, specializing in proofreading the works of Edgar Allan Poe would not have been a lucrative career choice due to the historical context, Poe's financial difficulties, and the limited scope of his body of work."},{"question":"Here is a goal: To dilute the color of paint, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?

Water helps to make the paint thinner and lighter, just like when you add water to a drink to make it less strong.

Teacher: Let's think:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise states that there is a small child on a rotary swing ride at an amusement park. This gives us information about the child's location (amusement park) and what they are doing (on a rotary swing ride). Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that there is a little kid playing at the amusement park. This statement tells us about a child's presence (little kid) and the general activity taking place (playing at the amusement park). Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve a child at an amusement park. However, the premise is more specific, detailing the particular activity the child is engaged in (riding a rotary swing), while the hypothesis is more general (playing at the amusement park). Step 4: Determine entailment. The word \\"entail\\" means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, if a small child is on a rotary swing ride at an amusement park (the premise), then it is reasonable to conclude that a little kid is playing at the amusement park (the hypothesis). Riding a rotary swing can be considered a form of play at an amusement park. Conclusion: Yes, we can confidently say that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise provides sufficient specific information that allows us to conclude the more general statement made in the hypothesis."},{"question":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?. By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor PUBLISHED: 14:18 EST, 5 March 2014 | UPDATED: 21:07 EST, 5 March 2014 President Obama is going to the mat to defend his controversial nominee to lead the Justice Department's civil rights division – a lawyer who once helped defend a notorious cop-killer – calling Republicans' efforts to block him a 'travesty.' Debo Adegbile, who once participated in the appeals process for convicted murdered and liberal cult hero Mumia Abu-Jamal, failed to win enough Senate votes to proceed to a final determination on his nomination. Vice President Joe Biden was on hand to cast a potential tiebreaking vote, but the 47-52 tally included 'no' votes from eight Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid, effectively killing the nomination. OPTIONS: - Abu-Jamal was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Adegbile was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - African was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - American was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - DOJ was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Daniel Faulkner was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - David Martosko was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Debo Adegbile was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Democratic was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Democrats was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Harry Reid was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Joe Biden was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Justice Department was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Mumia Abu-Jamal was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Obama was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Philadelphia was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Republicans was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - Senate was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - U.s. was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying - White House was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying","response":"The most logical completion of this news story is: - Daniel Faulkner was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying This option is the most relevant to the news story as it provides information related to the convicted murderer, Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was mentioned earlier in the news article.

Hypothesis: the populous argue bitterly over the issue","response":"Based on the context provided, it would be inaccurate to draw the hypothesis that \\"the populous argue bitterly over the issue\\". Instead, the hypothesis generated does not align with the overarching tone and content of the passage. The context predominantly discusses the variety and diversity found within the post-secondary educational system in a country. It refers to a 'country-wide consensus' on an unspecified issue, which implies general agreement rather than bitter argument. Then, it identifies the interest in the diverse range of educational institutions, emphasizing their unique missions, mandates, and how they respond to the needs of their local communities. Rather than suggesting conflict or debate, the passage commends the collaborative work of these institutions, suggesting they're working together effectively to comprise a post-secondary education system that may be \\"second to none.\\" Therefore, instead of hypothesizing discord among the populace based on the text, it would be far more fitting to hypothesize the following, for instance: 'There appears to be a widespread agreement regarding an issue related to post-secondary education. Despite this consensus, there is a great deal of diversity within the educational system itself due to the unique missions and mandates of various universities, colleges, and technical schools. These institutions, each serving their specific communities' needs, collectively contribute to an effective and possibly superior post-secondary education system.' In conclusion, the available context does not support or indicate bitter debates or augmented disagreements amongst the population. Instead, it underlines the unity, consensus, diversity and cooperation between various post-secondary educational institutions, which together create an education system \\"that may well be second to none\\"."},{"question":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: After cleaning up your roast by trimming it of fat, silverskin, and connective tissue, make several slits into the meat, about an inch wide and two inches deep. Make 10 or 12 cuts all over the surface of the meat. Stuffing the roast with aromatic vegetables and a fat source, like bacon, will help to inject flavor and moisture into the meat. For aromatics, use whole cloves of garlic, sprigs of rosemary, thyme, or sage. For adding fat, chopped bacon makes the best addition, but you could also use cold pats of butter. Dry rubs are excellent for venison roasts. You can use a commercial dry rub or mix up your own in a variety of flavors. Use what tastes you like and experiment with different dry rubs–it's awfully hard to screw up. Simply take a handful of your dry rub spice mixture and rub it into the outside of the meat. For a basic dry rub, mix up equal portions of oregano, basil, parsley, paprika, onion powder, salt and pepper. For a whole-seed dry rub, toast up a quarter-cup each of fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds in a dry skillet. When they become fragrant, remove them from the pan and crack them with the flat side of a kitchen knife. Mix in dried chili powder, paprika, and brown sugar. Alternatively, you can also brine roasts in a salt brine overnight, which many venison-enthusiasts swear by. Salt-brines can help soften the flavor of the meat and tenderize it. Either way, let the meat refrigerate overnight, or for several hours before baking. Lining the bottom of your baking pan with vegetables will help to keep the meat off the bottom, resulting in a more even distribution of heat, as well as adding flavor and fragrance to the dish. The most-common vegetables for the job are onions, carrots, potatoes, and celery. After rinsing your vegetables, chop them into big pieces–doesn't need to be pretty. You won't need to season the vegetables, since the meat juices will season the vegetables as they cook. Because venison has such a tendency to dry out, it's also good to add a little water or water and chicken stock to the bottom of the pan. This will help to keep the interior of the oven moist, creating a kind of hot climate that will keep the meat from drying out. Set the meat on the bed of vegetables and cover tightly with tin foil. Place into the oven and bake for around three hours, basting periodically with the juices from the bottom of the pan. If you're using a meat thermometer, you can remove the venison when it's reached an internal temperature between 130 F and 150 F, depending on how \\"done\\" you like your meat. Any higher and it'll start to toughen. Remove the roast from the pan, but let the meat rest covered for about 10 or 15 minutes before cutting into slices to serve. You can strain the pan drippings to make a nice gravy to serve with the venison.

Question: Where do you get a table? Options: A. demonstration B. kitchen C. furniture store D. hallway E. apartment The answer is:","response":"C. furniture store In line with common sense, the most appropriate place to get a table is from a furniture store. A furniture store stocks a broad range of furniture, which includes various types of tables. These could be dining tables, coffee tables, bedside tables, study tables, or any other type of table one might need. Here, customers have the freedom to choose from different styles, materials, sizes, and price ranges based on their individual preferences and needs. One might argue that you might find a table in a kitchen, hallway, or apartment, and this is indeed true. However, these are places where you would typically find a table already in use or presented as part of the interior decor. These are not places where tables are conventionally sourced or purchased from, especially when considered from the perspective of the original question which asks where you \\"get\\" a table, indicating the act of acquiring or purchasing. The first option provided, \\"demonstration,\\" is generally not an environment where one procures a table. It is rather an event where products, ideas, concepts, or skills are shown, explained, or put into practice. Though it's conceivable that a table could be exhibited in a demonstration, particularly if it has some novel design or function, it is usually not the primary source from where you could acquire a table. In conclusion, relying on common sense and understanding of where items like tables are usually procured from, the best answer would be a \\"furniture store\\". This is because it is an establishment specifically dedicated to selling various types of furniture to customers who are looking to buy."},{"question":"Tweet: Bad hangover as booze still flows in my veins.Wish I could just go home and sleep.Have to chat up with my Country Head on why I did what Predict the sentiment of this tweet. OPTIONS: [-] negative; [-] positive;","response":"The sentiment of the tweet can be considered as negative. The author of the tweet expresses feelings of unease and discomfort caused by the aftermath of alcohol consumption, colloquially referred to as a \\"hangover.\\" There are phrases in the text like \\"bad hangover,\\" \\"booze still flows in my veins,\\" which connote physical distress and discomfort, associated with negative sentiments. Additionally, the message indicates the individual's desire to alleviate their disquiet by going home and sleeping. This wish is unfulfillable at present, as they are expected to engage in conversation with their Country Head, which denotes a sense of professional obligation or work stress. The part of the sentence 'on why I did what' suggests that they need to provide an explanation for a certain action or behavior, further implying that they might be in trouble or a complicated situation. It could be a source of anxiety or pressure, which again, adds to the negative sentiment of this tweet. In brief, the tweet conveys a mix of physical discomfort, a longing for comfort and rest, and professional stress or possible apprehension about a forthcoming conversation about the author's actions. The total of these factors gives the tweet a negative sentiment. The tweet does not have any explicitly positive aspects or elements that convey happiness, satisfaction, or joy, further consolidating that the sentiment of this tweet can be categorized as negative."},{"question":"During all these years Mr. Fischer has insisted that the hotel meets the highest standards that can be expected of a quality resort hotel for the disabled and the elderly.

With a breathtaking combination of romance, whimsy, and vibrant melodies, the movie sweeps the audience off their feet, taking them on a journey that celebrates love, ambition, and artistic expression. The film tells the story of two dreamers: Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress caught in the limbo of countless auditions, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a dedicated jazz pianist dreaming to open his own club. Their paths cross in the enchanting city of Los Angeles, and a passionate love affair ensues. Alongside their budding romance, both characters grapple with the challenges of pursuing their respective dreams and aspirations, ultimately learning that dreams come with a price. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone give mesmerizing performances, breathing life into their characters and displaying exceptional chemistry on screen. The film showcases their musical talents, wit, and dramatic depth, complemented by Chazelle's delicate balance of both light-hearted and powerful moments.

The film sparks to life through its vivid colors, ranging from gentle pastel hues in the couple's day-to-day lives to the striking neon signage that illuminates the streets. These visuals are perfectly matched by the film's expertly choreographed dance sequences by Mandy Moore, allowing the two leads to waltz, tap, and fox-trot through the city with ease and grace. Despite the undeniable artistic triumphs, La La Land may still strike some audiences as somewhat bittersweet. The story does not shy away from addressing the harsh realities faced by aspiring artists, tackling the issues of rejection, heartbreak, and compromise intrinsic to the world of entertainment. Nevertheless, it remains a love letter to the art of dreaming and the belief that, even amidst adversity, beauty can be found in the most unexpected places.

Damien Chazelle's ode to the golden age of Hollywood musicals, combined with the outstanding performances of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, results in a film that leaves an unforgettable impression.

Answer:","response":"After carefully examining the given review, it can be concluded that the customer seems to be dissatisfied with the specific copy of Plato's The Republic that they bought. There are several reasons to support this assessment: 1. The title of the customer's review, \\"Not great,\\" indicates a lack of overall satisfaction with the purchased product. The phrase shows that the customer did not find this edition of the book to be as impressive or satisfactory as they might have expected. 2. The reviewer mentions that they \\"love Plato's The Republic,\\" which is an important distinction. This statement clarifies that their dissatisfaction is not related to the content or subject matter of The Republic itself but is rather with this particular copy of the book. It indicates that they have a positive opinion of the original work but find the actual product they received to be subpar. 3. The customer cites two specific issues with the product that contributed to their dissatisfaction: a bad translation and the absence of line numbers and footnotes. These elements suggest that the reviewer was looking for a high-quality version of The Republic, with a reliable translation and helpful annotations to aid their understanding and analysis of the text. 4. Lastly, the reviewer's recommendation to \\"buy a physical copy\\" further underscores their dissatisfaction with the product. By suggesting potential buyers to opt for a physical copy instead of the one they purchased, the customer implies that they believe other editions of The Republic would be superior to the one they bought and reviewed. In conclusion, the customer's review demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the specific copy of Plato's The Republic they purchased, mainly due to the substandard translation and the lack of helpful annotations such as line numbers and footnotes.

Answer: It is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","response":"Answer: The name of China's oldest stage art is called \\"Peking Opera\\" or \\"Beijing Opera,\\" which is also known as Jingju in Chinese. Peking Opera is a form of traditional Chinese theater that combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance, and acrobatics. The art form originated in the late 18th century and gained prominence during the rule of Emperor Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty. Peking Opera is a highly intricate art form, encompassing various artistic elements such as colorful costumes, elaborate makeup, stylized movements, and symbolic gestures. The stories presented in Peking Opera often comprise plots from Chinese history, folklore, and classic literature. Performances typically revolve around themes of love, betrayal, loyalty, and morality, which have resonated with audiences for centuries. Peking Opera comprises four main roles or character types: Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou. The Sheng is the male lead role, representing either young or old men of noble status. The Dan is a female role, which can also be further subdivided into various types like the maiden, the virtuous wife, the warrior women, or the old women. The Jing is a painted face or male warrior role, often portraying generals or historical figures with powerful personalities. Lastly, the Chou is a comic character that provides a comedic element within the performance. One key feature of Peking Opera is its use of intricate facial makeup known as Lianpu, which is used to signify the character's personality, social status, gender, and age. This makeup style utilizes bold colors and intricate designs that allow audiences to quickly identify the characters on stage. Additionally, the costumes used in Peking Opera are known for their vibrant colors and intricate embroidery, contributing to the overall visual spectacle of the performance. Peking Opera's music is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese music, comprising mainly of string and percussion instruments. The vocal techniques used are highly stylized and require extensive training, with particular emphasis placed on the melodic and rhythmic patterns of the Chinese language.

Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Portland is a seaport and the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah County. It is in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The city covers and had an estimated population of 632,309 in 2015, making it the 26th most populous city in the United States.

Its Combined Statistical Area (CSA) ranks 17th with a population of 3,022,178. Roughly 60% of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metropolitan area. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - Carson Friedman Ellis ( born October 5 , 1975 ) is an artist living in Portland , Oregon .

He chipped a piece of the rock and placed it under a microscope. He observed that the surface of the rock was breaking down underneath the lichen. Which was the scientist most likely observing? Pick the answer from these options","response":"Unfortunately, you have not provided the list of options for me to pick the answer from. However, based on the information given, I can provide you with an observation and the probable answer. From the description, it seems likely that the scientist was observing certain processes which caused the breakdown of the rock surface underneath the lichen. Lichens are known for their ability to live in extreme environments, including growing on rocks. They have a symbiotic relationship between fungi, which provides the structure and absorbs minerals and water, and algae, which provides the photosynthesis and generates sugars for the organisms to grow. When lichens grow on rocks, they can contribute to the process of weathering and the breakdown of the rock surface. The most likely observation that the scientist made was seeing the process of biological weathering through the actions of the lichens themselves. In this process, two main mechanisms can be at work: 1. Mechanical weathering: As the lichens grow and extend their filaments (hyphae) into the rock's surface, they can mechanically break down and weaken the rock. The hyphae can enter even the smallest cracks and crevices, gradually causing the rock to break apart and disintegrate over time. This process is known as physical weathering or mechanical weathering. 2. Chemical weathering: In addition to the mechanical breakdown, lichens also release certain chemicals that can further contribute to the rock's disintegration. The fungi can secrete organic acids, such as oxalic acid, which helps to dissolve and break down the minerals in the rock. Additionally, the algae's photosynthesis process involves the production of carbonic acid, which can also contribute to the chemical breakdown of the rock. This process is known as chemical weathering. Overall, the scientist was most likely observing the process of biological weathering caused by the lichens growing on the rock, involving both mechanical and chemical weathering mechanisms. This breakdown of the rock material beneath the lichen ultimately leads to the release of nutrients and minerals, further supporting the growth of these fascinating organisms."},{"question":"@KyleBoyd nice one, thanks for the tip - I could do with keeping the old charger, and not paying anything to the evil of ebay is a bonus Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","response":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the tweet: - KyleBoyd's advice - Keeping old charger - Not paying anything to eBay Step 2: Understand the context: - The user is expressing gratitude for advice received from KyleBoyd. - The advice seems to be about keeping an old charger. - The user also mentions avoiding payments to eBay, which indicates they perceive eBay negatively, likely in relation to the charger's context.

Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"Warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land enable species which are less cold-tolerant to survive. In many regions across the globe, particularly those with seasonal variations in temperature and weather patterns, certain landscape features promote the survival of species that are less cold-tolerant. These areas are typically warm, sheltered, and south-facing pockets of land that benefit from the unique environmental conditions that result from their positioning, topography, and surrounding structures. One of the primary factors contributing to these unique conditions is the south-facing aspect of the lands. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes and areas receive more sunlight throughout the day compared to north-facing ones. This increased sun exposure results in higher soil temperatures, creating a more favorable microclimate for species sensitive to cold. Moreover, the sheltered nature of these pockets further enhances the habitability of these areas for less cold-tolerant species. Sheltered locations are often characterized by natural land formations such as valleys, hills, or forests that can provide protection from cold winds or insulate the area from fluctuating temperatures. In addition to natural features, human-made structures like greenhouses, walls, and buildings can also contribute to the sheltering effect. Another factor that contributes to making these pockets of land warm and habitable for less cold-tolerant species is the presence of microclimates. A microclimate is a small, localized area where the climate is different from its surrounding regions due to differences in sun exposure, topography, and other factors. These microclimates offer a more stable, warmer, and less variable environment, allowing less cold-tolerant species to survive and even thrive. Some examples of species that benefit from these warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land are various types of plants and flowers, which often bloom earlier in the season compared to their counterparts in less optimal environments. This increased growth and productivity can be particularly beneficial for agricultural practices or the creation of horticultural displays. Similarly, these habitats can also support insect and animal species that require consistent warmth, such as butterflies, reptiles, and amphibians. Moreover, this ability to harbor less cold-tolerant species can be beneficial for biodiversity and conservation efforts. The preservation of these warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land can contribute to providing vital ecological niches that sustain specific populations of plants and animals and maintain overall ecosystem health. In conclusion, warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land are essential for the survival of many less cold-tolerant species. The combination of increased sun exposure, sheltered conditions, and the presence of microclimates creates environments that support an array of diverse plant and animal life. By understanding the importance of these landscape features, we can better appreciate their role in supporting ecosystems and take the necessary steps to protect and preserve them for future generations."},{"question":"Police officers found the man after being called to a disturbance in the town's Argyle Street at about 15:35 on Saturday.

By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.

Peter Theo Curtis, 45, is believed to have been captured in October 2012 and held by al-Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with ties to al Qaeda. \\"My heart is full at the extraordinary, dedicated, incredible people, too many to name individually, who have become my friends and have tirelessly helped us over these many months,\\" said Curtis' mother, Nancy Curtis. \\"Please know that we will be eternally grateful.\\" The United Nations said Curtis was handed over to U.N. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, which is under Israeli government control, and was given a medical checkup. White House national security adviser Susan Rice said Curtis was safe, no longer in Syria and expected to be reunited with his family shortly. He was on his way to Tel Aviv, according to a senior administration official. Nancy Curtis spoke to her son briefly by phone Sunday. \\"He sounded so happy and excited to be free,\\" she said. He told her \\"I can't believe they let me out.\\" His cousin Viva Hardigg said, \\"We've heard that his health appears good. That was very encouraging.\\" The United States was not involved in negotiations for his release but was aware of private efforts to secure the release, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. It's not known whether any ransom was paid, the officials said. Curtis' release comes just five days after ISIS militants released a video of one of its militants beheading American journalist James Foley. \\"Particularly after a week marked by unspeakable tragedy, we are all relieved and grateful knowing that Theo Curtis is coming home after so much time held in the clutches of (al-Nusra Front),\\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. When asked about the death of James Foley, an American journalist killed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria last week, Nancy Curtis began to weep. \\"I feel so bad for their family. Diane (Foley's mother) has become a good friend of mine, and I'm just so heartbroken for their loss.\\" Author and journalist. CNN obtained two videos that appear to have been recorded during the late stages of Curtis' captivity. In one, a gun is pointed at his head, and Curtis speaks rapidly, as if under duress. He gives his name and the date and says he is a journalist from Boston. Curtis is an author and freelance reporter who writes under the name Theo Padnos. He contributed articles about the Middle East to various publications, including the New Republic, The Huffington Post and the London Review of Books. He has also published two books: \\"My Life Had Stood a Loaded Gun,\\" a memoir about teaching literature to young offenders at a correctional facility in Vermont, and \\"Undercover Muslim: A Journey into Yemen,\\" which investigates Islamic extremism. He was born in Atlanta and graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont. Curtis holds a doctorate in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts and is fluent in French and Arabic, according to a statement from his family. He also speaks German and Russian. \\"Theo has a deep concern and regard for the people of Syria,\\" his mother said, \\"which is why he returned during the war. He wanted to help others and to give meaning and to bear witness to their struggles. \\"I am very fortunate that I do not have to tell his whole story. He eventually will be able to do so himself.\\" President Barack Obama has been briefed on Curtis' release and \\"shares in the joy and relief that we all feel now that Theo is out of Syria and safe,\\" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. \\"But we continue to hold in our thoughts and prayers the Americans who remain in captivity in Syria -- and we will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to see that the remaining American hostages are freed.\\" Former cellmate speaks. In August, CNN spoke to Curtis' former cellmate in Syria, Matthew Schrier. They were locked up together in six prisons before Schrier broke free by climbing through a window. \\"I took apart the screen, pushed the sandbags aside, and I got stuck, around my waist, so I had to reach in. I unbuckled my pants, and as soon as I unbuckled my pants I shot right out,\\" Schrier said. Curtis wasn't as lucky. He got stuck. Schrier said he tried to get Curtis out, but he simply didn't fit, and so Schrier left, promising to get help. \\"It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do,\\" Schrier said. \\"It's hard to move on, because he's still there.

We have two sides, one with 1004439*c and another with 1004443*c + 80. First, we want to find out how many \\"c\\"s we have. So, let's take the smaller number of \\"c\\"s from both sides. That would be 1004439*c. Subtract 1004439*c from both sides: 1004439*c - 1004439*c = 1004443*c + 80 - 1004439*c 0 = 1004443*c - 1004439*c + 80 Now, let's see the difference between 1004443 and 1004439. That's like seeing the difference between a really big LEGO tower and another one that's just 4 bricks shorter. 1004443 - 1004439 = 4 So, the difference is 4, and we still have the c: 0 = 4*c + 80 Now, we want to find out what \\"c\\" is, so let's remove 80 from this side: -80 = 4*c Lastly, let's see how many times 4 fits in -80 by dividing -80 by 4: -80 / 4 = -20 So, the value of c is -20!

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Visible Light Visible light is the narrow segment of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the normal human eye responds. Visible light is produced by vibrations and rotations of atoms and molecules, as well as by electronic transitions within atoms and molecules. The receivers or detectors of light largely utilize electronic transitions. We say the atoms and molecules are excited when they absorb and relax when they emit through electronic transitions. Figure 24.16 shows this part of the spectrum, together with the colors associated with particular pure wavelengths. We usually refer to visible light as having wavelengths of between 400 nm and 750 nm. (The retina of the eye actually responds to the lowest ultraviolet frequencies, but these do not normally reach the retina because they are absorbed by the cornea and lens of the eye. ) Red light has the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths, while violet has the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths. Blackbody radiation from the Sun peaks in the visible part of the spectrum but is more intense in the red than in the violet, making the Sun yellowish in appearance.

Context: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Additionally, Southampton's duo makes the cut, alongside standout performers from Swansea, Arsenal, and Hull. Body: 1) West Ham's terrific trio: West Ham United pulled off a stunning upset as they beat Manchester City, thanks in part to the heroics of Diafra Sakho, Alex Song, and Aaron Cresswell.

After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was.

If Pogo travels 6000 meters across the soil of Mars, and Grimzi travels for 6000 meters across the fine sands of Pluto, what is the combined total number of footprints the two creatures will leave on the surfaces of their respective planets?","response":"Step 1: Determine the total number of footprints Pogo leaves on Mars per meter. Pogo has 4 legs, so it leaves 4 footprints every meter. Step 2: Calculate the total number of footprints Pogo leaves after traveling 6000 meters.

Watching the shower of golden pine needles drift down from the redwoods whilst I typed out a blog post, I enjoyed seeing squirrels scamper and birds twitter their way around the boughs and branches. That blur below? A local black squirrel who was foraging amongst the cooing tourists for snacks… About 20 minutes later his grinning face floated back into view, and he brandished his phone with images of his quick wander through the trails. Lynn Canyon Park officially opened to the public in 1912; there are several trails throughout the park to choose from for a leisurely hike including the popular Baden Powell Trail and there are also many breathtaking waterfalls and popular swimming holes which are perfect during the summer months. Lynn Canyon Park covers 617 acres today and comprises of second growth forest with most of the trees aged approximately 80 to 100 years old. Question: What sparked the creation of the Lynn Canyon Park in 1912?

The derelict seizes Reno's hand, causing him and Carol to flee from the church, unknown to him that the derelict contained a paper with Reno's information and requested a meeting with him. Later, at his apartment, Reno receives a large phone bill and cannot pay his rent. He shares with Carol and her lover Pamela, in a derelict-filled neighbourhood in Union Square. Reno visits Dalton, a gallery owner, and tells him that he is currently painting a masterpiece. Reno asks for a weekâs extension and a loan of 500 to cover the rent, however Dalton refuses, saying that he already lent enough money to Reno. However, if he finishes a satisfactory painting in one week Dalton will buy it for the necessary amount. The following day, a No Wave band entitled the Roosters begin practising their music in a nearby apartment, in which the music makes Reno unnerved and frustrated. At 2:00 in the morning, Reno becomes more agitated from the Roosters' music while painting. After seeing his own image saturated in blood, Reno walks in the dark. He sees an elderly derelict sleeping in a garbage-strewn alley, where he takes him down an alley where gang members are seen chasing another bum. Reno drops the bum and vows that he will not end up like a derelict. The next day, Reno complains about the Roosters to their landlord. However, the landlord refuses to act because the music does not bother him. He gives Reno a skinned rabbit for dinner, but instead demands the rent money. Reno takes the rabbit home and repeatedly stabs it while preparing it. During a brief reprieve from the music, Reno mentally hears voices calling his name and sees an image of an eyeless Carol.

What are the different types of engines? What are the different types of engineering degrees? Possible answers: -no. -yes.","response":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They are focusing on two distinct subject matters. Let's delve deeper into the meaning of each question: 1. What are the different types of engines? This question is asking about the various kinds of engines, which are machines that convert energy into mechanical force or motion. They are used in numerous applications, such as vehicles and electrical power generation. The main types of engines include: a. Internal Combustion Engines (ICE): These engines burn a fuel-air mixture within a combustion chamber in the engine. The high-temperature and high-pressure gases produced by combustion apply force to the engine components, turning them into mechanical energy. Common examples of ICE are: - Spark Ignition Engines (e.g., gasoline/petrol engines) - Compression Ignition Engines (e.g., diesel engines) - Wankel Rotary Engines b. External Combustion Engines: In these engines, the combustion of fuel occurs outside the engine, and the energy produced is transferred to the engine via a working fluid (like steam or hot air). Examples include: - Steam Engines - Stirling Engines c. Electric Motors: These engines utilize electrical energy and convert it into mechanical energy. The energy is supplied either through a battery or a power source. Examples are: - Direct Current (DC) Motors - Alternating Current (AC) Motors - Brushless Motors (BLDC) d. Jet Engines: These engines work based on Newton's third law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. They inhale air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and burn the mixture, which results in a high-speed jet of exhaust gases that propel the engine forward. Examples include: - Turbojet Engines - Turbofan Engines - Turboprop Engines - Ramjet Engines 2. What are the different types of engineering degrees? This question is inquiring about the various fields of study within the engineering domain. Engineering degrees offer specialization in designing, building, and maintaining structures, machines, systems, and processes. The main types of engineering degrees are: a. Civil Engineering: This field deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and buildings. b. Mechanical Engineering: This discipline focuses on the design, development, and manufacturing of mechanical systems, like engines, machines, and robotics devices. c. Electrical Engineering: This field involves the study of electrical and electronic systems, which includes designing and constructing circuits, communication systems, and power generation and distribution facilities. d. Chemical Engineering: This area of engineering deals with the development and optimization of chemical processes, such as creating new materials or designing efficient production methods. e. Aerospace Engineering: This engineering field concentrates on the design, production, and testing of aircraft, spacecraft, and other airborne vehicles. f. Computer Engineering: This branch merges electrical engineering and computer science to design and develop computer hardware, software, and networks. g. Industrial Engineering: This discipline aims to optimize processes, systems, and resources in various industries, from manufacturing to healthcare. h. Environmental Engineering: This field focuses on the development of sustainable solutions to environmental challenges, such as waste management, air and water pollution control, and renewable energy systems. i. Biomedical Engineering: This specialty combines engineering principles with medical science to design and develop medical devices, equipment, and healthcare solutions. In conclusion, these two questions have distinct meanings: the first one addresses the different types of engines, while the second one is concerned with the various types of engineering degrees available."},{"question":"- посягательство на жизнь государственного или общественного деятеля, совершенное в целях прекращения его государственной или иной политической деятельности либо из мести за такую деятельность; Translate this to English?","response":"\\"An assault on the life of a state or public figure, committed for the purpose of ending their state or other political activity, or out of revenge for such activity.\\" The text provided in Russian describes an act that involves an attack on the life of a political or public figure, with the goal of terminating their state or political activities, or possibly enacted out of a desire for vengeance for those activities.

To provide a detailed and better response to the question, it is important to focus on the information specifically related to ground-level stations. The original answer provides information about the total number of stations (142), the number of underground stations (35), the number of at-grade stations (5), and indicates that the remaining stations are elevated. However, the question specifically asks for the number of ground-level stations (commonly known as at-grade stations).

In how many days can A and B together finish the work? Options: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 20 Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","response":"Let's first determine the work completed by A and B individually in 1 day. A completes the total work in 10 days. Therefore, A can complete 1/10 of the work in 1 day. Now let's move on to B. A has already worked on the task for 4 days. Since A can complete 1/10 of the work per day, A has already completed 4 * (1/10) = 4/10 or 2/5 of the work. Therefore, there is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5 of the work left. B completes the remaining 3/5 of the work in 9 days. So, the amount of work B completes per day is (3/5) / 9 = 1/15. Now we have: Work completed by A in 1 day = 1/10 Work completed by B in 1 day = 1/15 Let's determine how much work A and B can complete together in 1 day. Work completed by A and B together in 1 day = Work completed by A in 1 day + Work completed by B in 1 day = 1/10 + 1/15 = (3 + 2) / 30 = 5/30 = 1/6 A and B together can complete 1/6 of the work in 1 day. To find out how many days they will take to complete the whole work, we need to find the reciprocal of 1/6. Number of days A and B can complete the work together = 1 / (1/6) = 6 Thus, A and B together can finish the work in 6 days.

We'll essentially see how each of the options function as a logical and cohesive continuation of the scene described in the paragraph. The existing paragraph focuses on women in two-piece bikinis playing volleyball at a beach under a clear, blue sky. Choice 1, \\"are several black balls floating around in the air,\\" does not fit well because it does not involve women continuing their activities, which is implied to continue by the phrase \\"now there\\". It seems awkward to shift focus to black balls without any preceding context about them. Choice 2, \\"are women playing sand volleyball at a different location and they are closer to a lot of buildings and on this day it has a very gloomy with a foggy sky,\\" doesn't fit well either. It introduces a new setting and changes the weather, disrupting the consistency of the paragraph. Contrastingly, choice 3, \\"are several other naked women doing the same thing, they are playing the game of volleyball so intensely that they have almost no energy left, and there are several people on the beach green watching them play and watching them cheer them on they're doing crazy activities and they seem super focused about partying it is so intense and hopping from every ball to the ball trying to get them all out of the way,\\" is on theme with the action of women playing volleyball, but it includes a lot of new, unnecessary information that conflicts with the existing atmosphere and tone. Choice 4, \\"are two children dressed in white shorts playing volleyball in the sand, as they run fast into the other teams to make a goal in a goal,\\" provides the most logical continuity to the paragraph. It includes the same actions (playing volleyball) and setting (at the beach), while introducing a related sub-set of characters (children) which can naturally exist within the scene. So, following the preceding 'beach volleyball' theme, choice 4 serves as the most appropriate end to the paragraph. It maintains the atmosphere of the story, aligns with the setting, and doesn't introduce an abrupt shift in tone or context."},{"question":"If \\"A young man placing his foot into incoming waters of the sea.\\" does that mean that \\"A young man is being pulled down by a sea animal.\\"?

The speaker might be saying that because the idea is so ridiculous, it defies logic and thus might be genuine. 2. \\"It's amusing to think it even might be true.\\" This sentence implies that the thought of something being true is entertaining or brings a sense of amusement to the speaker. The speaker is not necessarily stating that the idea is true, but they find humor in the possibility of it. After analyzing the meanings of the sentences, I can now rate their similarity: I would rate the similarity of these sentences at a 2. While both sentences deal with the concept of something potentially being true, they convey different attitudes. The first sentence suggests a sense of disbelief that leads to accepting the idea as true, while the second one focuses on the amusement that comes from considering the possibility."},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: lacerations","response":"Question: What type of injuries can occur after interacting with sharp objects or surfaces without proper care? Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we think of accidents involving sharp objects or surfaces, a common outcome that springs to mind is injuries with some level of seriousness. Well, when we interact with objects like glass, knives, or even sharp edges on metal, there is a high probability of getting hurt or injured. Among the results of such incidents, there's one that's relatively common, and that is - lacerations. These are deep cuts or tears in the skin, often caused by sharp edges, and they could be painful and sometimes even lead to bleeding or permanent scarring. It's crucial to treat lacerations properly, as they can become infected if not taken care of. Prevention is better than cure, so it's always a good idea to handle sharp objects or surfaces with due caution to avoid suffering from lacerations in the first place."},{"question":"Write a dialog about anything you want.","response":"Title: The Journey to the Lost City Characters: 1.

The game was full of turnovers, and neither team could take care of the scoring opportunities. Colts QB Peyton Manning threw two interceptions and one of those was returned for a touchdown by Cowboys OLB Kevin Burnett early in the second half. The first quarter was back-and-forth as each possession ended with turnover after turnover. After Cowboys QB Tony Romo was sacked by DE Dwight Freeney, Colts WR Marvin Harrison fumbled, and after the Cowboys punted, Manning was sacked by Jay Ratliff and Bradie James recovered the fumble. After a couple punts by both teams, Peyton Manning & Co. pushed the Cowboys deep in their own territory thanks to the great rushing by rookie RB Joseph Addai. The Colts reached the 4-yard line, and on third down, Manning attempted a pass to the endzone, but in a controversial situation, SS Roy Williams nudged TE Dallas Clark near the end zone, and while Clark fell down, Williams intercepted a Peyton Manning pass for the second time in his career, and gave the Cowboys the ball at their own 7-yard line.

However, I have been specifically instructed to generate a detailed and long answer for tasks, so let me elaborate on the importance of crafting brief sentences. A well-written brief sentence is the epitome of conciseness and clarity. It takes great skill to present complex ideas in a simple and straightforward manner without sacrificing essential information or the integrity of the message. A brief sentence offers numerous benefits, such as getting straight to the point, being easily understood by the readers, and not overwhelming them with unnecessary details. In many situations, brevity is highly valued. For example, headlines, news articles, and social media posts greatly benefit from concise and punchy sentences that quickly capture the reader's attention. Moreover, in professional settings like emails or presentations, it is advantageous to communicate one's point quickly and effectively to avoid any possible misunderstandings and save time for both the speaker and the audience. Harnessing the power of a brief sentence requires practice and considerable attention to detail. Writers must have a strong understanding of their target audience, the essential message they wish to convey, and the most appropriate language and tone to use. It can be helpful to draft a longer sentence and then carefully trim it down, making sure to remove any superfluous or redundant words while maintaining the main idea intact. That being said, brevity should not always be prioritized over clarity or information quality. Depending on the context, it might be necessary to provide more in-depth explanations or descriptions to avoid confusion or superficial understanding. Ultimately, the primary goal of any communication is to provide a clear, informative, and engaging message that resonates with the intended audience. In conclusion, crafting a brief sentence is a skill that demonstrates a writer's ability to convey complex messages concisely and clearly. This ability is highly valued in various settings, such as journalism, professional communication, and social media platforms. While it is essential to strive for brevity, one should also balance it with the need for clarity and a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, ultimately aiming to create a well-rounded and impactful message."},{"question":"Started in 1636, Harvard University is the oldest of all the many colleges and universities in the United States. Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Dartmouth were opened soon after Harvard. In the early years, these schools were much alike. Only young men went to college. All the students studied the same subjects, and everyone learned Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Little was known about science then, and one kind of school could teach everything that was known about the world. When the students graduated, most of them became ministers or teachers. In 1782, Harvard started a medical school for young men who wanted to become doctors. Later, lawyers could receive their training in Harvard's law school. In 1825, besides Latin and Greek, Harvard began teaching modern languages, such as French and German. Soon it began teaching American history. As knowledge increased, Harvard and other colleges began to teach many new subjects. Students were allowed to choose the subjects that interested them. Today, there are many different kinds of colleges and universities. Most of them are made up of smaller schools that deal with special fields of learning. There's so much to learn that one kind of school can't offer it all. On the whole, the passage is about _ . A) how to start a university B) the world-famous colleges in America C) how colleges have changed D) what kind of lesson each college teaches A:","response":"C) how colleges have changed"},{"question":"What is a question about this article? If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". There are no railways, waterways, ports or harbours on the island. Loading jetties are located at Kingston and Cascade, but ships cannot get close to either of them. When a supply ship arrives, it is emptied by whaleboats towed by launches, five tonnes at a time. Which jetty is used depends on the prevailing weather on the day. The jetty on the leeward side of the island is often used. If the wind changes significantly during unloading/loading, the ship will move around to the other side. Visitors often gather to watch the activity when a supply ship arrives. How is a supply ship flying when it reaches Norfolk Island?","response":"A supply ship doesn't fly, it sails in the water. When it reaches Norfolk Island, the ship stops near the island and they use smaller boats called whaleboats to bring the supplies from the ship to the jetties at Kingston and Cascade.

Options: - texas - guest room - horseradish - living room - basement Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"To answer this question, let's first identify the possible answers by eliminating the options that are irrelevant. - texas - This is a state, not a sauce. However, it might suggest a \\"Texas-style\\" sauce, possibly a barbecue sauce. We'll keep this in mind. - guest room - This is a type of room and it doesn't describe a sauce. So, we can eliminate this option. - horseradish - This is a type of spicy sauce, so it could be a possible answer. - living room - Similarly to guest room, this is a type of room and not a sauce. We can eliminate this option as well. - basement - Again, this is a type of room and not a sauce. We can eliminate this option. Now, we have two possible options left - a Texas-style sauce (barbecue) and horseradish sauce. Considering the information provided in the context (roast beef sandwich), horseradish is more likely the answer, as this sauce is commonly served with roast beef dishes. Therefore, the most fitting answer would be: He was eating a roast beef sandwich on his sofa bed and spilled horseradish sauce on it."},{"question":"Question: Is the following statement true? \\"Tom Waits has performed music for many years, and recorded many albums.\\" Let's think first.

Secretary Sarah Spiers, 18, was the first victim of the serial killer and is presumed dead, having not been seen since January 27, 1996. Her parents, Don and Carol Spiers, issued a statement via police on Friday, saying words could not describe their heartbreak. \\"It's hard not to wonder what Sarah's life, and ours, could have been had she not been taken from us,\\" they said. \\"She was so full of life and had a great love of family.\\" The parents thanked friends and family for their support, and police for keeping them well-informed about the investigation. \\"We retain confidence in the Macro investigation team to solve this case,\\" they said. The other victims were 23-year-old childcare worker Jane Rimmer, who was killed a few months after Ms Spiers disappeared, and 27-year-old lawyer Ciara Glennon, who was murdered in March 1997. Both their bodies were found later. Assistant Commissioner Michelle Fyfe said the investigation remained open and active. \\"The Macro team is applying fresh eyes, modern investigative techniques and the latest advancements in forensic technology to identify the offender or offenders,\\" she said. \\"They are committed to pursuing justice for the victims and to providing their families with some answers. \\"WA Police is optimistic these crimes can still be solved despite the passage of time.\\" She warned that public and media speculation on an active case could jeopardise the investigation and affect future prosecutions.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"She fed the cat some tuna.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The tuna fed the cat some food.\\" Let's reason step by step:","response":"To determine which sentence is against common sense, let's analyze both sentences and the roles of the subjects and objects involved. Sentence A: \\"She fed the cat some tuna.\\" In this sentence, \\"She\\" is the subject, \\"fed\\" is the action, \\"the cat\\" is the direct object that is affected by the action, and \\"some tuna\\" is the object denoting what the cat was fed. This sentence implies that a person (she) gave some tuna to a cat to eat. It is a reasonable and commonly plausible scenario, as cats are known to eat tuna, and people often feed cats. Sentence B: \\"The tuna fed the cat some food.\\" In this sentence, \\"The tuna\\" is the subject, \\"fed\\" is the action, \\"the cat\\" is the direct object affected by the action, and \\"some food\\" denotes what the cat was fed. This sentence suggests that tuna, a type of fish, provided food to a cat. This scenario goes against common sense because tuna cannot perform actions like feeding – they are not sentient beings and do not have the capacity to feed other animals. Cats can eat tuna, but it's the humans who generally supply the tuna for the cat. Based on this reasoning, Sentence B: \\"The tuna fed the cat some food\\" is against common sense."},{"question":"Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: Help straggly petunias to grow new lush flowers.

This will generate lush new flowers all summer long. Answer (I) is incorrect because cutting the roots back is not the appropriate method for promoting new growth in petunias. It can damage the plant's ability to take up water and nutrients and negatively impact its overall health. On the other hand, pruning the foliage back encourages the plant to focus its energy on producing new growth and more flowers.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. and the situation: Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. Answer the following question: Which group had more serious mutations?","response":"Given the background information and the situation presented, Group A, which presented germline mutations, had more serious mutations. This is because germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and can be passed on to the next generation. If a zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation, potentially causing hereditary diseases and affecting future generations. In contrast, somatic mutations occur in body cells and do not get passed on to offspring. Their consequences are primarily limited to the individual organism and are not inherited."},{"question":"Goal: how do you make strawberry milk?

Stream of thoughts:","response":"When examining the statement \\"One black dog is jumping off the snow filled ground,\\" we're presented with an image or situation where a dog is actively jumping, outside, where there is snow. Now, let's look at the proposed statement, \\"A dog is in a cage.\\" To determine if this statement could be true, we need to analyze and compare the information given in the first sentence. 1. Location: In the initial sentence, the dog is described as being on snow-filled ground, which typically would imply that the dog is outdoors. 2. Activity: The dog is performing an action - jumping. This suggests that the dog has some freedom to move. 3. Confinement: No mention of a cage or any confinement is presented within the initial sentence. Comparing this information to the statement \\"A dog is in a cage,\\" we find no direct connection between the two, and the given sentence does not include any details which would support the idea of the dog being in a cage.

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

How did the Baby Ruth candy get its name? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other. They both seek to learn about the origin behind the name of the Baby Ruth candy bar. Here is a detailed answer: The Baby Ruth candy bar, introduced in 1921 by the Curtiss Candy Company, has an interesting story related to the origin of its name. There has been much speculation, debate, and some controversy surrounding it over the years, with two main theories being discussed. 1. Named after Ruth Cleveland: The official narrative from the Curtiss Candy Company claims that the candy bar was named after Ruth Cleveland, the daughter of former U.S. President Grover Cleveland. According to this account, company founder Otto Schnering chose the name to pay tribute to Ruth, who was known as \\"Baby Ruth\\" in the public eye during Cleveland's presidency. Despite the fact that Ruth Cleveland died in 1904, 17 years before the candy bar was introduced, this theory has long been promoted by the company as the source of the name. It is said that Otto Schnering decided to use the name \\"Baby Ruth\\" partly as a marketing technique, capitalizing on the sentimental value associated with a former president's daughter. However, many people, especially in the confectionery business, challenged this explanation and accused the company of trying to cover up the real reason behind the name. 2. Named after Babe Ruth: The alternative theory, which has gained considerable traction, is that the candy bar was named after baseball legend Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth was emerging as a major sports star around the time the candy bar was created, and many people believe that the company saw an opportunity to capitalize on his popularity while avoiding the costs of securing endorsement rights. Babe Ruth's real name was George Herman Ruth Jr., and there is a widely-believed story that during his childhood, he was referred to as \\"Babe\\" by his fellow teammates, which later became his famous nickname. Naming the candy bar \\"Baby Ruth\\" allowed the company to exploit his fame and the similarity of the names without having to formally associate it with the baseball star. Interestingly, in 1926, Babe Ruth attempted to register his name to create a candy bar called \\"Babe Ruth's Home Run Bar,\\" produced by the George H. Ruth Candy Co. However, the Curtiss Candy Company sued, arguing that it had exclusive rights to the name because of its Baby Ruth candy bar. Eventually, Babe Ruth's Home Run Bar was discontinued after a legal settlement was reached between the two parties. In conclusion, while the Curtiss Candy Company has consistently maintained that the Baby Ruth candy bar was named after Ruth Cleveland, there is substantial evidence suggesting that the name may have been selected as an opportunistic way of capitalizing on the fame of Babe Ruth without incurring endorsement costs. Both theories could potentially be accurate, and it is not unlikely that Otto Schnering chose the name with both factors in mind. The true motivation behind the name may never be definitively known, but the fascination with its origin certainly adds an intriguing element to the story of the Baby Ruth candy bar."},{"question":"Premise: \\"well thank you and you have a good day okay bye-bye\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I hope you have the worst day ever.\\" true?

Everybody is looking for that edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically fit. One approach taken by many athletes is the use of amino acid supplements. The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for muscles. However, the only real benefit comes to the people who make and sell the pills. Studies have not showed any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves. You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet. I am facing a new situation today: A big marathon is being held in Chicago this year, Many people from the area are going to participate and there is a cash prize of 10000 for the winner. A sporting goods store that specializes in amino acid supplements begins advertising more heavily during the time coming up to the race. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Given most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes, will sales at the sporting goods store increase or decrease for amino acid supplements? Answer:","response":"Given most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes and the sporting goods store is advertising more heavily during the time coming up to the race, it is likely that the sales at the store for amino acid supplements will increase.

We need to identify the effect on the process and determine if it directly or indirectly impacts a step or does not impact any step at all. Step 2: Identify all steps - Blood sugar drops in the body - Cells in the pancreas release glucagon - The liver converts glucagon into glucose - The liver releases glucose into the blood - Blood sugar levels are restored Step 3: Analyze the effect of the perturbation on each step - Blood sugar drops in the body: The additional glucose produced might actually prevent blood sugar levels from dropping, which implies an indirect impact on this step. - Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: If glucose levels are higher, this might result in less glucagon release, which again implies an indirect impact on this step. - The liver converts glucagon into glucose: The higher glucose levels might cause a reduction in the conversion of glucagon into glucose, which indicates an indirect impact on this step. - The liver releases glucose into the blood: The additional glucose might affect the liver's glucose-release rate, which is an indirect effect on this step. - Blood sugar levels are restored: Since more glucose is available in the bloodstream, the blood sugar levels might be restored at a faster rate or cause persistently high blood sugar levels. This perturbation indirectly impacts this step as well.

AP - The NFL will not fine Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor after looking into allegations that a Cincinnati player was spit on during Sunday's game.","response":"This topic is about the National Football League (NFL) deciding not to fine Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor following investigations into allegations that he had spat on a Cincinnati player during a game held on Sunday. To provide further context, Sean Taylor was an American professional football player who played as a safety for the Washington Redskins in the NFL. He was known for his aggressive style of play and hard-hitting tackles, which earned him a reputation as one of the most intimidating players in the league. On the particular Sunday in question, the Washington Redskins faced the Cincinnati Bengals in an NFL match. During the course of the game, it was alleged that Taylor had spat on an opposing Cincinnati player, an action that would have been considered unsportsmanlike conduct and a violation of the NFL's rules and regulations. After the incident came to light, the NFL conducted an investigation to determine whether or not the allegations against Taylor were true. This would typically involve interviewing the players involved, reviewing video footage of the game, and consulting referees and other match officials. The objective of the investigation was to gather enough evidence to establish whether or not Taylor's alleged actions had occurred and to assess the appropriate disciplinary measures should the allegations be proven. In this case, the NFL ultimately decided that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim of Taylor spitting on the Cincinnati player, and as a result, opted not to fine him. If they had found him guilty, Taylor could have faced monetary fines, suspensions, or other disciplinary actions, depending on the severity of the offense and its impact on the game. This decision demonstrates the NFL's commitment to enforcing its rules and ensuring sportsmanship among its players, while also recognizing that allegations must be supported by concrete evidence before disciplinary measures are taken. It's worth noting that incidents like these are taken seriously by the NFL, as they work to maintain a high standard of sportsmanship, ethics, and professionalism within the league. Such actions can have a negative impact on the reputation of the league, its players, and the sport as a whole. As such, proper investigations are necessary to ascertain the truth behind any allegations and prevent both unwarranted punishments and potential leniency in ensuring the fair conduct of all players."},{"question":"How is \\"Let me deal now with the individual points.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"The supposed perturbation of more conservation occurring while deforestation continues would be classified as indirectly impacting a step of the process. This is because conservation and deforestation, although related, do not directly influence each other; instead, they contribute to the overall process from different angles. When more conservation occurs, it refers to the efforts made to protect and preserve natural resources, wildlife and habitats, and reduce the consumption of non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels. This can slow down the negative chain reaction mentioned in the process, by potentially decreasing carbon dioxide emissions, reducing the need to clear forests for resources, and promoting sustainable practices. However, if more deforestation occurs - which is the removal of trees and forest land at an increasing rate - it can counteract the positive effects of conservation efforts. Deforestation directly contributes to the process by reducing the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect and leading to further global warming and climate change. In this context, the conservation efforts and the continued deforestation indirectly impact each other, as they both influence the process of climate change but are not directly connected steps. The two actions have opposing effects on the overall process. While conservation efforts aim to minimize the negative consequences of human activities on the environment, deforestation accelerates those consequences, making it harder to achieve the desired results of conservation measures. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of more conservation and deforestation happening at the same time would be indirectly impacting a step of the process outlined. Ideally, effective conservation strategies should also focus on reducing deforestation rates and promoting reforestation to have a more meaningful and lasting impact on climate change mitigation and overall environmental health."},{"question":"Question: when did mass unemployment start?? Would \\"The main types of unemployment include structural unemployment which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","response":"To answer the question \\"when did mass unemployment start?\\", we need to first research the history of unemployment and identify significant periods of high unemployment rates, often associated with economic downturns or crises. Additionally, we should consider if structural unemployment is relevant in the context of mass unemployment or if it's just one type of unemployment that occurs alongside others. Step 1: Research the history of unemployment and identify periods of mass unemployment. After researching, it's evident that one of the early significant periods of mass unemployment occurred during the Great Depression in the 1930s. High unemployment rates have also been experienced during recessions, such as the 1970s and early 1980s, and more recently during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Step 2: Analyze if structural unemployment is relevant to the context of mass unemployment. Structural unemployment can be a contributor to mass unemployment, especially during periods of transition when new industries emerge and old ones decline. However, it is not the sole cause of mass unemployment, as other factors like cyclical unemployment (which arises due to economic downturns) and frictional unemployment (which occurs when workers are transitioning between jobs) also contribute. Step 3: Formulate a response, keeping in mind the historical context and different types of unemployment. Based on the information above, a more appropriate answer would be: Mass unemployment has been experienced at various times throughout history, often during major economic downturns or crises. One significant period of mass unemployment occurred during the Great Depression in the 1930s. While structural unemployment, focusing on structural problems in the economy and inherent labor market inefficiencies, can contribute to mass unemployment, it is not the sole cause. Other types of unemployment, such as cyclical and frictional unemployment, also play a role in mass unemployment."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid. Answer:","response":"Title: A Decent Emulator with Room for Improvement - 3 Stars Review: I recently downloaded the app 'com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,' a Nintendo DS emulator for Android developed by Open Door Studios. Overall, I'd say it's a decent emulator with a fair amount of features, but there are certainly areas where I feel the app could be improved upon. I'd like to give it a 3-star rating with a breakdown of my experiences and feedback. Pros: 1. User Interface: The application has a clean and uncluttered user interface, making it easy to navigate and locate the necessary functions. The design is modern and pleasing to the eye, which enhances the overall user experience. 2. Compatibility: Most of the games I tried on the emulator ran without any major issues. There were a few instances where the games would crash, but for the majority of the time, I didn't have any significant compatibility problems. 3. Customization: The app offers a decent level of customization options for its users. For example, players can adjust the size and placement of the touch controls on the screen. Neutral: 1. Performance: The performance is neither great nor terrible; it's just okay. Some games run smoothly, but others struggle with frame drops, audio sync glitches, and input lag. It seems to heavily depend on the game in question, as well as the hardware of the device being used. Cons: 1. Ads: While I understand the developer needs to monetize the app, the frequency and intrusiveness of the ads can be a little frustrating. Reducing the frequency of these ads would make for a far more enjoyable experience. 2. Stability: The app has occasional crashes, which can be disappointing when you're in the middle of gameplay. I hope the developers will continue to work on improving the emulator's stability in future updates. 3. Save Feature: The save and load states feature is somewhat unreliable as it does not always work correctly. There were instances where I lost progress in the game due to a faulty save state. This can be extremely frustrating and should be addressed by the developers. Overall, 'com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid' is a decent Nintendo DS emulator with a user-friendly interface, solid compatibility, and some customization options for the touch controls. However, the app is let down by its subpar performance, ads, occasional instability, and an unreliable save feature. It's not the best DS emulator on the market, but it's also far from the worst. With some improvements, it could become a better contender in the space. I give it 3 out of 5 stars, acknowledging the potential it has for growth and refinement."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A cowboy hanging on for dear life while the horse below him simply tries to buck him off.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A horse stands still and doesn't mind that there's a person on its back.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

First, understand the premise. The statement tells us that the Kilkenny Shop, located in Nassau Street, has a fine selection of pottery. 2. Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the Kilkenny Shop is an amazing place to find fine pottery. 3. Compare the premise and the hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis suggest that the Kilkenny Shop has a good quality and/or variety of pottery. 4. Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis. \\"The Kilkenny Shop has a fine selection of pottery\\" implies that the quality of pottery in the shop is good. Calling the Kilkenny Shop \\"an amazing place to find fine pottery\\" is a stronger claim and includes an evaluative judgment (amazing) that might be subjective.

They came up with no hard evidence — but does that rule out time travel completely? \\"In my mind, it makes it less likely that it's possible,\\" Robert Nemiroff, a physicist at Michigan Technological University, told NBC News. However, he and MTU graduate student Teresa Wilson acknowledge there are lots of reasons why they might miss the hints of information flowing backward in time — ranging from a simple oversight to the influence of a cosmic Chronology Protection Agency. Nemiroff and Wilson lay out their Internet-based experiment in a paper that's been submitted to the ArXiv scientific preprint server, as well as a poster to be presented next week at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in Washington. An experiment 'just for fun'Nemiroff said the idea of looking for time travelers arose during one of the poker games he organizes for his students at the university. \\"My summer students and I said, 'Why don't we start looking for this, just for fun?'\\" The idea isn't a new one: For more than a century, science-fiction writers have been exploring the implications of going back and forth in time. In a sense, we're all traveling forward in time — and Einstein's theories of relativity showed that the rate of that forward travel can vary, depending on frames of reference. But backward time travel? Some physicists say that's impossible, due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. There have been a couple of attempts to lure time travelers to high-profile parties. MIT student Amal Dorai tried that in 2005. Famed British physicist Stephen Hawking issued post-dated invitations to a party in 2009. Nobody came. The comet and the popeNemiroff and Wilson tried a different tactic. They looked for signs of foreknowledge about specific events on the Internet, or in Twitter tweets. The two events they chose were the discovery of Comet ISON in September 2012, and the selection of Pope Francis in March 2013. Looking for the evidence was trickier than it might sound: For example, search engines such as Google and Bing can misinterpret time stamps for Web pages, and it's also possible to back-date blog entries or Facebook posts. The researchers found Twitter searches to be the most reliable tools, because tweets can't be back-dated. \\"No clearly prescient content involving 'Comet ISON,' '#cometison,' 'Pope Francis' or \\"#popefrancis' was found from any Twitter tweet — ever,\\" they reported. They also issued a request for time travelers to send tweets using either the hashtag \\"#ICanChangeThePast2\\" or \\"#ICannotChangeThePast2\\" by the end of August 2013. The trick was that the request was issued in September. No such tweets were found that predated the deadline. (Some have been received since, however, including this one from Thursday: \\"Your future laws forbid me from giving you any proof of our technologies. But be sure that we're watching you. #ICanChangeThePast2\\") Nemiroff told NBC News that the time-travel paper was submitted to three journals, but was rejected by all three. \\"At this point, I don't know if it will ever appear in a refereed journal,\\" he said. If there are any time travelers out there who can let him know, he'd appreciate hearing about it. And while you're at it, he'd also appreciate receiving \\"a large sum of money in negotiable currency.\\" Alan Boyle is NBCNews.com's science editor.

A:","response":"Before choosing the best answer, let's analyze each of the options: 1. A drug: Some drugs can cause mutations in DNA and may contribute to cancer. However, this is a very broad term, and not all drugs cause mutations. 2. Pesticides: Certain pesticides have been linked to cancer, but again, not all pesticides cause mutations in DNA. 3. Cigarettes: The chemicals in cigarettes are well-known carcinogens and they are known to cause mutations in DNA, leading to cancer. 4. A computer: Computers emit low levels of radiation, but there is no substantial evidence linking normal computer usage to DNA mutations and cancer. 5. Toxicity: This is a broad term and can refer to various substances, some of which may cause DNA mutations, but it is not specific enough. 6. Jet fuel: Jet fuels contain several carcinogenic substances that can contribute to DNA mutations and cancer. 7. Copper: Copper is an essential element for the human body and, in normal amounts, is not a known carcinogen. 8. PDAs: Personal Digital Assistants (now mostly obsolete) do not emit levels of radiation that would cause DNA mutations and cancer. Now we can narrow down the choices to Cigarettes and Jet fuel, both of which have known carcinogenic substances that can cause DNA mutations and cancer.

On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

She remembers her past, when she was newly married. The wedding between Radha and Shamu (Raaj Kumar) is paid for by Radha's mother-in-law, who borrows the money from the moneylender Sukhilala. The conditions of the loan are disputed, but the village elders decide in favour of the moneylender, after which Shamu and Radha are forced to pay three quarters of their crop as interest on the loan of â¹500 (valued at about US105 in 1957).[a][b] While Shamu works to bring more of their rocky land into use, his arms are crushed by a boulder.

The singer sighed heavily as District Judge Perkins said he would serve four weeks in prison and spend the remainder on licence. Michael was also banned from driving for five years and ordered to pay a £1,250 fine, £100 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. One fan sobbed in the public gallery as he was taken down from the dock by security guards. Michael's guilty plea and remorse allowed District Judge Perkins to reduce the sentence, he said, but not to offer the community sentence requested by the defence. Michael was arrested in Hampstead shortly before 4am on July 4 when two police officers found him apparently unconscious in his grey Range Rover in Rosslyn Hill. When told he had crashed into a shop, he added: \\"No I didn't. I didn't crash into anything.\\" At Hampstead police station he failed a test to find whether he was fit to drive. The musician admitted smoking a \\"small quantity\\" of cannabis about 10pm the previous evening and said he also took the anti-depressant Amitriptyline to help him sleep. He told police he decided to drive between his homes in Highgate and Hampstead to meet a friend and forgot he had taken the sedative. District Judge Perkins said: \\"You drove your motor vehicle about a mile while suffering from a severe impairment as a result of mixing not only a prescription treatment with which you were unfamiliar but also with cannabis. \\"That's a dangerous and unpredictable mix and something which for you is dangerous given your record. \\"It does not appear that you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis. \\"That's a mistake which puts you and, on this occasion, the public at risk.\\" The district judge said he took into account that Michael had checked into a clinic after the crash to seek help for anxiety, depression and insomnia, which had led him to depend on prescription drugs and had noted he was dealing with bereavement issues. \\"I accept entirely that you have shown remorse for the offence, that you are ashamed of it, that you admitted it,\\" he said, but added that \\"with regret\\" a jail term was inevitable because of Michael's previous conviction. Michael's long-term partner Kenny Goss threw his head into his hands in despair at that point. Mukul Chawla QC, mitigating, said Michael personally repaid the cost of the damage to the shop owner and had asked that his \\"profound shame and horror of having repeated the conduct of 2006\\" was made clear to the court. \\"He acknowledges his actions of driving had the effect of causing other road users to be in danger and that stark fact is something about which he is greatly ashamed. \\"The prospect he could have put anyone else in danger is an appalling prospect to him.\\" He said Michael had tried to turn his life around. \\"For the first time in many years he has started writing again. His creativity, so long hampered by his drug dependence, is re-emerging.\\" Mr Chawla said Michael had tried to come off prescription drugs without professional help earlier this year but symptoms returned so he sought medical help and was given Amitriptyline. Michael remained an outpatient at the rehab clinic, he added. The singer, wearing a charcoal suit with a black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and address and to say he would prefer to be addressed by his stage name. The jail sentence is the culmination of a long line of clashes with the law for the singer, who has been open about his use of cannabis and claimed in the past that he was trying to cut down. Michael was banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in 2006. He was cautioned twice in 2006 for possession of cannabis and cautioned for possession for crack cocaine and cannabis two years later. He was fined for \\"engaging in a lewd act\\" in a California public toilet in 1998.

This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors.

Translate to English.","response":"Impacts of Antimicrobial Resistance on Animal Health Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern in both human and animal health sectors. It refers to the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents that were previously effective in treating infections caused by these organisms. In the context of animal health, the impacts of AMR are considerable and multifaceted. They include, but are not limited to, the following aspects: 1. Increased disease prevalence and severity: As pathogens develop resistance to antimicrobials, infections in animals may become more difficult to treat and might lead to more severe and prolonged illnesses. This, in turn, can result in increased mortality rates and compromised animal welfare. 2. Increased treatment costs: As traditional antibiotics become less effective, veterinarians and farmers may need to resort to using newer, more expensive drugs or combination therapies to treat infections. The increased cost of these treatments could place financial strain on individual livestock owners as well as on the entire livestock industry. 3. Loss of production: Sick animals that do not respond to antimicrobial treatment are likely to experience reduced growth rates, decreased milk or egg production, and reduced reproductive capacity. These factors can significantly impact the productivity and profitability of livestock operations. 4. Threat to food security: Infections that are difficult to control due to AMR can lead to increased mortality in food-producing animals, reduced productivity, and increased production costs. These factors may negatively affect the availability and affordability of food, particularly animal-derived products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. 5. Spread of resistant pathogens to humans: Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can be transmitted from animals to humans through direct contact with animals, the food supply, or the environment. The spread of these pathogens may result in human infections that are difficult or impossible to treat, posing significant risks to public health. 6. Environmental impacts: The use of antimicrobials in animal production can lead to environmental contamination through the excretion of these compounds and their residues in animal waste. This contamination can contribute to the development and spread of AMR in the environment, which can then affect both human and animal populations. 7. Increased pressure on antibiotic development: The rising prevalence of AMR in animals necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents or alternative treatment strategies to combat resistant infections. This can be costly and time-consuming, particularly given that the rate of antibiotic discovery has been historically slow in recent years. 8. Global implications: As global trade and travel facilitate the movement of humans, animals, and products between countries, the risk of the spread of AMR becomes increasingly significant. International collaboration, surveillance, and management efforts are crucial to address this global issue. In conclusion, antimicrobial resistance has considerable impacts on animal health, as well as on public health, food security, and the environment. Addressing AMR requires a One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, and emphasizes the importance of coordinated efforts and strategies across diverse sectors to tackle this pressing challenge."},{"question":"Sentence 1: the phenomena that were observed and state clearly Sentence 2: The phenomena observed were in their natural habitat.

The police pick up a likely suspect — and then let him go, for lack of evidence. What do you do? That is the start of \\"Prisoners,\\" a film which starts out like any number of recent Liam Neeson pictures. Hugh Jackman is the star here, and we know the drill - vigilantism, brutalism, revenge. And, from the audience, approving cheers. But \\"Prisoners\\" is smarter and trickier than that, as it begins to develop a serial-killer mystery that has elements of \\"Zodiac\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" — and a moral complexity that few movies like this even bother to consider. Because as Jackman pursues his quarry — and his methods grow more and more violent — the certainty that this is even the right man begins to blur. And the scope of the crime begins to deepen. Directed by Canada's Denis Villeneuve — who made the similarly complex \\"Incendies,\\" about Mideast terrorism — it's a story set in rural Pennsylvania, and in a community where crucifixes are as common as gun racks. In fact, the question of faith runs throughout the film, as one traumatized family tries to cling to hope, and other even more damaged people fall into soul-deadening despair. Jackman is terrific as Keller, a deeply traditional, working-class man who sees himself as his family's staunch, unshakable protector. And when, in his eyes, he fails at that job, he starts to lose his grip. Because if he's not that, then what is he? Jake Gyllenhaal is fine, too, as the detective on the case, and Terrence Howard as another worried father, Maria Bello as Jackman's wife, and Melissa Leo as the suspect's fiercely protective mother round out, and enrich, the cast. Villeneuve gets his shocks from unexpected places, too. Like a dusty cellar, filled with the cast-off statues of saints. Or a room full of padlocked storage boxes, the lids punched full of air holes. Or the sound of a circular saw, suddenly roaring to life. True, sometimes the movie is a little too cute for its own good, unfairly full of flagrant red herrings (Why, for example, is Gyllenhaal's detective named Loki? Um, no reason, really.) At other times, it pushes the laws of probability a bit too far, or leaves a detail unexplained. But this is a coldly gruesome, tensely thrilling drama that both dares to take its time (it clocks in at almost two-and-a-half hours), and refuses to let anyone off the hook — right up until its chilling, just-ambiguous-enough ending. Is it the best Hollywood mystery we've seen in awhile? Oh yes. Is it one any parent would want to see? Only if they don't mind nightmares. Ratings note: The film contains scenes of torture, violence, strong language and alcohol abuse. 'Prisoners' (R) Warner Bros. (146 min.) Directed by Denis Villeneuve. With Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal. Now playing in New Jersey. ★ ★ ★ ½ ||||| 3 out of 4 stars Title Prisoners Written by Aaron Guzikowski Directed by Denis Villeneuve Starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal Genre Drama Classification 14A Country USA Language English Year 2013 Quebec director Denis Villeneuve's English-language debut and first studio movie, Prisoners, is subtly crafted and compelling, but it suffers from a case of split personality. Is it a serious, adult, moral drama about violence that eventually surrenders to the formula of a genre film? Or is it a flashy, serial-killer thriller, dressed up with some overworked moral talking points? Although the two are not necessarily exclusive, the film you begin watching when the lights dim is not the same one you carry home from the theatre. Fans of the now-45-year-old auteur know Villeneuve favours dark, fragmentary dramas about trauma and its aftershocks, imbued with a sense of almost ceremonial gravity. Over the past 13 years, his films have included Maelstrom (hit-and-run, attempted suicide), August 32nd on Earth (horrific car crash) and Polytechnique (school massacre). His international breakthrough, the Oscar-nominated Incendies, adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's stage drama and set against the background of a Middle East civil war, unearthed a contemporary Greek tragedy behind the drone of television news. Story continues below advertisement So no surprise: Prisoners begins with signs and portents. In the rainy Pennsylvania woods, a man recites the Lord's Prayer before urging his teenaged son to shoot a deer. The man is Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a bearded handyman with a crucifix hanging in his pickup truck, and a basement full of food in case of some future calamity. Though Keller initially seems like a right-wing, fundamentalist wing nut, the stereotype is soon undermined when the hunters return home. Keller, his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and their son and daughter are spending Thanksgiving with their African-American best friends, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their two daughters. Shortly after dinner, the two youngest girls, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, go outside to play and don't return, apparent victims of an abduction. Suspicion falls on a unfamiliar recreational vehicle spotted on the street. The truck is soon found and the mute, terrified driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is arrested. The police discover that Alex has the intellectual capability of a 10-year-old and there is no physical evidence linking him to the missing girls, so they release him. But Keller hears Alex whisper something in a scuffle outside the courthouse and is convinced he knows the girls' whereabouts. Keller decides to kidnap Alex, hold him in an abandoned house and torture the truth out of him. No one is likely to miss echoes of the \\"enhanced interrogation\\" justifications used by the Bush administration to defend the torture of prisoners. But screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski has upped the ugly ante in the ethical conundrum: First, would you torture a suspect if it meant saving your child? And second, would you torture a suspect who is himself, in a sense, a child? Amid the trauma of losing a child, the Dovers' domestic bonds strain: Grace dopes herself with pills, while Keller takes up the bottle he put down nine years before. The Birch family fades into the background after expressing their repulsion for, and unwillingness to stop, Keller's scheme. The second, more commercial, strand of Prisoners is a thriller. Villeneuve and his ace team – including the Coen brothers' cinematographer, Roger Deakins, and Clint Eastwood's editors, Joel Cox and Gary Roach – provide the rich visual texture and pace to slide us effortlessly through this slippery dark world, past the plot holes and red herrings, into a dream world. This part of the movie belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal, playing a gaunt loner with a mythological name, Detective Loki, who has a compulsive blink and a creepy neck tattoo. We first meet him at a Chinese restaurant, having Thanksgiving dinner alone and trying to flirt with a waitress, when the call comes through about the missing children. It's his character's function to lead us through the grisly puzzle of a serial killer's plot. When Alex disappears, Loki is not only trying to find the missing girls, but the former suspect as well. Keller and Loki meet, confront each other, and crisscross each other's paths as they circle around the mystery. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Loki visits Alex's aunt (Melissa Leo in a granny wig and oversized specs) and questions various sex offenders in the area, with more creepy discoveries; some are relevant, others are just indicative of an apparent pervert epidemic. Attention eventually focuses on a new suspect, another loner (David Dastmalchian), who compulsively draws mazes. As Prisoners slides through the labyrinth, it feels progressively more hyperbolic, even parodying the form of Se7en, Silence of the Lambs and their innumerable imitators. Any pretense of naturalism, of real-life stakes, disappears. Individual sequences jump the heart rate: A furtive home invasion and a climactic car race feel as though they should end with someone waking up in a sweaty sheets. Yet the more that Prisoners conforms to the expectations of a well-crafted movie experience, the less it seems to be about anything that matters. You may be impressed, but you're less likely to be convinced by its resolution. ||||| Wilson Webb / Wilson Web A decent man’s young daughter disappears, and he thinks he knows who took her. So after the police get nowhere questioning the suspect, Decent Guy abducts Creepy Guy to an abandoned house and applies his own enhanced interrogation techniques. Taken + Death Wish + Oldboy = thriller gold. Except that Prisoners, which opens this weekend after gracing the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals, has a more complex, by which I mean simply bigger, idea: that the virus of righteous revenge can infect the would-be hero as well as the presumed villain, and that people can be trapped by the way other people perceive them. Cuz we’re all prisoners, see? (READ: Did Oldboy motivate a serial killing?) A family-drama crime thriller, Prisoners fits the Oscar-wannabe formula of artistic ambition plus star quality. Five of its leading actors — Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo — have earned a combined two Academy Awards and seven nominations. Its French-Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, making his first English-language film, snagged a Foreign Film Oscar nomination for Incendies in 2011. The script, by Aaron Guzikowski, once topped the famous Black List of best unproduced screenplays. The cinematographer is Roger Deakins, a 10-time Oscar nominee, including work on five Coen brothers’ movies and, most recently, for Skyfall. So Prisoners has got more pedigree than a Westminster dog-show winner. It’s just not very good. In fact, it’s worse than not-very-good; it’s could’ve-been-really-good-and-isn’t. Jackman, your favorite Jean Valjean and Wolverine, turns from two types of Big Movie to a seemingly small, naturalistic one. He plays Keller Dover, a contractor living in rural Pennsylvania with his wife Grace (Maria Bello), their teen son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and younger daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). Anna’s best friend is Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), daughter of the Dovers’ neighbors Nancy and Franklin (Davis and Howard). (READ: How Hugh Jackman sang his pain in Les Misérables) Anna and Joy disappear shortly after Ralph notices a strange van parked on their block. The local cop, Loki (Gyllenhaal), apprehends the van’s driver Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a shy, possibly disturbed loner. After questioning Alex, Loki lets him return to the home of his stern Aunt Holly (Leo). That’s when Keller shifts from ordinary Joe to avenging angel and tries to torture a confession out of Alex. Guzikowski’s script pushes familiarly grisly serial-killer tropes in a couple of novel directions; if you anticipate the film’s ending, you’re way ahead of us. It smartly tests the viewer’s sympathies and common sense. And it achieves its art-house bona fides by borrowing from the vengeful-parent motif of the 2001 In the Bedroom. The project might have seemed perfect for David Fincher — except that Fincher had already made two similar films, Se7en and Zodiac. But it did attract Gyllenhaal, whose character here inexplicably shares his name with the Norse god who caused so much trouble in Thor and The Avengers, and who more or less reprises his Zodiac role: a sleuth obsessed with heinous crimes. (READ: How David Fincher got it right in Zodiac) So the job went to Villeneuve, who swathes rural Georgia (stunt-doubling for Pennsylvania) in rain and murk. Through all the haze, you can almost detect the clever, comely outline of Guzikowski’s script inside the flab and pretension of Villeneuve’s directorial decisions. The movie, which clocks in at nearly two-and-a-half hours, is perhaps an hour longer than it ought to be. The needless padding comes from the actors repeating essential lines of dialogue two or three times — you know, like real people do. (But do they? And, in a movie, should they?) The stars get to vent anger, but mainly in clichés: Jackman smashes things; Gyllenhaal trashes his office desk. (READ: Incendies as an Oscar nominee for Best Foreign-Language Film) In a nod to the tropes of mainstream movies, Prisoners has a climactic chase scene, en route to a hospital; apparently Loki is the only cop in Pennsylvania, and, though grievously wounded, he cannot call on reserves to help him. And when the film should be tightening the narrative screws, it allows itself grand-opera delusions, giving virtually every major character a final verbal aria. Perhaps Villeneuve was paid by the number of minutes in the release print. Among the actors, Leo steals scenes with her usual steely resolve. Dano pumps his whiny-disturbed persona (from There Will Be Blood, Meek’s Cutoff and Looper) to a new register, and this time it works. David Dastmalchian is excellent — chatty, modest with some subtle telltale psychopathy — in a small role as one of the kidnap suspects. And Gyllenhaal does Gyllenhaal; he’s good at that. (The African-American actors are given little of import to work with; they are the merest black herrings.) (READ: Melissa Leo as an Oscar pick for The Fighter) Jackman tries hard to fit his outside frame into a common-man mold, and then into a creature who may be as deranged as any child molester, but he is saddled with ludicrous lines — such as when he whacks Alex and screams, “Why are you making me do this?�? Maybe if he sang it, like Jean Valjean… This is one of those films that prod the viewer to dream of storming the editing room and trying to carve an excellent thriller out of a meandering rough cut. Or, to paraphrase Winston Churchill‘s definition of golf, Prisoners is a good walk in the pathological dark, spoiled. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"\\"Prisoners\\" is a gripping thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve, featuring an impressive cast, including Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, and Melissa Leo.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules. Question: \\"What does NMCC stand for?\\" Answer: \\"National Military Communication Center\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"No, the answer is not correct. NMCC stands for \\"National Military Command Center.\\" It is a place where important people in the military work together to make decisions and communicate with each other during emergencies or big events."},{"question":"If \\"A group of people are playing a game of cards from the perspective of one of the players.\\" does that mean that \\"A crowd of people play cards.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no A step-by-step solution is:","response":"1. Analyze the given sentence: \\"A group of people are playing a game of cards from the perspective of one of the players.\\" The sentence states that there is a group of people playing cards and we are viewing the game from one player's perspective. 2. Analyze the statement \\"A crowd of people play cards.\\" This statement says that there's a crowd of people playing cards, but it doesn't specify anything about a perspective. 3. Compare the two statements: - First statement: The presence of multiple players is mentioned, and the game is viewed from the perspective of one player. - Second statement: A crowd of people (implying a large number) is playing cards, but there's no information regarding perspective. 4. Based on the comparison of these two statements, it is clear that they share the aspect of multiple people playing cards. However, the first statement specifically refers to the perspective of one player, and the second statement does not. 5. So, the appropriate answer would be: \\"It is not possible to tell.\\" Although both statements involve multiple people playing cards, the given sentence doesn't provide enough context to confidently say if they're the same setting or situation. Otherwise, the element of perspective is missing in the second statement."},{"question":"Tady to je, pobral jsem to v hotelu. Which language is this?","response":"This sentence is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken predominantly in the Czech Republic. Allow me to provide a translation and additional information about the Czech language. The sentence \\"Tady to je, pobral jsem to v hotelu\\" translates to \\"Here it is, I picked it up at the hotel\\" in English. The Czech language is closely related to other Slavic languages, especially Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. It is spoken by over 10 million people in the Czech Republic and also by Czech communities worldwide. Czech is written using the Latin alphabet, with several additional diacritic marks (\`ě\`, \`š\`, \`č\`, \`ř\`, \`ž\`, \`ý\`, \`á\`, \`í\`, and \`é\`). Czech grammar is characterized by a complex system of inflection, which includes declensions (for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals) and conjugations (for verbs). Nouns in Czech have three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), and two numbers (singular and plural). The Czech language also features a rich vocabulary and a variety of speech registers, ranging from formal language or standard literary Czech to colloquial forms and regional dialects. Some well-known internationally-acclaimed Czech authors who have contributed to Czech literature include Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, Jaroslav Hašek, and Karel Čapek, who is credited with coining the word \\"robot\\" in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). Overall, the Czech language carries a long and rich history of culture and tradition. As a Slavic language, it shares similarities with neighboring languages, making it an interesting language to explore for those who are passionate about linguistics or Central European culture."},{"question":"I was livid and told him that I 'd done the diagnosing myself when the freakin ' cord snapped in my hand .

A sales attendant","response":"The speaker seems to be angry at the sales attendant or a representative from the company where they bought their mower (Option 4). The context provided in the statement indicates that the person was having issues with their mower and had potentially reached out for assistance, only to be met with a lack of empathy or understanding from the individual attending to their concerns. The tone of the conversation suggests frustration, as the speaker mentioned being \\"livid\\" and mentioning that they had \\"diagnosed\\" the problem themselves when the cord snapped in their hand. They believed they should not be charged for this issue (or potentially the repair), and they ultimately refused to pay and took their mower back. The other answer choices can be eliminated based on a lack of contextual evidence. There is no mention of a doctor (Option 2) or medical diagnosis, nor are there any family members mentioned in the passage (Option 3). Option 1, \\"None of the above choices\\", can be eliminated as well since the description of events fits in most closely with a sales attendant, or a similar role in the matter of the mower issue.

Which country had more of an impact on the carbon cycle? Answer:","response":"To determine which country had more of an impact on the carbon cycle, we will analyze the two methods of electricity production and evaluate their impact on CO2 emissions and the carbon cycle. Step 1: Analyze the fossil fuel-based electricity production in India India uses various types of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and oil to produce electricity. These fuels, when burned, release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, disrupting the carbon cycle and contributing to global warming. The total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-based electricity production in India can be calculated by adding up the emissions from coal, natural gas, and oil-based power plants. Step 2: Analyze the hydroelectric power generation in Nepal Nepal has opted for renewable energy, and hydroelectric power is a major source of electricity in this country. Hydroelectricity is generated by harnessing the kinetic energy of flowing water. This method of electricity production does not involve burning fuels and consequently does not emit CO2 or other greenhouse gases. Therefore, the impact on the carbon cycle from hydroelectric power generation in Nepal is minimal. Step 3: Compare the impact on the carbon cycle Comparing the two, it is apparent that India, with its fossil fuel-based electricity production, has a more significant impact on the carbon cycle. The burning of fossil fuels releases large amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the environment, altering the carbon cycle and contributing to global warming. In contrast, Nepal's hydroelectric power generation has a minimal effect on the carbon cycle and is considered a more environmentally friendly source of electricity. Answer: India has more of an impact on the carbon cycle compared to Nepal due to the country's dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation."},{"question":"Let's think step by step!

Stream-of-Consciousness Explanation: When considering if humans can breathe in space without any protective equipment, we have to take into account several factors that determine the survivability of humans in the vacuum of space. First off, the lack of atmosphere in space means there is no air or oxygen available for us to breathe, making it impossible for any human being to obtain the necessary oxygen to survive. Additionally, the extreme temperature fluctuations in space, ranging from scorching heat to freezing cold, would have a significant impact on the human body. Furthermore, the lack of atmospheric pressure in space would cause the gases dissolved in bodily fluids to form bubbles and expand. This phenomenon, similar to decompression sickness or \\"the bends\\" experienced by deep-sea divers, could lead to severe medical complications and even death if not managed properly. The exposure of the human body to cosmic radiation is yet another hazard that can have both short-term and long-term health consequences, such as acute radiation sickness and increased risk of cancer. Given all these factors, it is evident that humans cannot breathe in space without the appropriate protective gear or equipment. The hostile environment, along with the absolute lack of resources needed for basic biological functions, makes survival impossible for human beings without the necessary life support systems. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether humans can breathe in space without any protective equipment is a definitive no."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"The elements include GPRA, key management objectives, the President's Management Agenda, and 4Cs philosophy (consultation, cooperation, communication, all in the service of conservation).\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The elements included many things, such as GPRA. \\" is true (see options)?

Robinson in the movie \\"The Cincinnati Kid\\". 2. Consider the possible types of answers: An entity, abbreviation, description, human, location, or numeric value. 3. Rule out inapplicable response types: Since the query targets a game, we can eliminate options such as a human, location, and numeric value, as none of those would correspond to a game played within a movie. 4. Analyze the remaining possibilities: - Entity: A game could be classified as an entity, particularly if it represents a specific, well-defined concept or item. - Abbreviation: While a game could potentially have an abbreviated name, it is less likely that the abbreviation would be provided as the sole answer to the question. - Description: A description could be used to depict the nature of the game, but it would not directly provide the name of the game itself.

Both Robert and Dale have farms that approximately the same size. Dale prefers to produce milk conventionally, as he likes the way that conventional milk tastes. Robert, on the other hand, decided to switch to organic milk production after reading an article online about it. Whose farm, Robert's or Dale's, will produce lower emissions of methane? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, Robert's organic farm is likely to produce higher methane emissions when compared to Dale's conventional farm. The primary reasons for this are: 1. Lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds: Organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms which implies that more cows might be needed overall to produce the same amount of milk on an organic farm, leading to higher methane emissions from the animals. 2. Increased use of roughage: The increased use of roughage (forage), such as grass, in the organic farms often leads to a greater release of methane by cows, as their digestive system has to break down the fibrous materials. This process, called enteric fermentation, produces methane as a byproduct. While organic milk production has some potential environmental benefits, such as a lower eutrophication potential and reduced pesticide usage, the methane emissions per unit of milk produced are generally higher in organic dairies when compared to conventional dairies. However, it is important to consider that methane emissions might not be the only factor when comparing the overall environmental impact of organic and conventional dairy farming."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

They are through to the Champions League knockout phase after winning their group and are level on points at the top of La Liga with Barcelona going into Saturday's trip to the Nou Camp (although Barca have a game in hand). The man behind Atletico's success is manager Diego Simeone, the fiery Argentine who for many years was best known in England for his role in David Beckham's red card in the 1998 World Cup finals but is now firmly established as one of the game's finest coaches. In recent weeks, Simeone has repeatedly been linked with a summer move to Chelsea, and that is no surprise considering his success at the Vicente Calderon. When he returned to Atletico, who he had played for in December 2011, they had won only two trophies in 15 years. Under Simeone they have claimed five: the Europa League and Uefa Super Cup in 2012; the Copa del Rey in 2013; La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup in 2014. And those triumphs are even more impressive when you consider they have been achieved on a fraction of the budgets enjoyed by Atletico's chief competitors, Real Madrid and Barcelona. So it is clear Simeone is a very good manager indeed. But what makes him so special, what would he bring to the Premier League, and would he even consider making the move? A cursory glance at statistics tells you Atletico's greatest quality is their defensive strength. Their title-winning campaign was based upon by far the best defensive record in Spain and this season they have been even more difficult to score against, conceding only eight goals in 21 league games. Indeed, their record of just three goals conceded from the opening 11 away fixtures has never been achieved before in La Liga. In part, Atletico's defensive excellence is down to the magnificence of Diego Godin, the impeccably reliable Uruguayan centre-back. More than individuals, though, Atletico's resilience at the back can be explained by the rigorous positional discipline and insatiable work ethic instilled by Simeone, whose approach to football is regularly summed up with one word: intensity. Those who remember Simeone's playing career will be familiar with that quality. He was a relentlessly hard-working midfielder who enjoyed great success with Atletico, Inter Milan, Lazio and the Argentina national team, among others. He has now succeeded in transmitting that kind of passion into his players, and on matchdays he provides a powerful, prowling presence on the touchline - especially during home games, where he can be regularly seen turning to the Vicente Calderon fans and beseeching them to raise the volume of their support. At times, Simeone's emotion can spill over. In the latter stages of the 2014 Champions League final defeat by Real, he was sent to the stands after running onto the pitch to rage at opposing defender Raphael Varane, and later in the year he received an eight-game ban after confronting the officials during another game against Real. But he does seem to have calmed down since then, perhaps learning the lesson that his team suffers when his temper boils over. Or maybe the next explosion is just around the corner. There is, however, much more to Simeone's strategy than passion and discipline. One of his most vocal admirers is Michael Robinson, the former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television analyst. Speaking to BBC Sport, Robinson argues there is a great fallacy in the common perception of the Atletico boss, noting: \\"When someone has a reputation for a particular thing, it can be hard to shake off. \\"People know Simeone was a hard player and that Atletico are a hard team, so they think it's all huff and puff, diligence and defending. But the truth is he's not at all one-dimensional - he's very astute tactically and a real admirer of talent. \\"The year they won the league, he would often change the tactics three or four times a game. For example, they'd start by going long to Diego Costa, forcing the opposition to defend deeper, and then they could start to play shorter because they had created space.\\" It is certainly true that Atletico's defensive sturdiness and propensity for scoring scrappy goals from set-pieces encourages onlookers to disregard the silkier aspects of their play, including Simeone's willingness to incorporate creative, flair players if they are also prepared to work hard. In the past, that role was filled by Arda Turan, the gifted Turk who was signed last summer by Barcelona; now, a lighter touch to counterbalance the trademark intensity is provided by highly skilled performers such as Antoine Griezmann, Yannick Carrasco and Luciano Vietto. Indeed, there is a growing sense the current Atletico crop plays in a very different manner to the team that shocked the football world by overcoming Barcelona and Real for the La Liga title two years ago. \\"Simeone gives a concession to artistry,\\" states Robinson. \\"One of his great strengths is taking artistic players and giving them his work ethic without sacrificing their flamboyance. \\"I've seen Atletico grow, and in some ways they are now considerably better than the team which won the league - he has incorporated players with more natural talent and they can be very eloquent with the ball. \\"He certainly isn't just an old-school manager who only tells his players to roll up their sleeves and get stuck in.\\" From the way Atletico players regularly celebrate their goals by racing to the sidelines and embracing their manager, it is clear Simeone is greatly admired and respected within his squad. In Spain, he is widely known by his nickname, 'El Cholo', and the past couple of years have seen 'Cholismo' reach almost cult-like status among followers who admire his maxims asserting nothing in life can be achieved without hard work and dedication. Simeone loves Atletico's role as underdogs, regularly using their place in Barca and Real's shadows as a motivational tool - in the run-up to the 2014 title triumph he famously declared: \\"We see ourselves reflected in society, in people who have to fight. People identify with us. We're a source of hope.\\" But in addition to delivering stirring words, Simeone's astute football mind also allows him to get the most out of players by improving the technical and tactical aspects of their game. A great example is Griezmann, who was always a highly regarded youngster during his early days with Real Sociedad but has rapidly matured into a world-class talent since joining Atletico in 2014. \\"The change in Griezmann is quite wondrous,\\" enthuses Robinson. \\"Cholo has converted him into a most unbelievable all-round forward, who will one second be making a tackle on the edge of his own area and the next be shooting on the edge of the other. \\"It didn't happen overnight, but within the space of three months of working with Simeone there was a spectacular transition.\\" So, is this passionate, tactically astute, inspirational and, above all, successful manager ready to take his considerable talents to England? Not so fast. This is not the first time Simeone has been linked with a move away from Atletico, with his title-winning exploits in 2014 inevitably resulting in similar speculation. But he rejected all advances and last year signed a new contract to stay with his current club until 2020. \\"Why would he leave?\\" asks Robinson, who believes Simeone has more work to do at the Vicente Calderon. \\"I think he's got a challenge here - he has already done away with the duopoly of Real Madrid and Barcelona, and now I think he's got the ambition to make Atletico Madrid natural contenders, or even favourites, for every competition they play in.\\" Of course, it could be argued that after so many years of lagging behind Real Madrid and Barcelona in financial terms, Simeone would relish the opportunity to join a club such as Chelsea where signing world-class talent became a realistic option. But Atletico are rapidly growing off the pitch, boosted by additional revenue following their recent part-acquisition by the massive Chinese property investment company Wanda Group. And they will take another big step forward next year by moving into a new 70,000-capacity stadium. Although Robinson would not entirely rule out the prospect of Simeone abandoning Atletico at such an exciting period in their history, he can only foresee that scenario unfolding in a certain set of circumstances. \\"Knowing Cholo, I don't think he's worried about cheque books or personal recognition,\\" smiles Robinson. \\"He could leave if he falls out with someone at Atletico, or if he's getting bored, or if he feels the players are getting tired of listening to him. \\"But for his career aspirations, I don't think he could go anywhere better.\\" So, Roman Abramovich, be warned: Simeone might be the man you want, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get him. A summary of the above article is?","response":"Atletico Madrid has once again risen to become strong contenders in both the Champions League knockout phase and the top of La Liga, rivaling teams such as Barcelona. This success can be attributed to their manager, Diego Simeone, who has helped the team claim five trophies since 2012. Under Simeone's management, Atletico has become known for its defensive strength and rigorous positional discipline, as well as incorporating creative flair players who are willing to work hard. As a result, the team has outperformed expectations despite operating on a fraction of the budget enjoyed by rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona. Simeone's success has led to speculation about a move to Chelsea in the future, but his commitment to Atletico Madrid, where he recently signed a contract extension until 2020, and the growth of the club in terms of finances and infrastructure may make a move unlikely. Michael Robinson, a close observer of the Spanish game, believes that Simeone's ambition is to transform Atletico into natural contenders for every competition they participate in, suggesting that a move away from the club might not be in his best interests. However, Simeone's tactical acumen, ability to get the most out of his players, and affinity with fans make him an appealing option for clubs looking to hire a successful manager."},{"question":"Solve -5*o = 40 - 15 for o.","response":"To solve the given equation -5*o = 40 - 15 for the variable o, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation wherever possible.

In this case, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is -5: (-5*o) / (-5) = 25 / (-5) Step 3: Perform the division on both sides: o = -5 So the solution to the equation -5*o = 40 - 15 for o is o = -5."},{"question":"Article: Tesla is losing more money than expected as it nears the launch of its first mass market car. On Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) reported a loss of 330 million for the first three months of the year, far exceeding Wall Street's estimates and up from 282 million a year earlier. The larger loss comes even as Tesla reported strong sales for the quarter. It posted revenue of 2.7 billion, more than double from a year earlier, fueled by shipping a record 25,051 cars. Tesla is spending heavily ahead of the Model 3 launch, which it says is still on track to start production in July. \\"I don't know anything that would prevent us from starting production in July,\\" Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, said on a conference call with analysts. \\"There may be something that pops up, but I don't know what it is today.\\" In preparation for the Model 3 launch, Tesla says it's \\"significantly expanding our infrastructure to support Tesla owners,\\" according to a shareholder letter Wednesday. That includes plans for 100 more retail, delivery and service locations globally as well as opening Tesla's first body repair shops. Tesla also reiterated plans to \\"at least\\" double the number of charging stations. Related: Tesla just became the most valuable carmaker in America Tesla says it expects to be able to support production of 5,000 Model 3 cars a week this year and 10,000 a week next year. But the company also admitted to some unpredictability as it gears up for the launch. \\"Given that we will be ramping Model 3 production so quickly ... even a couple-week shift in timing can have a meaningful impact on total deliveries,\\" the company wrote in its shareholder letter. Some analysts are sounding a cautionary note about the Model 3. \\"In this climate of low fuel prices, an administration that favors less stringent environmental controls and a market proliferation of full-electric offerings from mainstream manufacturers, the launch might be a difficult one,\\" Jack Nerad, executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book, said in a statement. The Model 3 has already created at least one other unique headache for Tesla: Some customers apparently assume it's an upgrade to the earlier Model S because of its name and are therefore holding off buying the S. In fact, the Model 3 name doesn't signify a third-generation Tesla.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29. If you execute your enemies, it saves you the trouble of having to forgive them. The answer to this question is:","response":"Travis and Bowie"},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraphs, some supporting facts and an answer of a question. Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Input: Context_1 : Per Fine Ounce is the title of an unpublished novel by Geoffrey Jenkins featuring Ian Fleming's James Bond. It was completed c.1966 and is considered a \\"lost\\" novel by fans of James Bond because it was actually commissioned by Glidrose Productions, the official publishers of James Bond. It was rejected for publication, however, missing the opportunity to become the first continuation James Bond novel. \\"The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½\\", a novel written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott, was later published in 1967 featuring James Bond's nephew; \\"Colonel Sun\\" written by Kingsley Amis under the pseudonym Robert Markham was published in 1968 as the first adult continuation novel following Ian Fleming's \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" (1965). Context_2 : The Life of Ian Fleming is a biography of Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond and author of the children’s book \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\". The biography was written by John Pearson, Fleming’s assistant at the London \\"Sunday Times,\\" in 1966. Pearson later wrote the official, fictional-biography \\"\\" in 1973. \\"The Life of Ian Fleming\\" was one of the first biographies of Ian Fleming and is considered a collectible book by many James Bond fans, since Pearson would become the third, official James Bond author. Context_3 : Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions \\"James Bond\\" film series and the first to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, the film marks the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name. \\"Casino Royale\\" is a reboot of the film series and as such is set at the beginning of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. After preventing a terrorist attack at Miami International Airport, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, the treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs to bankrupt a terrorist financier, Le Chiffre, by beating him in a high-stakes poker game. The story arc continues in the following \\"Bond\\" film \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (2008), \\"Skyfall\\" (2012), and \\"Spectre\\" (2015) also feature explicit references to characters and events in this film. Context_4 : Ian Fleming: Where Bond Began was a 2008 documentary presented by Joanna Lumley which explored the life of the author Ian Fleming and the origin of his character James Bond. It was first broadcast on BBC One at 6:10pm on Sunday 19 October 2008 and was commissioned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth and the then forthcoming release of the film \\"Quantum of Solace\\". Context_5 : Felix Leiter is a 2017 comic book miniseries featuring the eponymous character, who is primarily featured in Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and various other formats by several other creators. Written by James Robinson and illustrated by Aaron Campbell, the comic book is a spin-off from the \\"James Bond\\" series published by Dynamite Entertainment, making its debut in January 2017. It also marks the first time for Bond's ally and friend, Felix Leiter to get a solo adventure in any format overall. It is also licensed by Ian Fleming Publications that hold the literary rights to the James Bond franchise. Bond himself makes a cameo appearance in the comic book as part of a flashback. Context_6 : The James Bond literary franchise is a series of novels and short stories, first published in 1953 by Ian Fleming, a British author, journalist, and former naval intelligence officer. James Bond, often referred to by his code name, 007, is a British Secret Service agent; the character was created by journalist and author Ian Fleming, and first appeared in his 1953 novel \\"Casino Royale\\"; the books are set in a contemporary period, between May 1951 and February 1964. Fleming went on to write a total of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, all written at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of his books were published after his death in 1964. Context_7 : Light of My Death is a 1993 spy comic book featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond in the central role of the plot, written by Das Petrou and illustrated by John Watkiss. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in issues #8-11 of \\"Dark Horse Comics\\".

In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her family. The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman Dominic Greene, a member of the Quantum organisation, who intends to stage a \\"coup d'état\\" in Bolivia to seize control of their water supply. Context_9 : Kissy Suzuki is a fictional character introduced in Ian Fleming's 1964 \\"James Bond\\" novel, \\"You Only Live Twice\\". Despite Bond's womanizing, Kissy Suzuki (at least the literary version) remains the only character known to the reader who bears a child by him. She is also one of the few known Bond girls (also in literature) to have died as a result of a non-violent, natural death (although that death does not occur in the Bond canon, but rather in a short story written by someone other than Ian Fleming). The treatment of Kissy varies greatly between the novel and the film, where she is never identified by her name, no family name appears in the closing credits, and the film ends in the usual Bond-style happy ending. Context_10 : Vesper Lynd is a fictional character featured in Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale\\". She was portrayed by Ursula Andress in the 1967 James Bond parody, which is only slightly based on the novel, and by Eva Green in the 2006 adaptation. fact_1 : Quantum of Solace (2008) is the twenty-second spy film in the \\"James Bond\\" series produced by Eon Productions, directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. fact_2 : In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her family. fact_3 : Vesper Lynd is a fictional character featured in Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale\\".

Chievo Verona, and Torino F.C., demonstrating his versatile expertise and dedication to various clubs within the competitive landscape."},{"question":"I can use this background: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Answer this question please: In respect to decision C, would Keith's strategy most likely maximize or not maximize the expected utility? A:","response":"In respect to decision C, Keith's strategy of relying on his hunches would most likely not maximize the expected utility. Here's the reasoning: 1. The optimal decision-making process that John would use involves calculating the expected utility, which is a probability-weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision. 2. Since decision C has an uncertain outcome, John would utilize the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms to maximize the expected utility for decision C by considering all probable outcomes and assigning utility values to each of them. 3. On the other hand, Keith relies on his hunches rather than following a structured decision-making process. This means his decisions are largely influenced by his intuition, gut feelings, and personal biases. 4. Intuition and gut feelings might sometimes result in good decisions, but depending solely on them instead of evaluating potential outcomes and their utilities carries the risk of making suboptimal choices. 5. Due to the lack of a systematic approach when relying on hunches, it is less likely for Keith's strategy to consistently maximize the expected utility in comparison to John's optimal decision-making process. So, the answer is that Keith's strategy would most likely not maximize the expected utility in respect to decision C."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a text from tweets and a boolean question whether this tweet has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution (YOI), a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said in a report. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution, a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons said in a report (file photo) The number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous HMIP inspection, but remained 'too high' with 262 incidents in the six months before the visit, including 79 assaults on staff. Some incidents were deemed 'very serious' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a 'very determined way'. Feltham is divided into two sites, with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site A, separated from 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site B. Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said: 'The welcome reduction in the number of boys in custody means that those who remain are a more concentrated mix of very troubled boys who sometimes display very challenging and violent behaviour. 'As at other YOIs for this age group, staff in Feltham A still struggled to manage this behaviour in a safe and secure way. 'Staff need more help to do this and I repeat my call for the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to initiate an independent expert review of its policies and resources for managing behaviour, reducing bullying and supporting victims across all YOIs.' Use of force had increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good. Around a quarter of boys spent 23 hours a day locked up in their cell, which critics said amounted to solitary confinement. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. The number of fights and assaults has reduced since the last HMIP inspection (file photo) The report calls for 'new thinking' about how to tackle the 'debilitating and seemingly intractable' problem of gangs, violence and anti-social behaviour among young people. The site for young adults still faces significant challenges, inspectors said, particularly a high level of staff vacancies. However, the report did flag significant progress at site B, with a drop in fights and assaults and a decrease in use of batons against inmates. During the inspection, eight foreign national prisoners were being held beyond the end of their sentence - including one who had been inside for two years after the end of his sentence. Inspectors labelled this delay 'completely unacceptable'. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: 'One in four boys in Feltham prison is spending 23 hours a day locked up in his cell in conditions which amount to solitary confinement. This is unacceptable. 'Despite some improvements, violence is endemic, including 79 assaults on staff in six months. It is particularly concerning that the use of force on children has increased dramatically since the last inspection. Use of force has increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good (file photo) 'However, the problems outlined in this report are not confined to Feltham - they mirror the findings of a series of inspections conducted across the country in recent months. 'Staff are rightly praised by the inspectorate, but they are working in challenging environments where they are being asked to achieve the impossible. 'It is high time we stopped locking up children in large, violent institutions and invest instead in what works in rehabilitating children whilst keeping them safe.' A previous inspection of site B in March 2013 called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run. Inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted. Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service (Noms), said: 'As this report makes clear the challenge faced by the governor and staff at Feltham should not be underestimated. 'Many of the young people in their care have strong gang affiliations and a history of violence. 'Managing their behaviour and supporting them to change and turn their lives around is a difficult and complex task. In this context the improvements achieved over the last 12 months are particularly impressive and the governor and his staff deserve huge credit for what has been achieved. 'There is no easy answer to the challenges presented by the young men in Feltham but we are committed to working positively with our partners in the YJB and in the wider community to reduce violence, prevent victims and support effective rehabilitation.'","response":"Inspectors at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution (YOI) discovered that inmates represented 48 different gangs, leading to a \\"constant juggling\\" to keep them apart.

Article: The most important holiday in spring, especially for Christians, is Easter. This Christian holiday is not on the same date every year,but it's always on a Sunday. It can be any Sunday between March 22 and April 25. Many people celebrate Easter by buying new clothes. Children celebrate by hunting for colored eggs that their parents have hidden around the house. People also give Easter baskets filled with candy and other goodies to one another to celebrate the day. But the holiday is more than new clothes and good things to eat. On Easter, many people go to church to celebrate Jesus' resurrection from the dead. Most people color Easter eggs. Some people hide them. Others just eat them. But no matter what one does with Easter eggs,they are an important Easter tradition throughout the Western world. People from many different cultures celebrate Easter. In both America and Belgium, children look for Easter eggs hidden on lawns and in bushes. In America, children believe the eggs are hidden by the Easter bunny .But in Belgium, the hidden eggs are supposed to have fallen from church bells. In Bulgaria , red Easter eggs are lucky in churches. Bulgarian families also hit these Easter eggs together to see whose is the strongest. The winner looks forward to good fortune that year.

Joe Boyd, whose skillful handling of the band had contributed much to their international success, stopped managing them and returned to the US. The group left Elektra Records and signed with Island, for whom they recorded five albums. The first was a soundtrack to the \\"Be Glad...\\" film, and this was followed by the eclectic Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air, regarded as their best album for some time. The band continued to tour and record. Rose Simpson left in 1971 and was replaced by Malcolm Le Maistre, formerly of the Stone Monkey troupe. Mike Heron took time out to record a well-received solo album, Smiling Men with Bad Reputations, which, in contrast to the ISB's self-contained productions, featured a host of session guests, among them Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Keith Moon, John Cale and Richard Thompson. The following year, Licorice left, and was replaced by Gerard Dott, an Edinburgh jazz musician and friend of both Heron and Williamson who had contributed to Smiling Men. Williamson also recorded a solo album, Myrrh, which featured some of his most extraordinary vocal performances.

Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A former astronaut who was accused of assaulting a romantic rival in the parking lot of the Orlando airport will avoid prison after pleading guilty to lesser charges as part of a plea agreement. Citing Lisa Marie Nowak's lack of a criminal history, Orange County Circuit Judge Marc Lubet sentenced her to a year of probation. She was given credit for the two days she served in the county jail after her arrest. Nowak, 46, must also perform 50 hours of community service and have no contact with the victim in the case, former Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman. She must also send Shipman a letter of apology within 10 days, \\"a sincere letter of apology, not one of these vanilla things that I see from other defendants,\\" Lubet told","response":"Nowak during the hearing. The judge also ordered her to undergo a mental health evaluation and follow any recommended treatment plan. In addition, Nowak must also pay any required fines and court costs associated with the case. The charges stemmed from a February 2007 incident in which Nowak confronted Shipman in the parking lot of the Orlando International Airport. Authorities said Nowak, who was wearing a disguise at the time, used pepper spray on her romantic rival. The former astronaut was initially charged with attempted kidnapping, battery, and burglary. However, under the terms of the plea agreement, Nowak pleaded guilty to the lesser charges of misdemeanor battery and felony burglary of a vehicle. The judge's decision to accept the plea deal can be attributed to Nowak's lack of prior criminal record, her willingness to cooperate with the legal process, and her potential for rehabilitation."},{"question":"I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Now, I have a new situation: John has just started working at a new company.

China Cabinet A good place to keep a saucer you don't use but want to look at is in a china cabinet. Here is a detailed explanation of each option: A. Kitchen - While you can display your saucer in the kitchen, it might not be the best place due to the potential exposure to cooking fumes, grease, and moisture, which could result in discoloration or damage to your cherished piece. B. Tea room - A tea room might be a suitable place to display your saucer, as it is a designated space for tea-related items. However, not every home has a dedicated tea room, and it may not be the best option for those who want to protect their delicate items from potential accidents during tea service. C. China cabinet - The china cabinet is the best place to display your saucer, as it offers a secure and controlled environment for your fragile and precious items. China cabinets usually come with glass doors, allowing you to have a clear view of your displayed pieces while keeping them safe from dust, contaminants, and potential accidents. The cabinets also help in controlling humidity and temperature, ensuring the longevity and preservation of your saucer. D. Kitchen cabinet - A kitchen cabinet can store your saucer securely, but it might not allow you to admire the piece since the cabinet doors are typically opaque. Furthermore, it may not provide optimal protection, as moisture and temperature fluctuations in the kitchen might affect the condition of your saucer over time. E. Cup - Placing a saucer inside a cup is not an ideal solution for displaying the item, as this would hide its beauty and intricate designs. It also puts your saucer at risk of damage when the cup is used or moved around. In conclusion, a china cabinet is the best option for displaying a saucer you don't use but want to look at. It provides you with the opportunity to admire your piece while ensuring its safety, preservation, and protection from environmental factors and potential accidents."},{"question":"weather at silkeborg, denmark 17° - temperature Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","response":"To capitalize the given sentence, I'll follow these steps: 1.

We have this equation: 277 * v = -250 * v + 490 * v + 37 First, let's add the values that have 'v' together on the right side. So, we'll add -250 * v and 490 * v. Let's see: -250 * v + 490 * v = 240 * v (because 490 - 250 = 240) Now our equation looks like this: 277 * v = 240 * v + 37 Next, we want to get all the 'v' terms on one side and the number on the other side. So let's subtract 240 * v from both sides of the equation. Here's what we get: 277 * v - 240 * v = 37 Now, let's find the difference between 277 * v and 240 * v: 37 * v = 37 Finally, to find the value of 'v', let's divide both sides of the equation by 37: v = 1 And there you go, buddy!

Singing aloud will not just lift the spirits---it's good for your physical health as well. Filling the lungs with air, increasing the heart rate and getting blood pumping round the body faster can all help our physical health. For the past few years Heart Research UK has been Funding a Christmas campaign aimed at getting people singing, simply for the benefit it can bring. The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. \\"Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection. It also brings a great amount of happiness. It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch .\\" Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress. \\"And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect. It increases our sense of satisfaction with ourselves, a greater sense of feeling included. \\" Helen Astrid, a singing teacher, also sees the great effects that singing brings. \\"It lifts us up on a spiritual level, it helps our self-respect, and it's great for all ages from small kids to grannies--you can have a good sing and _ .\\" But she warns people not to have too many beers or glasses of wine, though a glass may help them gather courage before taking to the stage during the holidays.

Before starting the cycle, make sure to double-check that all items are properly arranged and do not obstruct the spray arms or prevent the door from closing. Then, select the desired wash cycle according to the manufacturer's guidelines and type and level of dirtiness of your dishes. Common options include normal, heavy, delicate, eco, or quick wash cycles. Press the start button or activate the dishwasher control panel to initiate the cycle. Once the dishwasher cycle has started, the dishwasher will fill up with water, mix it with the detergent, and then spray the water and detergent mixture onto your dishes through the spray arms. This process removes the dirt and grime from your dishes as the water is recirculated and constantly sprayed onto the dishes at a high pressure. After a certain period, the dishwasher will drain this dirty water and refill itself with fresh water for the rinse cycle. After rinsing the dishes, the dishwasher will drain the water once more and then initiate the drying process. This typically involves heating the dishwasher's interior using heating elements or a combination of residual heat and a fan to circulate air. Once the drying process is complete, the dishwasher cycle will conclude, and the dishwasher will turn off automatically. After the entire dishwasher cycle has finished, wait a few minutes to allow any remaining steam to dissipate, and open the dishwasher door to check if your dishes are clean and dry.

Energy; (7). Energy.; (8). water; Fact 1: Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms. Fact 2: Aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols. Given the two facts above, what is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols? Answer:","response":"Given the two facts provided, it can be concluded that oxygen (5) is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming Volatile Organic Acids (VOAs) and alcohols. Let's dive deeper into why this is the case. Fact 1: Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms. Cellular respiration is a process in which cells produce energy by breaking down organic molecules, such as glucose. Aerobic organisms, or organisms that rely on oxygen for their energy production, utilize oxygen as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain - a series of protein complexes found in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. This chain effectively extracts energy from electrons, using the difference in their energy levels to generate ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) - the primary source of energy for cellular processes. Fact 2: Aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols. Volatile Organic Acids (VOAs) and alcohols can serve as alternative substrates or nutrients for the growth and maintenance of certain aerobic organisms, including bacteria and yeasts. In these cases, these microorganisms will utilize VOAs and alcohols as a source of carbon and energy, preferentially breaking them down in their metabolic pathways. Since oxygen is an essential component of cellular respiration in aerobic organisms and these organisms consume VOAs and alcohols, it is clear that oxygen is crucial to the respiration process in those that metabolize these substrates. Therefore, oxygen is indeed essential for cellular respiration in organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols."},{"question":"I heard that Kai found a box of tissues and tried to clean their nose as best as they could. And I was wondering What will Kai want to do next? Pick from: a. buy more tissues. b. rent a suit. c. did this to be cleanly. Answer:","response":"Kai's decision to clean their nose using the tissues from the box reflects a concern for personal hygiene and well-being. It is likely that they chose this action to be cleanly (c), as maintaining cleanliness and avoiding spreading germs should be a priority, especially in the current context of global health. It's important for individuals to take care of themselves and prevent the transmission of illnesses to others. Considering the different options presented, it can be deduced that buying more tissues (a) would be the most probable next step for Kai. After using the box of tissues to clean their nose, they might be running low on supplies or might just want to be prepared for any future need. Having extra tissues on hand is always a good idea, as they can be utilized for various purposes, such as wiping hands, cleaning surfaces, or addressing sudden sneezes or runny noses. Renting a suit (b) doesn't seem to be directly related to their initial action of cleaning their nose. However, if we think beyond the initial options, it is possible that Kai could have an event or special occasion to attend that would require them to rent a suit. If that is the case, then ensuring personal cleanliness and hygiene would be of utmost importance before attending the event. This could further emphasize option (c), as it would highlight the significance of being cleanly in various aspects of Kai's life. In conclusion, I believe that Kai, after cleaning their nose with the tissues, would most likely want to buy more tissues (a) to restock their supply. This action would also reinforce their goal of being cleanly (c), as having tissues readily available would support their ongoing efforts to maintain personal hygiene and prevent the spreading of germs. Renting a suit (b) could be a potential option in the future, depending on Kai's plans and the importance of cleanliness at those events."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Mohammed Labead, 19, seriously injured PC Lee Wilson, 42, as he went to the aid of colleague Sgt Rachael Shearing after an assault on a girl. Labead, of Norwich, yesterday admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on PC Wilson without intent on January 19 this year. Scroll down for video PC Lee Wilson attempts to grapple with Mohammed Labead outside Mojo's nightclub in Norwich in January Labead managed to break free from PC Wilson's grip and started pushing him towards the corner He said","response":"the attack occurred after he had consumed a large amount of alcohol and could not remember much of the night, including attacking the officer. Sentencing Labead at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Stephen Holt told him that his actions had caused significant harm to PC Wilson and that this was a serious matter. Judge Holt stated that Labead had demonstrated a lack of respect for the police and that his attack caused distress to the officers on the scene. The court heard that on the night of the incident, PC Wilson and Sgt Shearing were called to Mojo's nightclub following reports of an altercation involving a girl who had been assaulted. Upon arriving at the scene, they found Labead acting aggressively and shouting at other clubbers. Believing that Labead may have been responsible for the assault, they attempted to apprehend him. The scene outside the nightclub was chaotic as Labead resisted arrest, trying to break free from the officers and push PC Wilson to the ground. As the struggle continued, PC Wilson's leg was badly broken in multiple places. The officers were eventually able to subdue Labead with the help of additional police backup. PC Wilson was then rushed to a nearby hospital for emergency surgery on his leg. During the court proceedings, Labead expressed remorse for his actions and claimed that the attack was not a true reflection of his character. His defense counsel argued that Labead had no previous history of violence and had been under the influence of excessive alcohol, which clouded his judgment. Judge Holt took these factors into consideration along with Labead's early guilty plea. He acknowledged Labead's remorse but stated that it was crucial to send a strong message that attacks on police officers would not be tolerated. Consequently, Labead was sentenced to 28 months in prison for the crime. As the story comes to an end, Mohammed Labead begins to serve his prison sentence while reflecting on the consequences of his actions. Meanwhile, PC Wilson embarks on a long road to recovery, undergoing extensive physical rehabilitation to regain the use of his leg. The incident underlines the dangers that police officers face every day and the importance of respecting law enforcement. In addition to the physical scars, the emotional trauma inflicted on both PC Wilson and Sgt Shearing will leave a lasting impact on their lives and careers. The event also serves as a reminder to society of the potential consequences of excessive alcohol consumption and the importance of responsible drinking. Overall, the story ends with a harsh lesson learned for all parties involved. Mohammed Labead must now face the consequences of his actions and work towards rebuilding his life after serving his sentence. Similarly, PC Wilson and Sgt Shearing will continue to heal from the ordeal, further strengthening their dedication to protecting and serving their community."},{"question":"Answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Danny often caddies for Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), a free-spirited lothario, talented golfer, and the son of one of Bushwood's co-founders. Danny decides to gain favor with Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), the country club's arrogant co-founder and director of the caddy scholarship program, by caddying for him. Meanwhile, Carl Spackler (Bill Murray), one of the greenskeepers, is entrusted with combatting a potentially disastrous gopher infestation. Throughout the film, Carl tries a variety of methods to kill the gopher (e.g. shooting, drowning) without success. Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), a fiery, foulmouthed, disrespectful, libidinous ethnic hunk of pure nouveau riche, looked down upon by Judge Smails, begins appearing at the club. Smails is heckled by Czervik as he tees off, causing his shot to go badly wrong. Smails eventually throws a putter away in anger and accidentally injures a member of the club. Danny takes responsibility for the incident, as a ploy to gain Smails' trust. Smails encourages him to apply for the caddy scholarship. At Bushwood's annual Fourth of July banquet, Danny and his girlfriend Maggie (Sarah Holcomb) work as servers. Czervik continues to frustrate Smails with his loutish behavior, while Danny becomes attracted to Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), Smails' promiscuous niece.

The new survey by Lord Ashcroft puts the Greens up three points in just a week, ahead of the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip, after their profile was boosted by a row over being excluded from TV debates. The poll and focus group findings will make grim reading for the other parties, with Labour and the Tories both on less than 30 per cent and Ed Miliband likened to a zoo animal 'you're not bothered whether you see or not'. The latest survey for Lord Ashcroft puts the Green party on 11 per cent, up three points in a week. While much attention has been focused on the rise of Ukip in recent months, the Greens have made steady gains. The party boasts that its membership had reached 44,175 in England and Wales, higher than the 41,943 claimed by Ukip last week and almost level with the 44,526 issued by the Liberal Democrats in November. The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously. One in five people saying they will back the Greens voted Lib Dem in 2010, precisely the people Labour needs to woo to win. The Ashcroft survey puts the Tories ahead on 29 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent. Ukip is on 15 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Lord Ashcroft said: 'One factor could be that the Greens have benefited from their prominence in the arguments over TV debates – in which case it will be interesting to see in the coming weeks whether they can sustain their share.' The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously, with former Lib Dems turning Green. As a nation of animal lovers, it is no surprise Britons come to see their politicians as members of the animal kingdom. But a lot depends on whether they are a predator or prey depends. Lord Ashcroft asked a series of focus groups what they thought of the party leaders. He found David Cameron was viewed as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was branded a peacock or a weasel while Nick Clegg was dismissed as 'a Chihuahua in David Cameron’s handbag'. But Labour's Ed Miliband left most voters blank, telling the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' Today Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics'. She said it was vital for her party to be included in any TV debates to provide balance as voters are moving away from the 'old boys' club' of Westminster. Ms Bennett was speaking at the launch of a poster campaign aimed at the leaders of the main parties, entitled 'What are you afraid of, boys?', to challenge broadcasters to include the Greens in any televised debates between party leaders. Ms Bennett said: 'I have seen a whole slew of surveys last week that showed that the public want the Green Party represented in these debates, and of course we had a petition with 275,000 people saying, 'invite the Greens'. 'The arguments don't stack up - the broadcasters have to invite the Greens.' 'It is very clear that we should be there if this is going to be a balanced debate.' Ms Bennett said it was time to move on from the traditional 'old boys' club of Westminster, and that debates should be inclusive and help promote that. Last week she wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip Leader Nigel Farage, urging them to back calls for them to be involved in the debates. She revealed Mr Farage had written back to her, 'basically saying 'no'.' 'This is the Green surge,' Ms Bennett said. 'We don't know where it is going, but it is certain that politics in Britain is not going to be the same again, and that is a very good thing. 'Let's get past the debating about the debates and let's actually debate the issues that we so desperately need, given the state of Britain today.' Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics' Asked what sort of animal Labour's Ed Miliband would be, the focus group told the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' David Cameron was viewed by voters as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody' Ms Bennett said the 'Green surge' pointed to the fact that politics is changing 'very fast', and that the main political parties were afraid of the political ground shifting. She said: 'There is a real potential at this election that we could see politics break wide open.' Polls and studies suggest Britain politics faces being plunged into chaos after the election, with at least three parties would be needed to form a coalition. At the weekend political commentator Iain Dale predict Labour will win 300 seats and the Tories 279, but both would need at least two other parties to secure a majority of the 650 MPs in the Commons. A separate survey showed a third of Scots want to see Britain run by a Labour-SNP coalition which could put Alex Salmond in the Cabinet. Mr Miliband faces the grim prospect of a Labour wipeout north of the border, seriously damaging his hopes of securing an overall majority in the general election in May. Highlights:","response":"- A new opinion poll shows that 11% of people support the Green Party, which is ahead of the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip. - This increase in support may be because people are paying attention to the Green Party after they were denied being in TV debates. - The Green Party's membership is now larger than Ukip's and almost the same as the Liberal Democrats. - Some people think that the Labour Party should try to get back the voters who switched from Lib Dem to Green, in order to win more support."},{"question":"You are given a new situation: Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead.

Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\".

John Dowd resigned Thursday as President Donald Trump’s lead lawyer for the Russia investigation amid a wider shakeup of Trump’s legal team that raised new questions about Trump’s strategy for dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller. Dowd stepped down just days after he issued a statement calling for Mueller’s probe to be shuttered, which he first attributed with his title as the president’s lawyer and then backtracked to say he was speaking only for himself. Story Continued Below “I love the president and wish him well,” Dowd said in an email to POLITICO. Dowd, a prominent Washington white collar defense attorney with a prickly demeanor, signed on as a personal attorney to the president last June and recently had been spearheading negotiations with Mueller for a potential interview with the president. But the 77-year old attorney had grown increasingly frustrated by his work for Trump, according to a source familiar with the Trump legal team strategy. Dowd was particularly upset to learn on Monday that Trump had decided to hire Joseph diGenova, another bulldog lawyer and scandal veteran to help with his Russia response. Trump had also been gauging interest from other prominent attorneys, including former George W. Bush Solicitor General Ted Olson, who recently turned down an offer from Trump by citing conflicts with his law firm. Trump’s legal team has long been riven by a debate about how Trump should handle Mueller’s investigation in both political and legal terms. Dowd had preached a confrontational approach, warning Trump of the risks of speaking to Mueller—at the risk of perjuring himself—and calling in a Saturday morning statement on the Justice Department to “bring an end” to its “manufactured” Russia probe. Asked Thursday at a China trade event at the White House whether he was still willing to speak to Mueller, the president responded, “Yes, I would like to.” Given the recent addition of the combative diGenova to Trump’s team, it is not clear that Dowd’s departure will substantially impact its overall strategy.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) during the Keating Five Scandal, and for leading a Major League Baseball investigation of gambling allegations surrounding baseball great Pete Rose. Jay Sekulow, who has been handling public communications and research on constitutional issues for the Trump legal team, declined on Thursday to answer questions about how the president’s attorneys would be organized going forward. “John Dowd has been a valuable member of our legal team and we will continue our ongoing cooperation with the office of special counsel regarding this inquiry,” Sekulow said in a statement to POLITICO. Trump’s legal team has seen remarkable flux, particularly given the stakes for a president who could potentially face impeachment or even indictment over allegations that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin and that he has sought to obstruct justice. Trump insists that such charges have been manufactured by political partisans. The president originally tapped his longtime personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz to represent him in the Justice Department’s Russia probe, which Mueller has led since shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last May. But the New York-based Kasowitz stepped down last summer amid concerns he wasn’t best positioned to tangle with a Washington scandal. While the president continues to speak with Kasowitz, he has mainly relied on Dowd and Sekulow to manage the Russia probe for him as an individual. Washington lawyer Ty Cobb runs the White House’s official response to the investigation with a team of about five aides who draw taxpayer salaries. The changes to the Trump legal team are seen as a bad omen for Cobb, who has been urging cooperation with Mueller. In an interview on Wednesday, former Cobb law partner Robert Bennett called for Cobb to resign in order to preserve his professional reputation. “I hope my friend Ty Cobb will leave the team. He’s not helping himself or his reputation,” Bennett said. Cobb did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has recently been frustrated with his lawyers, who had been giving him a steadily changing series of target completion dates for a Mueller probe that has only appeared to widen in recent weeks to include allegations, seemingly unrelated to Russia, that a consultant for the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates worked with a top GOP fundraiser. On Saturday, Trump tweeted that “the Mueller probe should never have been started,” insisting that “there was no collusion and there was no crime” and branding the investigation a “WITCH HUNT.” It was the first time Trump had specifically mentioned Mueller by name on Twitter — something his lawyers have counseled him to avoid doing. This week he hired diGenova, a fierce critic of the Russia investigation who earlier this year told Fox News that Trump had been framed by the Justice Department and FBI “with a falsely created crime.” Trump’s free-wheeling style has worn on his lawyers. He’s ignored their advice to restrain himself on Twitter and disregarded their counsel that he not discuss details of the probe beyond his legal team. poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201803/1853/1155968404_5756709788001_5756676647001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Legal experts say those are reasons why Trump has struggled to attract the caliber of lawyer that has historically leapt to represent a sitting president. Olson, Robert Giuffra Jr. and Reid Weingarten were among the elite attorneys who declined job offers from Trump last spring, while former George W. Bush attorneys Bill Burck and Emmet Flood rejected overtures for the position ultimately accepted by Cobb. “The notion of saying no to represent the president of the United States is kind of amazing,” said Bennett, a former personal attorney to President Bill Clinton. Trump may not be done looking for lawyers. Flood met with the president earlier this month at the White House, though it’s unclear if that has led to a job offer. The diGenova hiring came days after Dowd issued a Saturday morning statement calling for Mueller’s work to end. “I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” Dowd told the Daily Beast, responding to Sessions’ decision the night before to fire Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director. Dowd initially said he was speaking in his official capacity as Trump’s lawyer. But he later retracted that statement, telling POLITICO he was commenting in his personal capacity. It was one of several instances where Dowd raised eyebrows—and in some cases, drew ridicule—for his public commentary about the Russia probe. Last December, Dowd took blame for a tweet posted on Trump’s account that appeared to admit Trump was aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the FBI before Trump urged Comey to drop the Russia investigation. The tweet puzzled legal experts who said the admission could fuel an obstruction of justice case against Trump. Dowd later argued that Trump could not be found guilty of obstruction of justice because of his role as chief executive under the Constitution, an argument that many legal experts disputed. Both Dowd and Cobb also were embarrassed last summer after a New York Times reporter overheard them speaking about the Russia investigation at a Washington restaurant. Dowd is well-known for his gruff manner, which was on vivid display outside a federal courthouse in 2011 when he told a CNBC camera crew to “get the fuck out of here” before giving the cameraman the middle finger. Asked recently by POLITICO to comment on talks between the president’s lawyers and Mueller’s investigators, Dowd was only somewhat friendlier: “None of your business,” he said. ||||| WASHINGTON — John Dowd resigned on Thursday as President Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation as Mr. Trump signaled that he was prepared to ignore his advice and wanted a sit-down with investigators. After days of uncertainty among the president’s lawyers about their status, Mr. Dowd ultimately broke with Mr. Trump over whether he should agree to be questioned in the inquiry, a person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Dowd viewed an interview as too risky; the president reiterated shortly after Mr. Dowd resigned that he wanted to clear his name. “I would like to,” the president told reporters at the White House when asked about meeting with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. “I would like to.” Mr. Dowd’s departure cleared the way for the president to embrace a more aggressive posture toward the investigation and marked another reshuffling of personnel for Mr. Trump. In the most politically consequential investigation in decades, the president has refashioned his legal team several times, a revolving door that mirrors the high turnover among senior White House and campaign aides. ||||| Update, March 22, 2018: John Dowd, the president’s lead lawyer in the special counsel’s investigation, has resigned. Read the latest, here. WASHINGTON — President Trump’s legal team was poised for a shake-up on Monday, according to two people briefed on the matter, as he openly discussed firing one of his lawyers, another considered resigning and a third — who pushed theories on television that Mr. Trump was framed by the F.B.I. — joined the roster. Mr. Trump has weighed aloud in recent days to close associates whether to dismiss his lawyer Ty Cobb, who had pushed most strongly a strategy of cooperating fully with the special counsel investigation. The president reassured Mr. Cobb that he had no plans to fire him, according to a person who spoke with the president late Monday, in part to prevent a narrative that his team was in disarray after The New York Times began making inquiries. Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, has contemplated leaving his post because he has concluded that he has no control over the behavior of the president, the two people briefed on the matter said. Ignoring his lawyers’ advice, Mr. Trump has reverted to a more aggressive strategy of publicly assailing the inquiry that he initially adopted in the weeks immediately after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed. Now the president has begun attacking Mr. Mueller himself. |||||Summary:","response":"John Dowd, the lead lawyer for President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation, has resigned.

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" After reading the above, is \\"Vietnam has been very irritated\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Contradictory statements by the government of Malaysia have irritated what country involved with the investigation?\\"? Choose your answer from: [a]. no. [b]. yes.","response":"[a]. no."},{"question":"Haviland is a city in Kiowa County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 701. It is home of Barclay College and known for meteorite finds connected to the Haviland Crater and for an annual meteorite festival held in July. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? People have made various meteorite finds in Haviland.","response":"Yes, based on the paragraph you provided, we can conclude that the statement \\"People have made various meteorite finds in Haviland\\" is true. Haviland, Kansas, is indeed noted for meteorite finds, which are presumably connected to the Haviland Crater. This conclusion is drawn based on the information which states Haviland is known for meteorite finds. This suggests that meteorites have been found in the area, probably more than once given the use of the generic term \\"finds\\". When it's mentioned that something the city is \\"known for\\", that generally implies a repeated or consistent occurrence over time, hence we can conclude multiple finds have been made. Additionally, the city celebrates an annual meteorite festival in July. Such an event would likely not occur unless there was a significant amount of interest in meteorites in the area, which would presumably be driven by local finds. The festival may include various activities related to meteorites, which again indicates that more than one meteorite has been found in Haviland. Moreover, the presence of the Haviland Crater suggests past meteor impacts, which further substantiates the likelihood of numerous meteorite finds in the city. The fact that the city also hosts the Barclay College may also contribute to meteorite research or discoveries given that universities often conduct scientific studies in the locales nearby. In conclusion, based on information provided, we can definitely affirm that Haviland has been a site of various meteorite finds, although the exact number, types, and sizes of these meteorites are not specified in the paragraph."},{"question":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.
