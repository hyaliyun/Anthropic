Disinfecting surfaces and wearing masks have also been crucial in reducing the spread of the virus. In stores, shelves emptied rapidly as people stocked up on disinfectants and sanitizers. Consequently, this shortage led to many people looking for alternative disinfectants, like alcohol and bleach, to use them in different proportions. Hypothesis: Mixing alcohol and bleach is an effective and safe alternative for creating a disinfectant solution for use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Step 1: Define the hypothesis and the problem it aims to address. The hypothesis suggests that mixing alcohol and bleach can provide a safe and efficient disinfectant solution to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic, targeting the issue of shortages in commercial disinfectants. Step 2: Research the components of the hypothesis (i.e., alcohol and bleach). Alcohol, specifically isopropyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol above 70%, is known for having disinfectant properties. Bleach, on the other hand, has sodium hypochlorite, which is also a proven disinfectant. Step 3: Identify what happens when alcohol and bleach are mixed. Researching the reaction between alcohol and bleach, it becomes evident that mixing them produces dangerous chemical byproducts such as hydrochloric acid, chlorine gas, and chloroform. These substances are hazardous and pose health risks. Step 4: Compare the results of mixing alcohol and bleach with the original hypothesis. From the research, it becomes clear that mixing alcohol and bleach generates harmful substances, which contradicts the original hypothesis of creating a safe and effective disinfectant solution. Step 5: Determine the validity of the hypothesis. Since mixing alcohol and bleach results in harmful byproducts, the hypothesis is not valid. It is not a safe nor effective alternative for creating a disinfectant solution during the COVID-19 pandemic, and individuals should not attempt to mix these two substances. Instead, they should use recommended commercial disinfectants or follow guidelines provided by health authorities for safe homemade alternatives."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who constantly plays the song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen? , can you please find it?

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men.

The lack of information makes it difficult for readers to understand the specific issues the reviewer may have encountered or the reasoning behind their negative experience. Brevity alone does not necessarily mean a low rating; however, without any context or explanation, it is challenging for potential customers to evaluate the usefulness of the review. 2. Subjectivity: The reviewer uses subjective language, such as \\"useless\\" and \\"just for geeks,\\" which may indicate personal bias. Potential customers might want to understand more about the exact features or aspects of the product or service that were seen as unfavorable, rather than just the reviewer's personal feelings. 3. Lack of Constructiveness: The review does not offer any suggestions for improvement or specific, actionable feedback that the company or future customers could use to address the reviewer's concerns. Constructive criticism is more valuable because it can help companies improve their products or services and help potential customers make more informed decisions.

It is understood that Fulham offered £7.5million for Morrison and midfield partner Mo Diame, which was dismissed by West Ham, who value Morrison alone at £10m.

In response to the accusations, the Premier League is expected to launch an investigation into the matter to determine if Fulham and Rene Meulensteen indeed violated league rules regarding tapping up a player and making the bid public. Should they be found guilty, Fulham could face sanctions, including potential fines and other punitive measures, designed to deter any club from engaging in similar actions in the future. West Ham's determination to protect their interests in Ravel Morrison is seen as a clear indication of the club's regard for the talented 20-year-old midfielder. They believe that Morrison is a crucial asset to the team, both in the present and moving forward. With a valuation of £10 million for Morrison alone, West Ham has demonstrated their unwillingness to part with the player for anything less than their asking price. Fulham, on the other hand, will likely defend their actions and dispute West Ham's claims of wrongdoing. They may argue that they made a legitimate bid for the players and that any potential discussions regarding the transfer with Morrison were within legal boundaries. Furthermore, they could emphasize that Meulensteen's public comments were not intended to unsettle the player but merely to express Fulham's interest in signing Morrison. In the meantime, Ravel Morrison may find himself in an uncomfortable position, caught between two clubs in a bitter dispute. While West Ham fights to protect their asset and uphold league rules, Fulham may continue to pursue the player in the hopes of bolstering their squad. Ultimately, the outcome of the Premier League's investigation will have a significant impact on the player's future, as well as the relationship between the two clubs."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.

For the purposes of providing a detailed and long answer, we will focus on the following key points: humanitarian grounds for debt relief, economic rebuilding and sustainable development, global political and moral obligations, and long-term improvements for disaster preparedness and resilience. 1. Humanitarian Grounds for Debt Relief: The most immediate reason to argue in favor of debt relief for disaster-stricken nations is on humanitarian grounds. Natural disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods often result in massive displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of life. By providing debt relief, the international community would be essentially providing much-needed funding for rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts. Rather than diverting funds to pay off debt, affected countries could direct resources towards addressing the significant challenges faced by their citizens, including access to clean water, food, shelter, and healthcare. 2. Economic Rebuilding and Sustainable Development: Natural disasters can be a significant setback for the economic development of a country. The destruction of infrastructure, loss of agricultural lands, and disruptions in businesses can hinder economic progress, leading to a decline in GDP, increased poverty, and reduced investor confidence. Debt relief would help free up the necessary funds for affected countries to not only rebuild their economies but also invest in sustainable development projects that could make them more resilient to future disasters. For example, investments in renewable energy, disaster-resilient infrastructure, and early warning systems could reduce the impact of future natural disasters, benefiting both the country and the global community. 3. Global Political and Moral Obligations: Supporters of debt relief for disaster-stricken nations argue that the global community has a moral obligation to help those nations recover, especially given that the impacts of natural disasters can be intensified due to climate change. As developed nations have historically contributed more greenhouse gas emissions, they bear responsibility for the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. Providing debt relief is one way the global community can redress the imbalance and fulfill its responsibility to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable countries. Moreover, doing so can also promote global solidarity and cooperation. 4. Long-term Improvements for Disaster Preparedness and Resilience: Debt relief can enable affected countries to enhance their capacities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters. With additional funds available, countries could implement comprehensive disaster risk reduction programs, strengthen local capacities for emergency response, and undertake the necessary rebuilding and redevelopment with a focus on resilience. As a result, countries receiving debt relief would be in a better position to face future disasters, reducing the likelihood of needing further financial assistance. In conclusion, proponents of debt relief for countries suffering from natural disasters argue that it is not only a compassionate response to the immediate needs of those affected but also an investment in long-term recovery and resilience. By providing debt relief, the international community can foster unity, address its moral and political obligations, and create a safer and more resilient global society for everyone."},{"question":"Choose your answer from options.

With the advent of digital technologies and the increasing availability of the internet, online learning has become a prevalent method of education for people worldwide. While many individuals rely on online learning platforms for expanding their knowledge and acquiring new skills, others argue that traditional in-person learning remains more effective. As the demand for flexible and remote learning opportunities continues to grow, it is crucial to analyze online education's efficacy compared to traditional in-person learning. Hypothesis: Online learning is more effective than traditional in-person learning. To test this hypothesis, the effectiveness of online learning and traditional in-person learning must be evaluated on the following parameters: 1. Accessibility: Online learning platforms can be accessed by individuals worldwide, eliminating geographical constraints faced by those enrolled in traditional, in-person learning. Furthermore, online learning accommodates different learning styles and allows users to proceed at their own pace. 2. Cost-effectiveness: As online learning often has lower overhead costs and does not require physical learning spaces, tuition fees are typically more affordable compared to traditional in-person learning. Additionally, individuals seeking online education can save on expenses related to transportation, housing, and other costs by participating in remote learning. 3. Engagement and collaboration: Online learning platforms may provide more opportunities for student engagement and collaboration through various multimedia content, such as videos, interactive modules, and online discussions. However, it can be argued that in-person learning offers a more focused environment, with immediate feedback from educators and peers. 4. Adaptability: Online learning platforms can be updated quickly to reflect the latest information, providing an advantage over traditional in-person learning, where curriculum updates can take longer to implement. 5. Retention and outcomes: The effectiveness of online learning vs. in-person learning must be assessed based on learning outcomes and retention. Comparisons of test scores, graduation rates, and other measurable outcomes can be used to determine which method is more conducive to students' success. To confirm or refute the hypothesis, further research should be conducted through empirical studies, including both qualitative and quantitative data collection. This can involve examining the experiences and learning outcomes of students participating in online and traditional in-person learning environments. Surveys, interviews, and data analysis could be used to gather insight into students' perceptions of online learning and their self-reported learning experiences and outcomes. In conclusion, the hypothesis that online learning is more effective than traditional in-person learning warrants in-depth investigation and analysis to determine the most efficient and successful learning methods for individuals worldwide. Evaluating accessibility, cost-effectiveness, engagement and collaboration, adaptability, and learning outcomes through extensive research will be crucial in validating the hypothesis and providing valuable guidance to educators, learners, and policymakers."},{"question":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

It's important to examine the words, context, and possible interpretations in order to provide a detailed and long answer. Firstly, let's break down the sentence into its individual words: 1. \\"spirited\\": This word has several meanings, and in this context, it likely refers to a film that is lively, energetic, or animated. It generally implies enthusiasm, passion, and a strong overall presence, which can be associated with positive emotions and experiences. The word \\"spirited\\" can also suggest a certain level of boldness or courage, as it might be used to describe someone who stands up for their beliefs or fights for a cause. This characteristic is often admired and appreciated, adding to the overall positive sentiment of the sentence. 2. \\"film\\": The term \\"film\\" itself is neutral, as it simply refers to a motion picture or movie. Its connotation depends on the context and the words that surround it. When paired with a positive descriptor like \\"spirited,\\" it amplifies the overall optimistic sentiment. Now, let's consider the possible interpretations of the sentence: 1. If the sentence is an independent statement, it indicates that the speaker or writer is positively describing a film they have watched or heard about. They appreciate the lively, energetic, or animated aspects of the film, which contribute to a positive viewing experience. 2. If the sentence is part of a larger context, for instance in a conversation or a written review, it still conveys a positive sentiment. It suggests that the person is recommending the film or highlighting its positive qualities. In the context of a review, this statement might be followed by more specific observations or examples that support the positive claim. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"spirited film\\" is positive, as it alludes to a movie that possesses lively, energetic, or animated qualities that evoke a sense of passion, enthusiasm, and enjoyment for the viewer. This positive sentiment emerges both from the individual words and their combined meaning within different contexts."},{"question":"Attributes: name = Cotto, food = French, customer rating = 3 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes, near = Ranch.

He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy, \\"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\\"Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more.

All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. 632). After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later 7th century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711.

Of course, that force is gravity. How many forces do you have on you right now? Gravity pulls you down toward the center of Earth. Your legs exert a downward force. They hold you up against the pull of gravity. Consider the example in Figure 1.3. A book is resting on a table. Gravity pulls the book downward. It has a force of 20 newtons. At the same time, the table pushes the book upward. Its force is also 20 newtons. The table opposes the pull of gravity.

First of all, this movie attempts \\"serious\\" science-fiction, social commentary, more than action-adventure. There is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. If you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad \\"Aliens\\" clone. But, again, that's not what it's about. The movie is really about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly *back*). But because it's not trying to give you a typically glib Hollywood style answer, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. And he really does a wonderful job--it can take two viewings to appreciate it. The surrounding \\"social logic\\" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for Russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.

He was primarily known as a guitarist. He also played the mandolin, fiddle, banjo, and ukulele. Atkins's signature picking style was inspired by Merle Travis. After dropping out of high school in 1942, Atkins landed a job at WNOX-AM radio in Knoxville, where he played fiddle and guitar with the singer Bill Carlisle and the comic Archie Campbell and became a member of the station's Dixieland Swingsters, a small swing instrumental combo. After three years, he moved to WLW-AM in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Merle Travis had formerly worked. After six months, he moved to Raleigh and worked with Johnnie and Jack before heading for Richmond, Virginia, where he performed with Sunshine Sue Workman. Atkins's shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly \\"country\\". He was fired often, but was soon able to land another job at another radio station on account of his unique playing ability. Atkins and Jethro Burns (of Homer and Jethro) married twin sisters, Leona and Lois Johnson, who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson, the Johnson Sisters. Leona Atkins outlived her husband by eight years, dying in 2009 at the age of 85. Travelling to Chicago, Atkins auditioned for Red Foley, who was leaving his star position on WLS-AM's National Barn Dance to join the Grand Ole Opry. Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based Bullet Records that year. That single, \\"Guitar Blues\\", was fairly progressive, including a clarinet solo by the Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan, with Owen Bradley on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry, but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to KWTO in Springfield, Missouri.

Q: Article: Housing Price in China has always aroused heated discussion among property developers and ordinary Chinese. To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles in Chinese real estate market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers. Meanwhile, the government should allow people to build more houses through various fund-raising channels, such as funds collected from buyers or raised by working units. By applying these multiple means, it is expected that the high housing prices can be lowered and Chinese public can really benefit from the economic achievement.

Before he rose to fame as a recording artist, Richardson gained notoriety by breaking the world record for continuous on-air broadcasting, staying on air for 122 hours and 8 minutes from May 6 to May 10, 1957, sometimes even broadcasting from a makeshift studio in a local drive-in theater. The Big Bopper's signature song, \\"Chantilly Lace,\\" was released in 1958, and it became one of the most popular hits of that period. The song showcased his unique vocal style, with Richardson talking and singing in a playful, distinctive manner. The catchy tune and lyrics, combined with his lively stage presence, cemented the Big Bopper's place in music history. Besides \\"Chantilly Lace,\\" he also wrote and recorded other songs such as \\"White Lightning,\\" which later became a No.1 country hit for George Jones, and \\"Running Bear,\\" which became a chart-topping hit for Johnny Preston in 1959. Tragically, The Big Bopper's meteoric rise came to an abrupt halt on February 3, 1959, when he perished in a plane crash, along with fellow rock and roll pioneers Ritchie Valens and Buddy Holly. This catastrophic event was later dubbed \\"The Day the Music Died\\" in Don McLean's 1971 song \\"American Pie.\\" The incident occurred during the \\"Winter Dance Party\\" tour, which covered 24 cities in a short span of three weeks. Tired of the grueling travel conditions and spurred by Holly's decision to charter a plane, Richardson decided to take a seat on the flight initially meant for Waylon Jennings, who was a member of Holly's band at the time. Ritchie Valens, who also found a seat on that unfortunate flight, had switched places with Tommy Allsup by winning a coin toss. Although The Big Bopper's career was short-lived, his music, particularly \\"Chantilly Lace,\\" remains an essential part of rock and roll history. An innovator who straddled the boundaries between country and rock music, his influence can still be felt to this day. Richardson was posthumously inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, forever cementing his legacy as a significant figure in the early years of rock and roll."},{"question":"By. Louise Boyle. PUBLISHED:. 09:41 EST, 24 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 16:43 EST, 24 October 2012. Convicted murderer and Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel has been denied parole, a decade after being given a life sentence for beating his teenage neighbor to death with a golf club. Skakel's request was rejected following a two-hour hearing on Wednesday in which he proclaimed his innocence. The chair of the parole board at the Connecticut prison, Erika. Tindill, said it was odd for Skakel to ask for early release while. proclaiming he is innocent. Freedom bid: Convicted murderer Michael Skakel has appealed for his release today in Connecticut but failed. The victim's mother, Dorothy Moxley, said during the hearing in Suffield that Skakel should serve at least 20 years. Skakel told the board that it 'is not an easy question to answer' as to whether he should be paroled, according to the Hartford Courant. He added that he knew the best chance of being paroled was for him to admit to the crime. Robert F. Kennedy Jr had appealed for. his cousin's release, saying in a letter that Skakel is a model inmate. and devoted to God. Skakel has submitted 65 letters in support of his. release. Skakel, 52, spoke slowly and softly. during the hearing at McDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in. Suffield, Connecticut saying: 'I did not commit this crime.' Other. Kennedys have rallied around their relative, claiming that his trial. was a miscarriage of justice. However relatives of 15-year-old murder. victim Martha Moxley say Skakel has shown no remorse and should remain. in prison for the rest of his life. Long walk back: Despite the parole hearing, Skakel was returned to his prison cell today to continue serving his life sentence. Skakel said on Wednesday that he prays every day that whoever committed the crime is brought to justice, but he is the wrong man. 'If I could ease Mrs. Moxley's pain in any way, shape or form I would take responsibility all day long for this crime,' Skakel said. He added: 'I cannot bear false witness against myself.' The heavyset, 52-year-old Skakel with gray, thinning hair wore a beige prison jumpsuit to the hearing. To support his claims of innocence, he told of how he became sober. 'I pose to you: how can a guilty man stay sober for 30 years with that kind of guilt on his mind?' he said. Skakel, convicted in 2002, is eligible for parole consideration because of laws in place at the time of the crime including good behavior credits. Supporter: Robert F Kennedy Jr has appealed for his cousin Michael Skakel's release. In letters to the parole board, Skakel's supporters, including his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said Skakel has helped alcoholics recover. They also portray him as religious and devoted to his son. Many letters cite Skakel's art work in prison, saying he has made uplifting paintings that show his true nature, give joy to others and encourage family values. Letters objecting to his parole cite the brutal nature of the crime and say releasing him early would be devastating to the victim's family. 'This person committed a heinous crime that gave many people a sentence of suffering that was irreversible,' one of the letters states. 'Why then should this person be given relief, when none is available for those who suffered the loss of a daughter, a sister, a dear friend.' On Tuesday, Skakel filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN television host Nancy Grace and Tru-TV host Beth Karas, alleging they made false statements about evidence of Skakel's DNA near the crime scene. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Stamford, also named media companies Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting as defendants. Skakel. was sentenced to 20 years to life for beating Martha Moxley to death. with a golf club in 1975 in Greenwich when they were 15-year-old. neighbors. Skakel is a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel. Kennedy. Martha Moxley was just 15-years-old when she was brutally murdered close to her home in Connecticut. 'There's never been a person more deserving of parole than Michael Skakel,' his attorney, Hope Seeley, said in a statement. Michael Skakel was only 15 at the time his 15-year-old neighbor Martha Moxley was beaten to death with a golf club in 1975. Skakel was arrested 25 years later in 2000. He was finally indicted for murder afer a 1998 book written about the events of that night suggested Michael had been at the scene. He had said he was at his cousin's house at the time of the murder. However, Michael later admitted that he had been masturbating in the tree house on the night before the victim's remains were found in the same spot. Two former students of Elan, a boarding. school where Skakel had been sent for alcohol addiction treatment in his late teens, also. testified that Skakel had confessed to Miss Moxley's murder. Other reports suggested that Skakel was jealous of his brother, Thomas's relationship with Miss Moxley. Thomas had long been considered a murder suspect. According to former neighbor Gregory Coleman, Michael Skakel had bragged: 'I'm going to get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.' Michael Skakel is the nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel. Kennedy. On June 6, 1968, Senator Kennedy was assassinated by a shooter in LA following his victory in the Californian presidential primary. David Kennedy, his son, died of a Demerol and cocaine overdose in a Florida hotel room in 1984, having battled addiction for many years. Michael Kennedy, another son of RFK, died during a skiing accident in Aspen when some family members were playing football while on skis and not wearing helmets. He crashed into a tree during the December 1997 incident and died. It happened shortly after his family's babysitter claimed he had a sexual relationship with her when she was 14. 'His track record during the past 10. years shows the person we all know him to be - caring, generous and. committed to his faith, family and friends. 'His. conviction was a miscarriage of justice, but that aside, his further. incarceration would also be a miscarriage of justice in light of the. fact that he should have been sentenced as a juvenile.' Skakel has lost appeals challenging his conviction that raised the juvenile issue and other claims. He. last appeared in court in January 2011, asking for his sentence to be. shortened. A three-judge panel rejected the request, saying it was. 'unjust and excessive'. At. the appearance, Skakel continued to maintain his innocence, telling the. court: 'I didn't commit this crime... give me a polygraph. I pray for. Mrs Moxley every single day.' Martha Moxley's mother, Dorthy, and. brother, John, want him kept in prison for life. Skakel has shown no. remorse, John Moxley said. 'Michael. Skakel is representative of the most dangerous aspect of our society in. that he was raised in an environment in which he was exposed to and at. some point embraced the mindset that the rules of our general society. did not then and do not now apply to him,' Moxley wrote in a letter to. the parole board. 'And,. I believe that Michael Skakel's inbred sense of self and his. self-confessed quick temper will always represent a threat to society.' He said the murder continues to haunt him. 'No. child should ever have to witness the pain I have seen my parents go. through, which I know in my heart contributed to my father's early. death,' Mr Moxley wrote. Asked about the impact of the crime, Mr Moxley added: 'When you lose a loved one, it just never goes away.' The state Supreme Court ruled in 2010. against Skakel's bid for a new trial, saying a claim implicating two. other men in the killing wasn't credible. The. U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Skakel has a habeas corpus. appeal pending in state courts, accusing his trial attorney, Michael. Sherman, of doing a poor job, a claim Sherman has rejected. Daddy's girl: Martha, pictured with her father David Moxley. Her brother John said he believes her murder contributed to his father's early death. Thomas Skakel, left, was going out with Martha Moxley in 1975 and young Michael, right, was alleged to be jealous. Skakel, who was arrested in 2000, has not had any disciplinary issues in prison, said Brian Garnett, spokesman for the state Department of Correction. 'Does Michael deserve to be paroled? Michael doesn't deserve to have been locked away for the last 10 years because he is innocent,' his brother John Skakel wrote in a letter to the parole board. 'But through this horrendous decade, Michael has been a model inmate and has chosen to use this time constructively.'

He was given a life sentence and has been in prison for a long time. Recently, he tried to ask for parole, which is when someone is released from prison early for good behavior. However, the parole board decided not to let him out. Michael Skakel is related to a famous political family, the Kennedys. Some people think he did not get a fair trial and believe he is innocent. During the hearing, Michael said he did not commit the crime and would take responsibility if it would help the victim's family.

It usually takes 1-3 weeks for the test results to come back, but your doctor should be able to give you a more accurate estimate. Ask them if you can expect them to call you or if the results will be posted in an online chart for you to view.If you don’t hear back within 3 weeks, call your doctor’s office and ask about the results. Most of the time, pap smear test results come back normal. Sometimes, however, you might get a result of “abnormal” or “unclear.” If this happens, don’t worry! Even an abnormal test result doesn’t necessarily mean that anything is seriously wrong. Talk to your doctor about scheduling a follow-up appointment for further tests. In rare cases, abnormal cells in a pap smear can be a sign of cancer in your cervix or uterus. If your doctor suspects that your test results might indicate a serious problem, they may have you come in for more tests, like a colonoscopy or a biopsy (tissue sample). Sometimes, your doctor will recommend that you wait 6 months to a year and then have another pap smear done. If the abnormal cells are still there or if they see major changes since your last exam, they might decide to do further testing. How often you need to get a pap smear depends on a lot of things, such as your age, your medical history, and how high your risk is for problems like cervical cancer or sexually transmitted infections. Work with your doctor to figure out the best time for you to come in for your next routine pap smear and pelvic exam. Most doctors recommend that you get your first pap smear at age 21, and then follow up every 3 years (or more often if there are abnormal results). Once you’re 30, you can reduce the frequency to once every 5 years unless you have an abnormal pap smear. You can stop having pap smears by the time you’re 65 to 70 as long as you’ve had 3 normal tests within the last 10 years.

The premise focuses on an individual wearing a pink shirt while riding a brown horse in a rodeo, whereas the hypothesis talks about an outfielder waiting to catch a flyball for the final out presumably in a baseball game. Since both sentences are describing separate events, there is no direct connection between the premise and the hypothesis that would allow us to determine if the hypothesis is true or false. To elaborate, the premise is set in the context of a rodeo, which is a competitive equestrian sport that primarily includes events such as riding, roping, and racing. The individual described as wearing a pink shirt might be participating in a specific event within the rodeo like barrel racing or bareback riding. These events require a certain level of athleticism, horsemanship, and skill from both the participant and the horse. Therefore, the main focus of the premise is the performance of the horse and rider in this particular context. On the other hand, the hypothesis is set in the context of a baseball game. The mention of an outfielder indicates the specific position that the person is playing on the field, which is responsible for catching and fielding balls that are hit towards the outfield. The hypothesis also implies that the game might be nearing its end since the outfielder is waiting for the flyball for the final out. Baseball is a sport that requires a strong teamwork strategy, physical skills, and mental alertness. The main focus in this hypothesis is the completion of the baseball game, which is unfolding independently from the rodeo described in the premise. In conclusion, there is no information in the premise to support or refute the hypothesis because they both describe separate events, settings, and subjects without any direct connection between them. To determine the accuracy of the hypothesis, we would require additional premises or information specific to the baseball game being discussed. Similarly, if we want to gain further insight into the rodeo event, we need additional information about the performance of the pink-shirted rider and their brown horse."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of strings and you need to concatenate them.

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.

How many horses are there total? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"We'll go step-by-step as follows: 1. There are 3 blue horses given. 2. There are three times as many purple horses as blue horses. Since there are 3 blue horses, there must be 3 * 3 = 9 purple horses. 3. There are twice as many green horses as purple horses. Since there are 9 purple horses, there must be 2 * 9 = 18 green horses. 4. There are 1/6th as many gold horses as green horses. Since there are 18 green horses, there must be 18 / 6 = 3 gold horses. Now, let's add the number of horses in each color group to find the total number of horses: Blue: 3 Purple: 9 Green: 18 Gold: 3 Total number of horses: 3 + 9 + 18 + 3 = 33 horses."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

All the given facts are expressed in natural language. Your job is to generate a story 100 to 1000 words long, that includes all the facts given as input in their order of appearance while expanding upon them to produce a broader, yet coherent, narrative. Input: Fact1: Terri Fletcher is teenager with passion for singing and dreams of becoming professional singer, Fact2: Terri is close to elder brother, Fact3: Paul At has fight with Simon Paul 's graduation-day barbecue, Fact4: Robin Childers was involved with Jay previous summer, Fact5: Simon flies to Los Angeles to bring Terri home in effort to keep safe Output:","response":"Terri Fletcher was a teenager who had an innate passion for singing. At every opportunity, she would let her voice soar and dance along with the ambient sounds of her world. She dreamt of one day becoming a professional singer, standing on the stage as the audience listened to every note she sang and every lyric she penned. However, life as a teenager often proved chaotic, and Terri found her rock in the close relationship she shared with her elder brother Paul. Paul, despite being older, understood Terri's passion and encouraged her every step of the way. Together, they would practice and rehearse for hours, getting lost in the melodies they created. Paul knew his sister had a talent that needed to be appreciated and Terri was grateful for having such a supportive brother. One day, Paul's friend, Simon, invited them to his graduation-day barbecue. Friends and family gathered at the venue to celebrate Simon's accomplishment and the air was filled with laughter and the aroma of sizzling barbecue. Terri tagged along with her brother, as she relished the opportunity to spend more time with him. However, amidst the good vibes, a storm was brewing. Paul did not get along well with Simon's acquaintance, Robin Childers. They had had a falling out over Robin's previous relationship with Jay the previous summer. Robin's reputation as a troublemaker was widespread and Paul did not want Robin's drama-filled life to seep into his or Terri's. He was afraid that Robin could jeopardize Terri's dream. As the evening wore on, tensions escalated between Paul and Robin. Eventually, it culminated into a nasty altercation that caused the celebratory vibe to sour. Concerned for her brother's well-being and her own safety, Terri quietly slipped away from the festivities and retreated to her safe space -her home studio. It was just the two of them in their small abode, their parents away for the weekend, so Terri felt a strange, unnameable sense of unease creeping up on her as she sang alone in the room. Soon, Paul managed to compose himself after the fight and return home. Upon noticing Terri's withdrawal from the event and the somber mood that weighed over her, Paul knew he had to do something drastic to ensure his sister's safety and mental well-being. He placed a call to Simon, asking for help in sensitive yet unresolved situation. And so, Simon decided to fly to Los Angeles with Terri, hoping to take her away from the negative environment and provide her with an opportunity to focus on her dreams. He had connections in the music industry and remembered fondly how Terri had sung at the party earlier, realizing the potential in her voice. Simon believed that by pulling Terri away from the drama and into a city full of dream-chasers, she would have the chance to turn her dreams into reality, surrounded by a supportive network that extended beyond her brother. Paul, understanding that sometimes one has to let go of those closest to them for their growth, grudgingly agreed to let Terri leave with Simon. He trusted Simon to take care of her and swore to visit her in Los Angeles as often as he could. When Terri arrived in Los Angeles, she was immediately overtaken by the swirl of energy that the city carried. She felt the magnetic pull of her dreams and her heart filled with hope. In this city of angels and dreamers, she could feel the love of her brother from miles away, believing in her and supporting her dreams, as she let her voice rise and pierce through the noise. And though they were far apart, they would continue to share a bond that would only grow stronger as Terri pursued her dreams in the city that never slept."},{"question":"FINAL EXAM Question 1. A bolo punch is to martial arts as a hook is to? A:","response":"A hook is to boxing A bolo punch is a type of punch used in various martial arts, particularly in Filipino martial arts. It is characterized by a pendulum-like motion of the striking arm, which makes it deceptive and powerful. It was popularized by Filipino boxer Ceferino Garcia in the 1930s and has been adopted by many martial artists and boxers since then. On the other hand, a hook is a fundamental punch in the sport of boxing. It is a short-to-medium range punch typically thrown with the lead hand or rear hand in a semi-circular motion to strike the opponent's head or body. This type of punch is designed to come around the opponent's guard, utilizing the rotational force generated from the hips and legs to deliver a powerful blow. Both the bolo punch and the hook punch are techniques that can inflict significant damage when executed properly. They both rely on the rotational force generated by the body to create power and can be used to surprise and break through an opponent's defenses. However, the primary difference between the two lies in their origins and the specific techniques that define them. The bolo punch, coming from Filipino martial arts, is often used as a feint to mask other attacks or counterattacks. While the bolo punch can be thrown as a whipping or circular motion, its primary purpose is strategic deception. Martial artists may use the bolo punch to distract their opponents, making them focus on one point while leaving openings for other attacks. On the other hand, the hook is deeply ingrained in the sport of boxing as one of its fundamental punches, along with the jab, cross, and uppercut. It is often taught to beginners and is considered an essential component of a boxer's repertoire. A well-executed hook relies on proper hip and leg rotation, a tight guard, sharp focus, and the use of the opponent's centerline as a target. In conclusion, though the bolo punch and hook punch might share some similarities, they actually represent different techniques and traditions within their respective martial arts and boxing disciplines. The bolo punch is commonly associated with Filipino martial arts and serves as a strategic and deceptive technique. In contrast, the hook punch is a boxing staple that derives its power from body rotation and precise targeting when properly executed."},{"question":"Q: Which of these sentences doesn't make sense?

Bernice King and her brother Martin Luther King III say Dexter King took funds from their father's estate. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued their brother Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting \\"substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America\\" for his own use, according to the lawsuit. Also named as a defendant is the Martin Luther King Jr. estate, which is incorporated. Dexter King is the corporation's president and chief executive, in addition to being the estate's administrator. The three are the only shareholders in the corporation, and the plaintiffs hold at least 20 percent of its outstanding shares. The lawsuit contends Dexter King illegally and fraudulently converted estate funds and should be forced to repay the money and reimburse the plaintiffs' legal costs. The document, which lists five counts, does not say how much he is accused of taking. Dexter King has denied the accusations. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. The three are the only surviving children of Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968, and Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. Their oldest child, Yolanda King, died in 2007. Bernice King administers her mother's estate. In a countersuit, Dexter King has asked a judge to force Bernice King to turn over their mother's personal papers, including love letters central to a now-defunct 1.4 million book deal. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King complained that Dexter King refused to hold shareholders meetings, which they said was another example of his lack of transparency in handling their father's estate. There had been no shareholders' meeting of the corporation since 2004, something that Dexter King blamed on the distraction caused by the deaths of his mother and sister. Judge Ural D. Glanville ordered a meeting, which was held last week. In a hearing held in late September, Glanville, who will preside over the trial in Fulton County Superior Court, also expressed serious concern about governance of the King estate. The judge issued an order saying \\"the court is extremely troubled.\\" He noted that Dexter King, as the majority shareholder, wields significant power in the corporation because he holds 80 percent of its shares. He alone can constitute a quorum for transacting business, the order says. The judge warned all three Kings that any failure to comply with the Georgia Corporation Code could result in the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of a receiver.","response":"The trial between two of Martin Luther King Jr.'s children and their brother Dexter King is set to begin with jury selection on Monday.

The US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Britain are among those with no national ID card. However, some of the countries have ID cards for particular uses. For example, Australia and the United States use a driving licence to identify people. Identity cards are introduced for a variety of reasons. Race, politics and religion were often at the heart of older ID systems.

Boehner. Pessimism mounted among members of the committee about their ability to strike a deal by Monday and avert a high-profile failure that would demonstrate anew the inability of the two parties on Capitol Hill to reach consensus about how to attack the nation’s mounting public debt. The partisan divide was also showcased Friday by a vote in the House to reject a Republican-backed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. Despite time running out on the committee created by the summer agreement to raise the federal debt limit, negotiations were in disarray, with Republicans and Democrats even disputing what precisely divided them. One panel member said that he still had slim hope for a deal but that it would take an extraordinary development to end the stalemate and avoid a series of automatic cuts in 2013 that would reduce federal services and make substantial reductions in Pentagon spending. Seeking to reach at least a partial accord, Republicans made their six Democratic counterparts on the committee an offer that would get to roughly half of its goal — a retreat for an earlier plan with cuts in spending and revenue increases — but Democrats rejected it out of hand as inadequate. Democrats said the proposal was unbalanced because it was overly dependent on spending cuts with only a small amount of new revenue. “If they maintain this,” said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a Democratic member of the committee, in an interview, “then this is not going to happen.” Mr. Boehner, stepping in to the talks as the deadline neared, helped devise the Republican proposal, which offered less in new revenues than a previous Republican plan. But Republicans said the proposal also would not touch Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, so they said they were surprised it was spurned. Mr. Boehner left town on Friday pessimistic that a deal could be made by the Monday evening deadline, his aides said. “This was a balanced, bipartisan plan,” said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. “The fact that it was rejected makes it clear that Washington Democrats won’t cut a dime in government spending without job-killing tax hikes.” Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the committee, said in an interview that he still had hope, but that “we’re really having a hard time bringing our colleagues to what is fair, what is balanced.” Aides to lawmakers in both parties, speaking anonymously because they did not want to be seen as sabotaging the negotiations, were even more negative. “I do not feel any last-minute sense of urgency,” one said. The group has until Monday to submit a plan to the Congressional Budget Office for evaluation before presenting it to the full Congress on Wednesday, leaving time for reaching the sort of last-minute breakthrough that often occurs on Capitol Hill when lawmakers face a deadline. But members said the divisions were so deep, and good will so lacking, that their expectations were eroding. The divide was further illustrated by the House’s rejection of a constitutional amendment that would generally require the federal government to balance its budget. The House voted 261 to 165 in favor of the proposal, but that was 23 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to advance a constitutional amendment. The vast majority of Republicans supported the measure. Democrats, even some who voted in favor of a similar measure in 1995, pushed it to failure. The dynamic Friday mirrored that of other high-stakes fiscal fights in the 112th Congress, like the brawl last summer over legislation to lift the debt ceiling and avoid default and a fight over a spending measure that was also resolved within hours of a government shutdown. But without an immediate threat of fiscal calamity, as was the case in both those instances, the cuts to federal spending triggered by a committee failure would not take place until 2013, leaving Congress an opportunity to find other escape hatches. Republicans and Democrats provided radically different descriptions of the Republicans’ latest offer, intended to reduce budget deficits by 643 billion over 10 years. Republicans said their proposal called for 229 billion in new revenue and fees, including taxes on owners of corporate jets, and 316 billion in cuts in spending, including 100 billion from the Defense Department. Republicans said these cuts would reduce the need for federal borrowing and thus reduce interest payments on the federal debt by 100 billion over 10 years. Democrats said the amount of tax revenue in the Republicans’ plan — 3 billion from owners of corporate jets — was laughable. Central to the impasse is a fundamental disagreement over how much revenue would be raised toward the 1.2 trillion, and what the role of the Bush-era tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of next year, would play. Republicans want to maintain the cuts; Democrats want them eliminated for the nation’s highest earners. Most members of the committee intend to stay in town over the weekend and continue talking. Half the members are scheduled to appear on the Sunday morning television talk shows, where they will almost certainly have to discuss whether their efforts are doomed. Members of the panel are trying to figure out how to manage the denouement of the panel’s narrative, which began with their first meeting 10 weeks ago. One option is for the panel to meet and vote next week on deficit reduction plans devised by the two parties. However, Congressional leaders are cool to that idea, saying it makes no sense to have the public embarrassment of a meeting that would showcase a failure to solve some of the nation’s biggest problems. ||||| Congressional negotiators made a yet another push Friday to carve 1.2 trillion in savings from the federal debt, but remained stuck in their entrenched positions on tax policy even as the clock was running down on their efforts to reach a deal. Running from one small huddle to the next, lawmakers on the special deficit committee continued trying to reach a compromise before a Wednesday deadline. After that, the panel loses special legislative advantages that could help its recommendations win congressional approval. A series of bipartisan meetings late Thursday night and early Friday produced no breakthroughs, and perhaps the best chance in a generation to tame the government’s swelling debt, now at 15 trillion, continued to slip away. By Friday evening, a sense of gloom enveloped the Capitol, which was nearly completely vacant as members of the House and Senate returned to their states for a week-long Thanksgiving break. Left behind were the dozen members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, Lawmakers and aides said they need a breakthrough by Monday night to leave enough time for getting an official audit of their work from the Congressional Budget Office. Despite the new negotiating setback, Republicans pledged to continue talking. “If an agreement is not reached today, members of the joint select committee, Democrats and Republicans, will meet through the weekend. We are painfully, painfully aware of the deadline that is staring us in the face,” said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), the GOP co-chairman of the committee. As he left the Capitol Friday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) dismissed the latest GOP overture with a smile and a long pause. “I’m going to be available to talk, if they’re willing to put forward something reasonable. If they’re not willing to put forward anything reasonable, there’s no point in talking,” he said. Democrats rejected an offer from Republicans for a limited deal, which could cut the deficit by half of the 1.2 trillion goal. Such an agreement could soften the blow of automatic spending cuts in defense and domestic programs that take effect in 2013 if the panel does not produce a deal on 1.2 trillion in reductions. With little progress in efforts to reach the 1.2 trillion target, Republicans on the “supercommittee” worked with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to develop the more limited plan. Republicans proposed to achieve about 640 billion in savings over the next decade, primarily through cuts to domestic agency budgets, a pay freeze and bigger pension contributions for federal workers, cuts in farm subsidies, an overhaul of the postal service and an array of other spending cuts and revenue raisers. The offer would make no cuts to the Pentagon beyond the pay freeze and attrition of civilian workers and included a tax increase on owners of corporate jets. Many of the provisions gained bipartisan support during negotiations this summer over the debt limit, but Democrats have refused to accept them without matching tax increases. “This was a balanced, bipartisan plan – the fact that it was rejected makes it clear that Washington Democrats won’t cut a dime in government spending without job-killing tax hikes,” said Michael Steel, Boehner’s spokesman. But Democratic aides said the proposal would have replaced sharp cuts to defense — a top political priority for Republicans — with cuts that would affect the middle class and slash spending for Democratic priorities. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), exiting an hour-long meeting of the panel’s six Democrats, rejected the Republican offer for not meeting “any standard of common sense” because it would not raise any revenue from the wealthiest Americans. “We were sent here to do 1.2 trillion or 1.5 trillion or 4 trillion,” Kerry told reporters. “So the idea of Friday, of settling for a half of what the American people need and what we were sent here to do, is unacceptable.” Taxes remained the central dispute between Democrats and Republicans on the committee. The GOP members rallied behind Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick J. Toomey’s proposal to raise roughly 300 billion in new taxes, while also leaving in place the Bush-era tax cuts approved in 2001 and 2003. Democrats were willing to negotiate over the GOP proposal, but they objected to leaving the Bush tax breaks in place for the top 2 percent of income earners. If those breaks for the wealthy expired at the end of next year, it would provide an additional 800 billion in revenue over the next decade. “To have something on table that does not ask the wealthiest people in the country to share in it would be unconscionable. This is the divide right now. We’re still working. I hope we can get there, but I don’t know at this point,” Kerry said.

But nobody in Washington expects an eleventh-hour intervention. Text Size - + reset POLITICO 44 Obama hit a low point in his presidency in August when his direct negotiations on a massive deficit-cutting package crumbled, and the country narrowly dodged a debt default. Four months later, as Washington braces for another possible budget breakdown, Obama isn’t likely to engage in any last-minute heroics. The White House insists the circumstances are different this time around. No crisis looms, and the West Wing is confident in the simplicity and soundness of its argument: The supercommittee failed because Republicans chose to shield wealthy Americans from higher taxes. “There is only one reason if, on Nov. 23, the supercommittee didn’t come up with a solution,” White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said in an interview. “It’s because this Republican Party — by the way, in opposition to what most Republicans in the country think — refused to ask millionaires and billionaires and corporations to pay their fair share. It’s the only reason, everything else is spin.” The laissez-faire strategy isn’t without risk. It challenges the age-old adage about presidents getting the blame when things go badly — and Obama, no matter how deft the West Wing has been in insulating him, would receive plenty of it from editorial pages, fiscal hawks, Washington critics and Republicans. And a supercommittee deadlock, which triggers 1.2 trillion in automatic cuts, would spark a fresh set of political problems for Obama in an election year. He would face significant pressure from Congress to void the reductions before January 2013, when they kick in. Republicans vow to roll back as much as 600 billion in Pentagon cuts — and will use the dire warnings from Obama’s own defense secretary, Leon Panetta, against him. “We’ll just run over him,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in an interview. “How can any member of Congress, given the testimony of our military commanders and secretary of defense, vote to cut 600 billion out of the defense department on top of what we’re doing? The president would be eaten alive politically.” Citing Obama’s limited involvement, Republicans accuse him of wanting the panel to collapse because a bipartisan agreement wouldn’t fit his reelection strategy of blaming the GOP for Washington gridlock. The Republican National Committee released a 23-page memo on Thursday, positioning Obama as the impediment. West Wing officials say the charge is absurd. They insist Obama would far prefer a deal because success is always better than failure. At this point, the financial markets would be more surprised by an agreement, giving the economy a lift, and it would remove budget deficits from the election-year debate. ||||| Associated Press Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), co-chair of the supercommittee, tells reporters outside his office that the deficit reduction panel would work over the weekend as the deadline for its work nears, on Capitol Hill in Washington Friday. WASHINGTON—Congress's last-gasp deficit-cut talks broke into two tracks Friday, with members of a special committee continuing to seek an elusive 1.2 trillion deal while party leaders discussed a smaller, backup plan in case they fail. Talk of a Plan B reflected the bleak outlook facing the committee as it heads into its final days. It technically has until Wednesday, but the real deadline is midnight Monday, since members by law need 48 hours to scrutinize any plan before voting on it. Congressional leaders working on the debt committee have started discussing a fallback option of a smaller deficit deal, WSJ Washington bureau chief Jerry Seib reports on the News Hub.

View Interactive Associated Press If Congress falls back to a smaller plan, or stumbles completely, automatic spending cuts would kick in to bring the total deficit cut over 10 years to 1.2 trillion. Such an outcome would be seen as a failure, including by lawmakers who created the committee with the express purpose of hammering out a sweeping deficit-cutting deal that has eluded them all year long. Committee members plan to meet through the weekend. On Friday, some were holed up for hours in the rooms of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is led by Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), a supercommittee member. A growing disappointment gripped the Capitol as reality set in that the hopes of a deal were fading fast, leaving lawmakers likely to return to their districts for the Thanksgiving holiday facing unhappy voters. Congress is stymied over how to launch a new deficit reduction initiative, but one of the biggest obstacles is an old Washington standby: The fate of Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2012. Jerry Seib has details on The News Hub. \\"We are painfully, painfully aware of the deadline that is staring us in the face,\\" said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), co-head of the panel. \\"We have 12 good people who have worked hard since this committee has been created to try to find sufficient common ground.\\" Financial markets have wobbled in recent days, largely because of grim news on the European debt crisis, but also because of the apparent stalemate in Washington. That pressure might force action over the weekend. Some in the markets think a failure could put the U.S. credit rating back on the table. Any attempt by the committee to put off difficult decisions would lack credibility, said Steven Hess, lead analyst on U.S. government debt at Moody's Investors Service. Moody's, which unlike Standard & Poor's still rates U.S. debt triple-A, said the outcome of the deliberations \\"will be informative...but not decisive.\\" Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said Friday the country needs a long-term plan to cut the debt. \\"The bond market will take vengeance unless our elected officials get their act together,\\" he said. Others were less concerned. \\"We've got a 9% approval rating,\\" said Rep. Pat Tiberi (R., Ohio). \\"Most Americans don't believe that we can come up with something anyway, so I don't know that the markets are going to react to us not being able to get the 1.2 trillion.\\" Seeking a backup deal, House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) offered Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) a plan that would cut the deficit by 643 billion but leave out tax increases or cuts to Medicare or Medicaid, items that have proven the most controversial. Enlarge Image Close Getty Images Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus is surrounded by reporters after leaving a meeting with fellow members of the deficit supercommittee in the Capitol on Friday. But the same politics that bedeviled the broader effort are stymieing the smaller one, and Democrats rejected Mr. Boehner's plan, saying it included only 3 billion in tax increases, with the rest from spending cuts and interest savings. Republicans said that mischaracterizes the plan, which they said includes 229 billion in new revenue from various nontax sources, including selling federal properties, selling broadband spectrum and increasing airport security fees. In deference to a longtime Democratic complaint, Republicans threw in a proposal to end a special tax break for corporate-jet owners. Repealing it would raise about 3 billion over 10 years. \\"There was nothing in the package that Democrats could call controversial,\\" said a GOP leadership aide. A Democratic aide called the proposal \\"laughable and disappointing.\\" A Democratic aide called the effort an informal \\"spitballing\\" of ideas. Much of the negotiation has progressed this way, full of smoke and obfuscation, with the sides disagreeing even on what has been proposed. Friday's recriminations signaled how far apart they remain. If there is no deal or a partial one, automatic cuts will kick in starting in 2013. Half of the cuts—whether they amount to 1.2 trillion or a smaller amount—will come from defense and the other half from domestic programs. Several categories important to Democrats are exempted, including Social Security, Medicaid and payments to Medicare beneficiaries. Negotiations aimed at a complete deal now are largely being conducted by six supercommittee members, mostly senators, who met for several hours Thursday night and again Friday. It was the first time in several days such a large bipartisan group had met. One question facing both sides is whether a smaller deal is better than none at all. Sen. Kerry attacked the idea of settling for a smaller package. \\"We were sent here to do 1.2 trillion, or 1.5 trillion, or 4 trillion,\\" he said. \\"So the idea on Friday of settling for half of what the American people need and what we were sent here to do is unacceptable to me.\\" Republicans, stressing that they still want the biggest deal possible, have been more receptive to the notion of a smaller package, in part to stave off deep defense cuts. The White House has no plans for President Barack Obama to get involved in the supercommittee process after he returns to Washington Sunday from a trip to Hawaii, Australia and Indonesia. If the committee fails, Mr. Obama will declare the process a wasted opportunity and tell lawmakers they have a year to fix the problem, a senior administration official said. \\"We're not getting sucked into being legislator in chief,\\" the official said. \\"This is a job Congress gave itself. If there was a constructive role to play we would do it.\\" —Jonathan Cheng and Carol E. Lee contributed to this article.

Bennett - A supercommittee failure would trigger at least 500 billion in cuts to national security spending, but there is no consensus on just where they will be made. Lawmakers included the automatic cuts in the debt ceiling deal as an incentive to get Congress to agree to shave at least 1.2 trillion from the deficit. But the language also gave policy makers plenty of leeway. The cuts do not begin to take effect until January 2013, which gives Congress a full year to adapt them before they are implemented. There are also disagreements over language in the debt deal, which have led to different interpretations over what could be cut. All of this has led to predictions of huge lobbying fights on K Street and the halls of Congress, as well as dire warnings over the consequences of the cuts for both the nation’s security and economy. “I don’t even want to contemplate what will happen next year,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King (R-N.Y.) said in a telephone interview. “I’m really trying to head it off now,” King said. “It’s going to be lobbying, political, regional, ideological, philosophical — the whole range of divisions are going to be there.” House Armed Services Committee aides interpret the debt-ceiling deal’s mandatory cuts as putting only the Defense Department in the cross hairs. But House Foreign Affairs aides said the provision groups the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and all international affairs spending with the defense budget, meaning they could also face cuts. One former congressional aide said the flap reflects a longtime debate in Washington about just what falls under the national defense spending umbrella. Having multiple agencies’ budgets grouped together could lead to fights between advocates for the Pentagon and several other security agencies. Some defense hawks, like Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have talked publicly about merely voiding the defense cuts next year, before they would kick in. Graham told The Hill he’s looking at “a substitute for the triggers.” “We’re looking at different options to get to 1.2 trillion that would not destroy the Defense Department,” Graham said. HASC Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) told The Hill on Friday that members have informally discussed canceling the additional defense cuts. “But nothing serious,” he said before a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. President Obama warned last week that Congress should not “shirk” its responsibilities by negating the automatic cuts. While both parties are worried about the cuts, Republicans may be more wary. The debt deal also requires automatic cuts to domestic discretionary spending, but entitlements Democrats are trying to protect from deeper cuts in the supercommittee process are generally left alone. Cuts to Social Security and Medicaid would not be triggered, and cuts to Medicare would affect insurance companies, and not recipient benefits. This has appeared to give Democrats leverage in the supercommittee talks. Pentagon leaders and their congressional allies see the automatic national security cuts as a second major hit. DoD is already implementing a 10-year 350 billion cut from planned spending that came from the August debt deal. As defense hawks eye alternatives to sequestration, King is warning them to stay away from Department of Homeland Security spending. King told The Hill that he expects budget cutters will see Homeland Security as a target. “I’m sure they will” try to cut the department’s budget, King said. “I think it’s wrong, I think it’s shortsighted and it shows a lack of knowledge of how real threats are,” King said. “An attack against us at home, obviously is as serious, if not more so, than an attack overseas.” House Armed Services Committee spokesman Claude Chafin said the panel has yet to consider options for the day after a super panel failure. “We are focused solely on the supercommittee reaching a deal,” Chafin said. “That is the only guarantee for the DoD budget.” The debt panel must strike a deal by Nov. 23. If it does not, the automatic cuts would kick in in January 2013 — unless Congress moves to void them. Some observers see that as likely. “Only twice has a sequester taken place without Congress changing it and once it was so small it was less than two-thousandths of a percent of funding. Even if the supercommitee fails sequester isn’t likely to occur,” said Russell Rumbaugh, a former Senate Budget Committee aide now with the Stimson Center. “In this case, Congress has almost 14 months to change the law before the sequester takes place. That’s a lot of time to reconsider [what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has dubbed] ‘doomsday’ cuts.” ||||| If the congressional \\"super committee\\" fails in these final days, it will be up to American voters next year to decide how to tackle rising deficits: higher taxes or deep cuts in spending on Medicare The bipartisan panel plans to keep meeting over the weekend as it searches for a deal, but its 14-week effort to negotiate a long-term plan to reduce deficits by 1.5 trillion increasingly seems headed toward a fizzle.That would mark another setback in Congress' ability to take control of the country's deficit problem. But indications from Wall Street are that markets would not be seriously rattled by the lack of a deal, and absent that immediate danger, neither side has enough motivation to yield to the other's demands.Instead, the stalemate raises the stakes of next year's election. The choice voters will face over tax and spending issues is the same one that has stymied budget talks all year. Whichever party emerges on top after November's election will almost certainly assert a mandate for its preferred economic approach.\\"The election looks like it's going to be about taxes, spending, entitlements — the rich versus the middle class,\\" said Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst in Washington.If Republicans win the presidency and both houses of Congress, it could rekindle interest in a budget like the one that passed the House this year — the proposal from Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin to greatly reduce spending on Medicare by creating a system that gives seniors stipends for a fixed amount of insurance coverage. Republicans also would like lower tax rates — or at least an extension of the George W. Bush -era income tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012.On the other hand, if President Obama wins reelection and Democrats keep control of the Senate , Democrats probably would try to block major changes in Medicare, although they might agree to trims as they have in super committee talks. They may push for a tax increase on the wealthy by allowing the top-end Bush cuts to expire.Underlying these options is what could be described as an automatic, though partial, \\"grand bargain\\" to reduce deficits. If the committee fails to reach a deal, as expected, it would trigger 1.2 trillion in mandatory cuts that would slice across most federal agencies, starting in January 2013. At that time, if the Bush-era tax cuts for top-end earners have expired, another 800 billion would be pumped into government coffers, meaning long-term deficits would be reduced by at least 2 billion. The credit rating agencies are counting on at least part of this savings to fend off another downgrade of U.S. debt.Each party sees great political value in the campaign year ahead by pitching its plan — and pointing out what the other side would do. Republicans are already characterizing Obama and Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals, while the president and Democrats in Congress are painting their GOP opponents as beholden to the rich.\\"The president loves pointing fingers at scapegoats, but regardless of what the super committee does, Obama will be judged based on the state of the economy, and right now that's a troubling prospect for him,\\" said Kevin Madden, a GOP consultant and informal advisor to presidential candidate Mitt Romney However, a poll released Friday showed that if the super committee fails, the public will blame Republicans more than Democrats by a 10-point margin, making Democrats less inclined to cut a deal unless Republicans agree to increase revenue substantially.\\"If the plan is to extend the Bush tax cuts and to repeal the Medicare guarantee for our seniors, well, that's not balanced and that's a place we cannot go,\\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said this week, raising doubts about the prospects for a far-reaching deal. \\"I don't hear anything that sounds big and bold.\\"These final days before the committee's deadlines — Monday to post a proposal and Wednesday to approve it — are likely to be filled with assigning blame as both parties seek an endgame that gives them maximum political advantage.To be sure, Congress tends to work best when a deadline looms, and the super committee could still find compromise. Republicans made a 640-billion offer late Friday, with just 3 billion in new tax revenue that was scoffed at by Democrats.Congressional leaders appear to have decided that the risk of failing to achieve a deal is not as dangerous as the risk of agreeing to one that angers their respective bases and removes a defining issue of the next election.\\"The politicians care more about their parties and getting reelected than they do the very real problem,\\" said Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a past leader on deficit efforts, who called the super committee a \\"mistake\\" in an interview airing Sunday on C-SPAN 's \\"Newsmakers\\" program. \\"It was Washington's answer to kicking the can down the road.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"The Joint Congressional Committee remains at a deep impasse after Democrats rejected a new Republican proposal, devised with the help of Speaker John A.

PUBLISHED:. 05:50 EST, 19 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 06:02 EST, 19 October 2013. It's hardly your average drive in the country and just watching footage of Peter Taylor racing around Mull is enough to make you feel car sick. The young rally driver broke the all time record on a stage around the island during its annual road race. Taylor, 22, made it road an 8.3 mile stretch of the picturesque island off the west coast of Scotland in just six minutes and 42 seconds. Scroll down for video:. White knuckle ride: Rally driver Peter Taylor broke a stage record on the Isle of Mull with a 'stunning' piece of driving captured on camera. Fast: Taylor broke the record despite facing the challenge of a series of challenging bends and a new chicane added to the course. Stunning setting: The breathtaking white knuckle ride was filmed on the picturesque Isle of Mull (pictured) Despite being faced with the challenge of a series of hair raising bends and even a new chicane on the island's narrow single track road, Taylor and his co-driver flew around the course, winning richly deserved praise from rally fans. One fan who viewed the record breaking lap on YouTube described it as 'stunning'. Martin Curtis added: 'It's why these boys get my respect above circuit drivers.' But the rest of the Cumbrian driver's race wasn't quite as successful despite his brilliant white knuckle ride. Bad luck: The 22-year-old driver didn't perform quite as well in the rest of the race - he lost out on winning the rally overall. Losing time: Taylor suffered a series of unfortunate bumps during the rest of the race - one of which saw him lose his bumper. He missed out on winning the overall rally, after a series of unfortunate mistakes left his Ford Focus rather battered by the end of the race. He lost time because of a series of minor bumps one of which saw him lose the bumper of his car. The rally was eventually won by John MacCrone in his M-Sport prepared Ford Fiesta 82400. The Tunnock's Mull Rally was the first and remains one of only two rallies in the UK that is permitted to close roads in order for it to take place.

It was a long time is all I know. For my birthday, my parents took me and my brother out of school on the day before my birthday and we took a train. (Funny interjection, my mom was caught on the wrong side of the station so she ran across the rails and was pulled up by my dad a couple minutes before the train came.) It was a night train, so we had our own room where my brother and I claimed the top as our territory. (Look at my younger self’s squinty eyes… They are staring into your soul) Anyways, it was morning by the time we arrived at where I would spend my birthday. Vienna, Austria. I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good. The following days we went to Austrian Castle, Ice Cave, and more buildings and such. The trip overall made this birthday the most memorable and the best thus far. Bonus: We missed our night train back because of daylight saving hours. The trip back was definitely hectic, but adventurous.

Options: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 1 Stream of consciousness:","response":"Let's analyze the problem step by step to determine the number of cubes that will have 4 coloured sides and two non-coloured sides. 1. A cube has 6 faces. To have 4 coloured sides and 2 non-coloured sides, it means that we must have 4 faces with colours and 2 faces without colours. 2. The 2 non-coloured sides must be adjacent (touching) because if they were opposite, the cube would have 2 colours on opposite sides, which would result in only 3 coloured sides instead of 4. 3. Now, let's consider the placement options for the non-coloured sides: A. Two adjacent sides can be on the top and front. B. Two adjacent sides can be on the top and left side. C. Two adjacent sides can be on the top and right side. D. Two adjacent sides can be on the top and back. 4. In each of the placement options (A, B, C, and D), there must be a unique colour on the remaining 4 sides to ensure that they are coloured. From our analysis, we can see that there are a total of 4 placement options for the non-coloured sides, ensuring 4 coloured sides on each cube. Therefore, the correct answer is: (B) 4"},{"question":"In the beginning of year 1000 mount Etna had a huge volcanic eruption. To test the effect of volcanic eruption on sea level scientists measured geological data through carbon dating. They measured the data for four different time point - for year 998, year 1000, year 1002, and year 1010. Scientists now need to compare and analyze these data. According to Grinsted, would the sea level increase or decrease right after year 1000? Hint: As the thermal expansion is the key factor to the sea level variability, decreased heat content should result in a reduction in global mean sea levelon a decadal time scale.[2] However, Grinsted [2007] argued that a significant sea level rise is the first direct response to the volcanic eruption, and after that sea level becomes to drop. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9]","response":"According to Grinsted [2007], the sea level would initially increase right after the volcanic eruption at Mount Etna in the year 1000.

Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning.

Article: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, \\"In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.\\" A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Repo Men Context: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2025, a corporation called \\"The Union\\" has perfected bio-mechanical organs to replace diseased organs. However, if they fall behind on payments, a \\"repo man\\" reclaims the artificial organ (artiforg) from the body; the procedure frequently results in the death of the customer due to them being crucial organs. Remy and his partner Jake Freivald are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Jake does a quick repossession on a passenger in a cab using a kitchen knife. Carol sees this and leaves with Peter, urging Remy to make a decision. While out driving with Jake, they discover a \\"nest\\", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and become fugitives to avoid the repo men. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves and reclaim 32 artiforgs, which impresses their boss Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy refuses and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg. Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake. In sales, he is unable to lie to potential customers about the consequences of non-payment and is forced back into repo to pay for his heart, but has developed sympathy for his victims and develops a psychological block that prevents him from repossessing their artiforgs....

Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete. Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \\"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice. At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's then-drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \\"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did\\". The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994. A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used 'Satan' to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \\"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death\\". A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said \\"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop\\". After his death, a new generation of musicians tried to gain credibility by 'hyping-up' Euronymous, although he was also hailed as \\"the King\\" or \\"Godfather of Black Metal\\" by bands that had emerged before this new generation. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \\"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference\\". Lords of Chaos remarks: \\"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another\\". In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \\"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences\\". He added: \\"I think many people felt relief once he was gone\\". Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying \\"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone\\". What does \\"the latter\\" refer to?","response":"In the given passage, \\"the latter\\" refers to Vikernes' confession to the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. When mentioning the charges against Vikernes, the text states, \\"Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives.

First, it is essential to understand that personal experiences and interactions might not represent the broader reality. Human perception can be subject to localized experiences, and in this case, it is possible that you've mostly encountered people with a connection to Texas Instruments and had positive experiences with the company. However, this doesn't mean that most people around the world are with TI or that the company is universally loved. Furthermore, opinions about a company can be highly subjective and may vary significantly based on factors like personal experience, career goals, work-life balance, and company culture. To have a more accurate understanding of whether most people are with Texas Instruments and love the company, it's essential to gather information from a wider range of sources. You may want to consider the following: 1. Company size and scope: While Texas Instruments is a large and influential company, its workforce size (around 30,000 employees, as of 2020) is relatively small compared to the total global labor force. This fact alone would indicate that most people are not employees of TI. 2. Statistical data: Look into the company's ranking in terms of the number of employees, revenue, and market share to get a better understanding of its position in comparison to other companies. It’s important to recognize that there are many other large corporations that also command significant talent and workforce. 3. Employee reviews: Websites like Glassdoor and Indeed compile reviews from former and current employees that may give you a more comprehensive perspective on the overall perception of the company. Keep in mind that employees' opinions may greatly differ based on their respective roles, departments, and experiences within the company. 4. Surveys and studies: There may be existing surveys or studies that attempt to quantify public opinion on specific companies, such as \\"Best Places to Work\\" and \\"Most Admired Companies\\" lists published by reputable magazines and websites. These rankings may provide some indication of how well-regarded a company is among employees and the industry as a whole. 5. It’s crucial to remember that employees from different companies have varied experiences, and one individual's perception of a company might be very different from another's. In summary, while it is possible that the people you have talked to have positive experiences with Texas Instruments, it is not valid to extrapolate this anecdotal evidence to suggest that most people are with the company or that the company is universally loved. Instead, a broader analysis based on various sources of information, combined with any personal experiences, can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the company and its effect on employees and public opinion."},{"question":"OK. You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Pick which sentence is not logical. Options: - Sentence A: \\"Joan soaked the tea in water.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Joan soaked the tea in oil.\\"","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's evaluate both sentences A and B for their coherence. - Sentence A: \\"Joan soaked the tea in water.\\" Tea is commonly made by soaking tea leaves, tea bags, or herbal infusions in hot water. The heat allows the flavors and beneficial compounds to seep out of the tea material and into the water, creating the beverage known as tea. Given that this is a typical way to prepare tea and it aligns with the common practice, this sentence is logical. - Sentence B: \\"Joan soaked the tea in oil.\\" Soaking tea in oil is not a commonly known method of preparing tea or extracting its flavors and compounds. Tea is generally water-soluble and is not designed to mix well with oil. Moreover, oils do not offer the same heat conduction as water, preventing effective extraction of flavors and aromas. As this method of preparing tea is atypical and inconsistent with normal tea preparation methods, this sentence is not logical. Therefore, out of the two given options, Sentence B: \\"Joan soaked the tea in oil\\" is not logical."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Extremal states are usually called extremal states . Note that a condition is a pure state if and only if it is convex in the pure state group . Sentence 2: Extremal states are usually called pure states . Note that a state is a pure state if and only if it is extremal in the convex set of states . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","response":"Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1. In Sentence 1, extremal states are referred to as \\"extremal states\\" and the concept of a \\"condition\\" being a \\"pure state\\" is introduced. If a condition is a pure state, it must be convex in the pure state group. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2. In Sentence 2, extremal states are referred to as \\"pure states\\" and the concept of a \\"state\\" being a \\"pure state\\" is introduced. If a state is a pure state, it must be extremal in the convex set of states. Step 3: Assess whether both sentences convey the same information. Both sentences discuss the relationship between extremal states and pure states. The main differences between the sentences are the choice of words. Sentence 1 uses \\"condition\\" and \\"extremal states\\" as synonyms for \\"pure state,\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"state\\" and \\"extremal state\\" as synonyms. Despite this difference, the underlying concepts and relationships appear consistent across both sentences. Conclusion: The two sentences convey the same information, albeit with slight differences in terminology. Both sentences discuss the relationship between extremal/pure states and states/conditions. Thus, although they use slightly different wording, they present a consistent understanding of the relationships between these concepts."},{"question":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

Step 1: Establish a connection between the concepts - A bunch refers to a group or collection of something, fill means to occupy a space, and a shelf is a flat surface for storage. - A possible connection can be that a bunch can be stored on a shelf, and the shelf can be filled. Step 2: Create a subject for the sentence - I'll consider that the bunch is made up of objects, such as books or fruits, so that it's something tangible and can be related to in terms of filling a shelf. Step 3: Form a verb or action that relates to the concepts - Since fill and shelf are the more action-oriented concepts, I'll use a verb that signifies the action of putting something onto a shelf and filling it. Step 4: Arrange the concepts in the sentence - Start with the subject (bunch), followed by the action (fill), and finally the end position (shelf). With these steps in mind, the sentence could be: \\"A bunch of books filled the empty shelf, creating an organized and visually appealing display.\\""},{"question":"Please add punctuation to this: In the case that your ICM file doesnt open it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your PC to view or edit ICM file extensions Punctuation version:","response":"In the case that your ICM file doesn't open, it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your PC to view or edit ICM file extensions."},{"question":"Our foursome was looking forward to trying this place based on the reviews.

The disappointment of the customers upon finding out that the establishment only serves brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, which does not meet their expectations as they were looking for a late lunch or early dinner at 4:00 PM. 2. The dissatisfaction with the menu offerings during that time, specifically not wanting to have pancakes at 4:00 PM, suggesting that the brunch options do not suit their preferences. 3.

When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake.

Executives at some of Apple's suppliers said the company has been testing designs for a large-screen high-definition set. Two people said Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which assembles the iPhone and iPad, has been collaborating with Japan's Sharp Corp. on the design of the new television for several months. \\"It isn't a formal project yet. It is still in the early stage of ... ||||| S There are all kinds of Apple rumors out there; big ones, small ones, smart ones, dumb ones. God knows we run enough of them ourselves. But there's a genus of the species that we never post, ever, because it's so obviously and insidiously dumb and wrong and bad. And here is, without exaggeration, the very absolute worst example of it I've ever seen. Ladies and gentlemen, meet your worst Apple rumor of the year, and maybe of all time. You may have seen the headlines already, here and here and probably most other tech sites you follow. The basic gist: APPLE'S HDTV TO HAVE 3D TECH THAT WILL CHANGE TELEVISION FOREVER There is, as you might have noticed the last time you attained even the vaguest state of consciousness, no such thing as an Apple HDTV. There never has been. That headline is like saying Charles Barkley might put up a triple double in the Space Jam rematch. So how did a product that doesn't—and may well never—exist suddenly get features that, if it's even possible, exist even less? Because this morning, the two worst rumor sources in tech found each other. Analysts met patents, and created a perfect storm of bullshit. This morning, before the market opened, two Morgan Stanley analysts released a report about \\"iTV,\\" Apple's bold foray into our living rooms. The mythical television set would be worth 13 billion to Apple in the US alone, 39 billion globally, and 68,000 gumdrops in Candyland. That's harmless enough; market projections are at least based on how many TVs people buy currently, and a reasonable guess at how many of those people might buy the Apple version. Sure, why not? But then the trouble starts. It turns out that not only do Morgan Stanley's analysts have a pretty good idea of how many non-existent iTVs Apple will sell, they're also privy to a swath of non-existent features that'll come with it. Including, as StreetInsider happily passes along, a 3D remote control, a \\"groundbreaking 3D imaging and display system\\" that knows where you are and what you're doing and, presumably, shows Duck Dynasty from the appropriate angle, and the ability to display an athlete's blood pressure during football games because why not, might as well, it's all just make-believe anyway. Tickle Honey Boo Boo from your couch while you're at it. It's tempting to think that these analysts know something you don't. That they have covert sources slipping juicy leaks into their Honeybaked Ham deliveries. But you know what? They don't. They're guessing, same as anyone else. We don't cover analyst rumors, ever, because analysts don't know anything. To put it another way: if they did, Apple's HDTV would be here already. Years ago. But what makes this particular rumor so galling is that it's not just the normal analyst projections and assumptions and bloviation. It's not even that it's yet another rumor—after nearly THREE YEARS of unfulfilled rumormongering—about a product that is Not Even a Thing. It's that all of these features that the Morgan Stanley braintrust cites come from patents. Come on, guys. You know better than this. The problem with taking patents at face value is that patents aren't products and, more importantly, are often never even intended to be. Companies file patents defensively, stockpiling them like warheads for the never-ending infringement wars. They are, in their own way, every bit as Not Even a Thing as iTV itself. That's what every single one of these \\"features\\" is based on. It gets worse, it gets worse! These aren't even new patents Morgan Stanley dug up from some Cupertino patent bunker. The most recent one was filed in 2008, and most were granted months or years ago. Or not at all, which, even better. Will Apple act on them someday? Maybe. Right after they get to that wearable display, and finish building all those iTunes kiosks. Look, it's just a harmless rumor, sure. But it's also a lazy rumor, one that every single person involved knows has zero percent chance of becoming true in any reasonable amount of time. Could Apple announce an iTV tomorrow? Sure. Could it somehow put Duck Dynasty on your couch? Of course. But it won't. And no one knows that better than the people telling you it might. ||||| So, how could Apple (AAPL) “revolutionize” the television? How about by providing full three-dimensional projections in your living room? StreetInsider reports that Morgan Stanley analysts Katy Huberty and Jerry Liu have outlined some possibilities for what features an Apple HDTV could deliver based on patents the company has filed over the last several years. The most interesting feature the analysts outlined was a “groundbreaking 3D imaging and display system that optically detects human positions and motions, projects virtual objects onto a display area, and provides audio and visual feedback.” Other possible features include Siri integration, a 3D remote control application that displays a cursor “by the position and orientation at which it is held,” and a “search engine interface to search content across various libraries such as iTunes, imdb.com, amazon.com, netflix.com, and social networking sites, as well as advertising content.” We obviously have no idea if any of these radical concepts will actually make it onto an Apple TV but it does give us an idea of just how big Apple is thinking when it talks about ushering in a new era of television. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Apple is reportedly exploring designs for television sets in collaboration with its suppliers in Asia.

The Ganges River is not only significant due to its size but also holds immense religious, cultural, and historical importance for the people of India. The river originates from the Gangotri Glacier in the state of Uttarakhand in the Indian Himalayas and travels a distance of about 2,525 kilometers (1,569 miles) before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges River is the third-largest river in the world by discharge, with an average annual flow of around 38,129 cubic meters per second (1,348,000 cubic feet per second). Spanning across a drainage basin of approximately 1,086,000 square kilometers (420,000 square miles), it supports a large and diverse population of humans, flora, and fauna. Millions of people live close to the bank of the Ganges and rely on the river and its tributaries for their daily needs such as drinking water, agriculture, and sanitation. In addition to its geographical wonders, the Ganges River holds religious significance in Hinduism. It is believed to have descended from heaven to earth, symbolizing life-giving energy and purification. The river is considered a sacred entity, often personified as the goddess Ganga in Hindu mythology. Each year, millions of Hindus perform rituals near the river or even immerse themselves in its waters to cleanse themselves of sins and attain spiritual liberation. The Ganges River is also home to some notable pilgrimage sites and holy cities recognized in Hinduism. Haridwar and Rishikesh in the state of Uttarakhand, Varanasi in the state of Uttar Pradesh, and Prayagraj (formerly known as Allahabad) are some of the significant religious destinations along the Ganges. Devotees, tourists, and spiritual seekers from around the world visit these holy sites to experience the rich history, religious beliefs, and cultural practices associated with the river. Despite its religious significance, the Ganges River faces numerous environmental challenges such as pollution, dumping of untreated sewage and industrial waste, deforestation, and sand mining. These factors have led to a deterioration in the water quality, posing a threat to the millions who rely on the Ganges for survival. In response, the Indian government has initiated various clean-up and rehabilitation programs, such as the Namami Gange Programme and the Ganga Action Plan, to revive the health of the river. Through these initiatives, the government aims to address the ecological and social issues connected to the Ganges River. In conclusion, the Ganges River is the largest river in India, serving an essential role as a source of livelihood and religious significance for millions of people.

Options: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","response":"(2). It is not possible to tell. The color of the moped is not relevant to determining truth of the premise \\"A woman prepares to start her moped.\\" The statement \\"A woman prepares to start her moped\\" refers to an action taking place -- that of the woman preparing to start the moped. It does not specify or bear a direct relation to the color of the moped. On the other hand, the statement \\"The moped is pink\\" is a separate assertion providing additional information about the moped. It does not verify or refute the action described in the original statement. This statement is about a characteristic of the moped, its color, which is not inherent in the information provided in the initial statement about the woman preparing to start the moped. Therefore, if we have no other information or context beyond these two sentences, we cannot definitively say whether the premise \\"A woman prepares to start her moped\\" is true or not based solely on the knowledge that \\"The moped is pink.\\" In essence, the specific color of the moped doesn't stop, allow, verify or refute the action of the woman preparing to start the moped. Both of these statements may concurrently be true (that is, a woman is preparing to start a moped, and the moped is pink), but knowledge of the first doesn't inherently provide knowledge of the latter, and vice versa. So, it's not possible to state whether the premise \\"A woman prepares to start her moped\\" is true or not based solely on the information that \\"The moped is pink.\\""},{"question":"Q:Information: - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period).

It’s no longer just a fight for milk farmers, who’ve grown increasingly angry about plant-based food companies (think soy, almond, and cashews) calling their liquid products “milk.” For the first time, vegetables are being roped into the debate—all because of the arrival and popularization of “cauliflower rice.” “Only rice is rice, and calling ‘riced vegetables’ ‘rice,’ is misleading and confusing to consumers,” Betsy Ward, president of industry lobby USA Rice, said in a statement earlier this month. “We may be asking the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to look at this.” Ward added that Scott Gottlieb, the new Trump-appointed FDA commissioner, could use his power to enforce the agency’s existing definitions for food, the so-called “standards of identity.” Reuters/Khaled Abdullah Cauliflower by the truckload. Only recently did cauliflower rice appear in the freezer section of the grocery store—and in close proximity to frozen rice and vegetable packages, Michael Klein, a spokesman for the rice lobby, told Quartz. Klein adds that one company, Green Giant Fresh, used a “Move over, rice” marketing campaign. But the cauliflower side isn’t worried. “Using the FDA to combat merchandising efforts? That’s a story they’re telling their retail partners,” said Gina Nucci of the California-based produce company, Mann Packing, which sells cauliflower products. “Every section of the grocery store is fighting for the same food dollar. Same share of stomach. Consumers are smart. I don’t think anyone is going to mistake regular rice for a riced cauliflower product, frozen or fresh.” She says consumers are on the lookout for rice alternatives because there’s a demand for ready-to-eat products that take less time to prepare than whole-head cauliflower rice. Still, this isn’t a clean case for the rice lobby, which now finds itself in the unenviable position of appearing to speak out of both sides of its mouth. While the industry group frets over shredded cauliflower, some of its members benefit from relaxed enforcement of standards of identity. Rice milk and yogurt can be found at nearly all major supermarket retailers, including Costco and Whole Foods 365 brand. Yet greater enforcement of the FDA’s standards of identity would likely give those rice products companies trouble. For its part, the rice lobby says the goal should be to avoid confusing consumers—but it does not want to be the arbiter of deciding whether consumers are confused when they see rice milk on the shelves of the dairy section. (The dairy industry has been vocal about this matter: “Milk is a product that comes from cows,” it contended (pdf) in February.) “Just as with milk, no one owns the word ‘rice,'” said Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association. To date, in at least two US lawsuits (one against Whitewave Foods Company in 2013 and the other against Trader Joe’s Company in 2015) judges have dismissed cases in which plaintiffs sought to have companies stop using the word “milk” when marketing soy milk. “As long as consumers are not confused,” Simon added, “I doubt USA Rice will get very far with FDA.” The Good Food Institute earlier this year submitted to the government a request that it clarify how foods can be named. “This is what’s so frustrating about this issue,” Joanna Grossman, a lobbyist for the group, told Quartz. ”Everybody wants to pick and choose what should come under greater enforcement and, in my mind, there’s a broader problem. So many of these definitions haven’t caught up with the times. We’re operating in a sphere where some of these definitions are really strange and obscure.” Take, for instance, tamales. Technically speaking, under the current USDA standards of identity, frozen vegetarian tamales in the supermarket freezer section aren’t tamales. That’s because, under agency rules, 25% of a tamale must be comprised of meat. ||||| Cauliflower rice has been popping up in grocery freezer aisles and on the menu at restaurants nationwide, as an increasing number of health-conscious eaters look to curb their carb intake. The plant-based imitation food seems to be especially prevalent in Silicon Valley, where tech workers are cutting carbs and eating lots of fat in an attempt to lead longer, better lives. The rising popularity of the carb-light alternative to rice isn't making the rice industry happy. A rice lobby group said it may ask the US government to review its definition of rice in an effort to lessen the competition in cauliflower, Quartz reported. Cauliflower rice looks like rice. It's made from pulsing the vegetable briefly in a food processor. Like rice, it soaks up the juices and seasonings of whatever it's cooked with. But on its own, cauliflower rice has the bland taste of cauliflower and the wetness of minced zucchini. On a recent visit to Mealmade, an on-demand food delivery startup based in San Francisco, I watched one cook chop cauliflower while another pulverized the vegetable in a food processor. Later in the day, they would scoop it into compostable containers for a variety of dishes. The startup, founded in 2015, specializes in healthy takes on comfort food classics. The Carne Asada Taco Bowl tops cauliflower rice with grass-fed sirloin steak, fried plantains, organic pickled peppers, and guacamole. The Orange Chicken — a best-seller according to Mealmade — buries the cauliflower rice in coconut-flour fried chicken, cilantro, and sliced kumquats. Cauliflower rice is also on the menus at on-demand food delivery startups Sprig and Thistle, as well as meal-kit delivery services Blue Apron and Sun Basket. There are about two grams of net carbohydrates in a cup of cauliflower, compared to 51 grams in white rice and 42 grams in brown rice. The rice industry is not thrilled at the prospect of an imitation food, especially a guilt-free one, taking away their market share. \\"Only rice is rice, and calling 'riced vegetables' (as cauliflower rice is sometimes named) 'rice,' is misleading and confusing to consumers,\\" Betsy Ward, president of USA Rice, said in a statement in May. \\"We may be asking the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to look at this.\\" The FDA has oversight over food labeling and can force a company to change a product name if it is likely to stump customers. For example, Tyson's Any'tizers Boneless Chicken Wyngz* feature an asterisk because the \\"wyngz\\" contain no real wing meat. Silicon Valley startup Hampton Creek created a line of \\"Just Mayo\\" products made from plants. The FDA issued a letter in 2015 saying the products can't be called mayonnaise because they do not contain eggs. (The FDA later decided only semantic changes on the label were necessary.) Dairy groups have waged similar battles with makers of soy and almond milk. Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, remains optimistic. \\"Just as with milk, no one owns the word 'rice,'\\" Simon told Quartz. ||||| Summary:","response":"The rising popularity of cauliflower rice as a healthy, carb-light alternative to traditional rice has sparked controversy among food suppliers in the US, with industry lobby group USA Rice arguing that its labelling is misleading and confusing to customers.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - PTS-DOS is a disk operating system, a DOS clone, developed in Russia by PhysTechSoft. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS.

You want great pictures from a camera, right? You'll get them with this one. But there's something else a really good ... camera should deliver. A good, solid feel in your hand. It's almost TOO light. The entire camera is PLASTIC and has the feeling of a disposable. This would be a 5 star PLUS camera if the body were titanium and it had a bit more heft. I wouldn't reccomend this camera to a friend. I KNOW there are more solid cameras out there. Look for them and don't but this one. Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"The tone of this product review is mixed, leaning towards negative. Explanation: The reviewer begins by acknowledging the positive aspect of the product, stating that it delivers great pictures. This introduction sets a moderately positive tone. However, as the review progresses, it becomes increasingly more negative. The next section of the review mentions that a really good camera should have a good, solid feel in the hand, and they criticize the camera's lightness and plastic construction. The reviewer believes the camera feels disposable and compares it unfavorably to higher-quality materials such as titanium. This transition from positive to negative tone adds emphasis to their dissatisfaction with the body of the camera. The reviewer then states that the camera would be a 5-star product if it had a more solid build and weighed more. This implies that they find the camera's performance and picture-taking abilities to be excellent, but the poor build quality undermines its overall value. The negative tone further solidifies when the reviewer explicitly states they wouldn't recommend the camera to a friend and suggests looking for more solid cameras available in the market. Thus, it becomes clear that the negative aspects of the product outweigh the positive ones in the reviewer's opinion. In conclusion, while the review acknowledges the camera's ability to take great pictures, the overwhelmingly negative focus on the build quality and overall dissatisfaction with the product suggests that the tone of the review is mixed, leaning towards negative."},{"question":"Tweet: @vgc_scott I sent you an email! Please read it Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","response":"Alright, little buddy! So, when we talk about the \\"sentiment\\" of a tweet, it means how someone feels or what kind of emotions they're showing. In this tweet, the person is just telling their friend that they sent an email. They're also asking their friend to please read it. It doesn't really show happiness or sadness, so the sentiment here is neutral. That means it's not showing any strong emotion."},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: Han Chinese make up the vast majority of the population, and the largest Han subgroup are the speakers of Wu varieties of Chinese. There are also 400,000 members of ethnic minorities, including approximately 200,000 She people and approximately 20,000 Hui Chinese[citation needed]. Jingning She Autonomous County in Lishui is the only She autonomous county in China. What is the answer to this question: What varieties of Chinese do the largest Han subgroup speak?","response":"The largest Han subgroup, which consists of the majority of the population, primarily speaks the Wu varieties of Chinese. The Wu language group is a subdivision of the wider Sino-Tibetan language family and belongs to the Han Chinese languages category. This linguistic classification has its origins in the ancient region of Wu, which now corresponds to present-day areas including Shanghai, southern Jiangsu Province, eastern Zhejiang Province, and the southern part of Anhui Province. The Wu varieties of Chinese are spoken by millions of people, and these dialects exhibit significant diversity in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Some of the most well-known Wu dialects include Shanghainese, Suzhounese, Wenzhounese, and Ningboese. These dialects are not entirely mutually intelligible with Mandarin, which is the official language of the People's Republic of China, giving the Wu dialects a distinct linguistic identity. As a result, the largest Han subgroup, which mainly speaks the Wu dialects, plays a significant role in shaping the linguistic landscape of China. In addition to the Wu languages, this diverse population of Han Chinese also contributes to the rich tapestry of other regional languages, such as Hakka, Yue (Cantonese), and Min, that are spoken across the country. Moreover, the article mentions that there are around 400,000 members of ethnic minorities within the region, which includes roughly 200,000 She people and about 20,000 Hui Chinese. The Jingning She Autonomous County in Lishui represents the only She autonomous county in the entirety of China. Together with the Han Chinese, these other ethnic and linguistic groups create a vibrant and complex cultural and linguistic environment in China that speaks to the broader themes of unity and diversity found throughout the nation's history."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who supplemented his salary by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\"? from the following article ? In 1898 the RCM offered Holst a further year's scholarship, but he felt that he had learned as much as he could there and that it was time, as he put it, to \\"learn by doing\\". Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year The Times had praised his song \\"Light Leaves Whisper\\", \\"a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling\\".Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that \\"man cannot live by composition alone\\"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for \\"the Worm\\" or any other light orchestra \\"a wicked and loathsome waste of time\\". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was \\"trashy\\" but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: \\"To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience.\\"With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register...

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei. Sarawak's coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban — Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers. (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities. ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony. Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore. In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803–1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei. He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit. In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier). He tried to halt the Dayaks' piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \\"morally acceptable\\" customs. His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted. His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border. Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula. In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles. More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life. He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace. Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was \\"rented\\" from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent. Dent was operating a royal charter for the British North Borneo Company — a charter similar to that of the EIC. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Which groups fought for control of Borneo in the 19th Century?\\" is \\"Muslims, Balanini pirates, Iban (Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers)\\"?","response":"Yes, sweetie, that's right! In the 19th century, in a place called Borneo, there were some groups fighting for control.

Her parents decided to give her 15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: 5?","response":"Step 1: Determine the amount of money Betty has saved so far. Since Betty has saved half of the money she needs for the wallet, and the wallet costs 100, we can calculate how much Betty has saved by dividing the wallet cost by 2: 100 / 2 = 50 So, Betty has saved 50 so far. Step 2: Calculate the amount of money given by her parents. Betty's parents gave her 15. So, this amount is added to her savings. Step 3: Calculate the amount of money given by her grandparents. Betty's grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which means: 15 (from parents) × 2 = 30 Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Betty has after receiving the gifts from her parents and grandparents. To find this, we add the amount saved, the amount from her parents, and the amount from her grandparents: 50 (saved) + 15 (parents) + 30 (grandparents) = 95 Step 5: Calculate how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet. Now we can subtract the total amount Betty has from the cost of the wallet: 100 (wallet cost) - 95 (total amount) = 5 So, Betty needs 5 more to buy the wallet."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Ear Gasm!

Ditto the condominium and cooperative apartment. Swapping houses for vacation purposes is hardly a new phenomenon. Those who operate as intermediaries in such exchanges say that they are constantly growing. This is the time of year when arrangements for the summer months are normally set in motion. Accordingly, Americans across the country who are familiar with the process are deep into an examination of the possibilities. The choices are broad, ranging from city apartments to castles in Spain, cottages in Ireland, and seaside villas in the Canary Islands or the Bahamas. Judy and Francis Furton, retired schoolteac hers from Detroit who now live in Guadalajara, Mexico, are a couple with long experience inhouse swaps. They have been exchanging with h omeowners in the United States and overseas for 20 years, they said b y telephone from Guadalajara, and this year they plan to swap again. They have b een to Britain, Greece, Jamaica, Bermuda, Venezuela and Hawaii and mo re. Their one-story three-bedroom house in Guadalajara comes with ma id and car - ''Mexican charm with American comfort,'' asthe Furtons p ut it in the home exchange directory. ''Your home is safer with people in it,'' says Mr. Furton, ''and think of all the money you are saving.'' The Furtons list their house in a catalogue prepared jointly by the Vacation Exchange Club, whose offices are at 350 Broadway in Manhattan; the Holiday Home Exchange of Milsons Point, Australia, and the Hawaii Home Interchange in Honolulu. These organizations in turn are affiliated with about 20 other exchange organizations in Europe, including Intervac International and The Directory Group. Over the years a number of similar organizations have been formed in this country and disbanded. The Vacation Exchange Club, founded in 1960, charges an annual membership fee of 21. Members get catalogues in February and April listing the properties available for swaps. A member joining this month, for example, would get both catalogues, but his own home would be listed, assuming a listing were wanted, only in the April catalogue. House exchanges are also arranged through listings posted on bulletin boards at schools and churches, and through classified advertisements in newspapers or magazines distributed in the area people want to visit. The enthusiasts see many advantages. Other people's houses can serve as a comfortable base, they say, from which to explore new areas or to visit friends and relatives without burdening them. The traveler saves hotel bills and the expense of constantly eating out. The uninitiated, however, remain uncertain about letting strangers into their homes. They worry about damage to furnishings and whether the house and car will be adequately covered by insurance. They also wonder whether they would find the house as clean when they return as it was when they left it. ''Relax and have a good time,'' was the advice from the Furtons, who said that with proper preparation, the rest will take care of itself. The Vacation Exchange Club catalogue contains about 6,000 listings, about a third of them in the United States. One recent catalogue, for example, included a large home on 10 acres with garden, pool and tennis courts in the Lower Blue Montains of West Sydney, Australia, owned by a medical specialist; an apartment in Hong Kong with a view of Hong Kong Harbor and the Lowloon Mountains of China, owned by a Union Carbide executive; a remote field cottage in County Cork, Ireland, owned by a duke, and a summer cottage on the ocean in Newport, R.I. David Ostroff, founder and president of the club, emphasizes that the home exchange service is not a real estate, rental or travel agency. ''We only publish and distribute this directory,'' he said. ''We cannot be responsible for the homes, the actions of subscribers or the accuracy of the listings,'' he said. ''On the other hand, since 1960 we have received only a handful of complaints from the thousands who have exchanged.'' He said it would be ''dishonest of us to pretend that exchangers face no risks.'' But the actual dangers are not those that beginners usually expect, he said. There are few instances of property damage or theft, he said. The most frequent complaints arise from differences in housekeeping standards. Less frequent but more serious are reports that some exchangers disappoint their correspondents by withdrawing from apparently firm commitments. A trusting, friendly relationship can be built long before the exchange begins, he said. This is done through letters, tape recordings or telephone calls, which are helpful in personalizing the relationship. Mr. Ostroff also advises people to find out whether their vehicle insurance is adequate, and whether any permits are required, when people are also exchanging the use of cars, boats or other recreational vehicles. Exchangers should be covered, as would any other guest in the house or any friend who uses the family car or other property. He is full of additional tips to the novice: Find out what is covered by insurance in the home being visited; if not meeting the guests beforehand, arrange for keys to be collected from and returned to a third party; lock away valuable or fragile ornaments; leave plenty of closet and drawer space for guests. And don't forget to ask friends and neighbors to welcome the guests, guide them and make them feel at home. As Mr. Ostroff sees it, the house itself is the least important part of it. It's a cross-cultural experience, he says, ''different from what you would have if you stayed at the Dusseldorf Hilton.'' One point of ten made by exchangers is that people living in locations fav ored by travelers have an easier time finding an exchange part ner. Thus, people living in and near the New York area are often in a good position to make swaps. After 50 exchange experiences, Judy and Francis Furton are also mines of information on what the well-prepared swapper should know. They advise, first of all, flexibility. As to time, ''be as flexible as your employment and holiday schedule permit.'' As to place, ''decide on dozens of places, not just one.'' They say the swapper should make the house easy for the stranger to live in. Start by preparing a loose-leaf notebook with instructions on using appliances and other equipment. Leave city and area maps. Tell the visitor how to find stores, repair shops, services of all kinds. Recommend restaurants. Leave telephone numbers for services of all types - insurance agent, doctor, dentist, helpful neighbors and baby-sitters. The Furtons said they usually paid the utility bills when exchangers were using their house - except for long-distance telephone calls. They also said that repair bills were usually paid by the owner, but an unexpected major repair is cleared with a telephone call or cable before work is begun. Exchangers agree in advance who will pay for yard care, maid service or cleaning help. The Furtons say their experience with the cleanliness issue is that standards vary. ''The exchange home may not be as clean as you keep your own,'' Mrs. Furton says. ''Even worse, you may have exchanged with a very fussy housekeeper who thinks your home isn't clean.'' If there are complaints, she says, write a letter to the exchange partner expressing the grievance in detail. Then burn it. ''You'll feel much better,'' she said.

Why do some snipers prefer bolt-action rifles? Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPT: *no. *yes.","response":"The questions are not the same. The best sniper rifle in WW2: During World War II, there were several sniper rifles used by various countries, but one of the most effective ones was the Soviet Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU sniper rifle. It earned the reputation of being one of the best sniper rifles at that time due to several reasons: 1. Accuracy: The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU was known for its remarkable accuracy, which was essential for a sniper rifle. It used the 7.62x54mmR cartridge, a highly potent and accurate round. 2. Range: The effective range of the Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU was between 800 and 1,000 meters, allowing Soviet snipers to engage targets at considerable distances. When equipped with a PU scope, it offered a 3.5x magnification, making it easier for snipers to focus on their targets. 3. Reliability: The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU sniper rifle was known for its robust design, making it capable of withstanding the harsh conditions encountered on the Eastern Front, including freezing temperatures and mud. 4. Production: The Mosin-Nagant had been in production since the late 19th century, making it widely available during WW2. The Soviets could readily produce and supply these sniper rifles to their troops in substantial numbers. 5. Skilled operators: Soviet snipers, such as Vasily Zaytsev and Lyudmila Pavlichenko, were highly trained and proved the effectiveness of the Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU in combat, with many of them achieving over 200 confirmed kills. Why some snipers prefer bolt-action rifles: Bolt-action rifles remain popular choices among snipers and marksmen due to several reasons: 1. Accuracy: Bolt-action rifles are known for their excellent accuracy because of the rigid and sturdy design of their lock-up mechanism. This ensures that there is minimal movement of the components during the firing process, ultimately leading to consistent and precise shots. 2. Reliability: Bolt-action rifles have few moving parts, which reduces the chance of mechanical failure. This simplicity also makes them more resistant to dirt, grime, and harsh environmental conditions, ensuring that they remain functional when needed. 3. Recoil management: Bolt-action rifles allow the shooter to have more control over the recoil, as they manually cycle the bolt, enabling better follow-up shots. This is particularly helpful for snipers who need to make rapid, consecutive shots while maintaining accuracy. 4. Noise reduction: Bolt-action rifles often produce less noise than semi-automatic rifles due to the absence of a cycling action during firing. This aspect is critical for maintaining stealth in sniper operations. 5. Ammunition versatility: Bolt-action rifles can be adapted to use various calibers without compromising the weapon's reliability. This makes them suitable for different types of engagements and enables the sniper to choose the appropriate ammo for their particular situation. While both questions pertain to sniper rifles, they address different aspects: the first question seeks to identify the best sniper rifle used during WW2, and the second question asks why snipers might prefer bolt-action rifles in general."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Having read Jim Dobson’s latest lecture, I feel a little bit like SpongeBob SquarePants: maligned and misunderstood. But it would be unfair, I think, to suggest that SpongeBob has become bitter over his experience with Jim Dobson; he seems to have moved on. Frankly, though, I don’t understand why Jim Dobson always feels the need to justify himself in such great detail. If he believes that Dick Armey is the only person who thinks he is a bully, it should be of little concern to him. On some issues, regarding interactions between us, his recollections are clearly different than mine. It seems, therefore, that Jim Dobson is no more willing to believe himself a bully than I am able to believe he is a gentle soul. For well over a decade, Dobson and several other self-anointed leaders of America’s Christian evangelicals have cajoled and threatened Republican leaders with public and private ultimatums. As early as 1995, we were being told what bitter disappointments we had turned out to be by Jim Dobson. Time magazine reports that as early as \\"March, James Dobson, head of the powerful Focus on the Family organization, fired off open letters to GOP chairman Haley Barbour, complaining bitterly about the lack of immediate payoff from the November election. Fearful of compromising with 'anti-family' elements, Dobson argued that it was time to fold the all-inviting 'big tent' of the Republican Party.\\" In 1998, he was quoted in the Washington Times in what became a typical, scolding refrain: \\"Does the Republican Party want our votes, no strings attached — to court us every two years, and then to say, 'Don't call me; I'll call you' — and to not care about the moral law of the universe? ... Is that what they want? Is that the way the system works? Is this the way it's going to be? If it is, I'm gone, and if I go, I will do everything I can to take as many people with me as possible.\\" In 2004, Dobson told ABC News that he was “quite sure [President Bush] will fail us. He doesn’t dance to our tune. … I think that this President has two years — or more broadly, the Republican party has two years to implement those policies or certainly four, or I believe they’ll pay a price at the — in the next election.” In 2005, Dobson and his colleagues even sent a threatening letter to the White House challenging their decision to focus on Social Security reform after the 2004 elections. That letter read in part: \\"We couldn't help but notice the contrast between how the president is approaching the difficult issue of Social Security privatization where the public is deeply divided and the marriage issue where public opinion is overwhelmingly on his side. ... Is [President Bush] prepared to spend significant political capital on privatization but reluctant to devote the same energy to preserving traditional marriage? If so it would create outrage with countless voters who stood with him just a few weeks ago, including an unprecedented number of African-Americans, Latinos and Catholics who broke with tradition and supported the president. ... When the administration adopts a defeatist attitude on an issue that is at the top of our agenda, it becomes impossible for us to unite our movement on an issue such as Social Security privatization where there are already deep misgivings.\\" So try to understand and forgive my indiscrete use of words over a year ago in an interview, when I used the terms “thugs” and “bully.” My friend Rep. Mike Pence called me out on that, and he was right. And, as much as I never enjoyed Jim Dobson’s many lectures over the years, I too, like SpongeBob, have moved on to the serious issues faced by the conservative movement in America today. One of Armey’s Axioms says that if it’s about you, you lose. The idea is always bigger than the man. If this debate becomes merely a Jim Dobson versus Dick Armey circus, it doesn’t help the American public in any way. There is a fundamental debate going on here, one in which neither of us matters all that much. The very real tragedy of the past 60 years is the ongoing expansion and intrusion of the federal government into the traditionally private sphere of American life. Activist judges are clearly responsible for much of the damage, but just as corrosive is the expansion of the federal bureaucracy into education, welfare, and health care and retirement. The result is that private, social decisions once left to individuals and communities are now under the control of Washington powerbrokers. Our cultural debate has become politicized. In fact, the specific demands constantly made by Dobson and his gang in the name of “values voters” feel a lot like the group identity politics employed by the left wing that every conservative should abhor. The politicization of the culture war cheapens the political participation of millions of Christians by turning us into just another “special interest” group to be appeased by meaningless symbolism. Meanwhile, the growth of government spending and regulation continues unchecked. In his comments posted yesterday, Dobson discussed at length his personal commitment to freedom and limited government. Therefore, we should take him at face value that he is a man dedicated to liberty and small government. That being the case, I’m sure he agrees that the action by Congress in the Terri Schiavo situation was a trespass against the separation of powers and an affront to conservatives’ historic resistance to judicial activism and interventionism. Clearly we cannot find judicial activism acceptable in cases when it is ordered by a legislative body. If we do find that acceptable, we might consider the damage that future liberal legislative bodies can wreak. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If Dobson is a champion of freedom, he understands then the risks of using the power of government to define social norms. We might not like what others have to say on these issues when they are in power. If Dobson is a defender of the Constitution, he will pause before calling for amending it on every social issue of the day. When you boil it down, this debate centers on the role of two critical ideas: freedom and righteousness. In our private lives, living righteously is paramount. However, in our public lives — in our relationship with policymakers and our government — we should resist the belief that the power of government should be used to force righteous behavior in others. That’s the temptation facing religious conservatives. Indeed, such efforts to impose righteousness are doomed to fail — society cannot truly become righteous simply because the government compels “righteous” behavior. God gave us free will, and true righteousness can only be found through a free exercise of personal choice. Although Dobson may not realize it, government-mandated righteousness is a pathway to tyranny. The goal for Christians in our public lives, then, must be freedom — freedom to practice our faith without government interference. Freedom to build churches and schools and businesses without being forced to supplicate before an ever-expanding government leviathan. When we defend values, we win; when we impose values, we lose. Jim Dobson is correct that if evangelicals stay home, Republicans lose. On the other hand, equally true, is the fact that if pocketbook voters stay home, we lose (as was the case in 2002, 1998, and in 1992). This election cycle, it is my belief that Americans are more concerned with basic pocketbook issues, and the 109th Congress has failed to address those concerns. All officeholders must come to terms with the fact that they are expected to deal with substantive legislative outcomes, not just political posturing and pandering. The electorate holds them accountable. Indeed, pandering and posturing on gay marriage is an insult to most voters. I’m the first person to argue that marriage is between a man and a woman. But here, Jim Dobson himself is prone to hyperbole, having claimed in one campaign speech that homosexuals and gay marriage “will destroy the earth.” We should leave such rhetoric to Al Gore, where it is better suited. Jim Dobson would have us believe that we, as conservatives and Republicans, face a stark political choice: His way, defeat or nothing. However, a Republican Party that believes its first value is righteousness over freedom is a party that will lose elections. There is a better answer than Dobson’s Choice. The Republican Party needs to find a common ground, as President Reagan did, that unites all factions of the GOP coalition. I argue that the common ground is personal liberty and limited government. More fundamentally, freedom is a “tent” in which all Americans, including evangelical Christians, will prosper. Dick Armey, a Republican, represented Texas' 26th Congressional District in the House of Representatives from 1985 to 2003 and was the Majority Leader of the House from 1995 to 2003. He is now chairman of FreedomWorks. In his current position, he has traveled to more than 20 states, rallying grassroots, testifying before state and federal governments, meeting with pro-reform legislators, and challenging “backsliding” politicians while helping advance FreedomWorks’ mission of lower taxes, less government and more freedom. Armey has written four books: \\"Price Theory: A Policy-Welfare Approach\\" (1977), \\"The Freedom Revolution\\" (1995), \\"The Flat Tax\\" (1996), and \\"Armey's Axioms\\" (2003).

That comes on top of a 9% increase in annual premiums to cover a family of four, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most of that increase comes from rising health care costs, said Gary Claxton, director of Kaiser's Health Care Marketplace Project. \\"It might be that the discussion going on with the debt is just as important,\\" Claxton said. If health care spending is cut by the deficit \\"supercommittee,\\" \\"then those providers will look to get some of that back elsewhere.\\" That, he said, will make it harder for private insurance companies to negotiate for lower rates for employers and privately insured individuals. The 12-member supercommittee must create a plan to reduce the federal debt by 1.5 trillion by Nov. 23, and Congress must vote on it by Dec. 23. It's impossible to predict the supercommittee's results, said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans. But offering less government health coverage could hurt those who do pay for insurance. \\"Historically, these costs get shifted to people with private coverage,\\" he said. A growing number of uninsured and underinsured Americans means the \\"deductible is constantly rising for the privately insured,\\" said Quentin Young, national coordinator for Physicians for a National Health Program. That group advocates for a single-payer health system. Kaiser's survey found that annual insurance premiums to cover people through their employers average 5,429 for single people and 15,073 for a family of four in 2011. Those rates rose 8% for single people and 9% for families. In 2010, premiums rose just 3% for families from the previous year. Kaiser Family Foundation also found premiums were lower for families at small firms than for those at large firms. \\"I don't think it is a big difference from what we've seen for a long time,\\" Claxton said. Claxon estimated, based on Office of Management and Budget figures, that about 1% of the rise came from changes due to last year's health care law, allowing children up to age 26 to remain on their parents' insurance, and requiring preventive medical services, such as annual exams and colonoscopies, with no co-pay. The rest came from rising health care costs, though he said some insurers may have raised rates in expectation of higher health costs.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. and the situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Answer the following question: Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","response":"Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near his farm because his use of fertilizer is currently low. This means there will be less nitrogen-rich runoff entering the ponds, resulting in less algal overgrowth and oxygen depletion in the water."},{"question":"Please answer this question: Which is the only one of Shakespeare's comedies in which 'Falstaff' appears?","response":"The only comedy by Shakespeare where Falstaff, a funny and kind of chubby character, shows up is called \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor.\\" It's like a play where people laugh and enjoy seeing Falstaff trying to do silly things but ending up in funny situations instead."},{"question":"Mary Christine Brockert (March 5, 1956 - December 26, 2010), better known by her stage name Teena Marie, was an American singer-songwriter, and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina before taking the stage name Teena Marie and later acquired the nickname Lady Tee (sometimes spelled Lady T), given to her by her collaborator and friend, Rick James. She was known for her distinctive soulful vocals, which caused many listeners to believe she was African-American. Her success in R&B and soul music, and loyalty to these genres would earn her the title Ivory Queen of Soul. Mary Christine, or Tina as she was called, was the daughter of construction worker Thomas Leslie Brockert and his wife, home renovator Mary Anne. She spent her early childhood in Mission Hills, Calif. Her ethnic heritage was Portuguese, Italian, Irish, and American Indian. In 2005, while visiting Louisiana, she had discovered that her paternal ancestors once lived in New Orleans. She took to singing naturally, performing Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat Song by age two. She also developed a fondness for singing Motown songs, and her self-professed \\"gift from God\\" would become fine-tuned as the years progressed. When she was eight years old, her parents began sending Tina on auditions which, among other things, netted her an acting role on The Beverly Hillbillies, credited as Tina Marie Brockert. She also sang at the wedding of Jerry Lewis' son when she was 10 years old. Reared in a Roman Catholic household, she learned to play the piano under the tutelage of two nuns, and later taught herself the guitar, bass, and congas. She would go on to form a semi-professional R&B band with her younger brother Anthony and their cousin. In the early 1970s, after the family moved to Venice, Los Angeles, Brockert spent her adolescent years in the historically black Venice enclave of Oakwood, nicknamed \\"Venice Harlem\\". There, she would acquire a strong spiritual influence from neighborhood matriarch Berthalynn Jackson, a black woman who would become her godmother. While attending Venice High School, Brockert joined the Summer Dance Production and was the female lead in the school's production of The Music Man. She also fronted a local Venice rock band \\"Truvair\\" in 1974-1975; the band's members were her high school classmates. Following graduation, Brockert juggled auditioning for various record companies with studying English Literature at Santa Monica College. She credited her love of reading with helping her to write lyrics.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was in her family?","response":"In her family was her father, construction worker Thomas Leslie Brockert, her mother, home renovator Mary Anne, and her younger brother Anthony.

Because Captain Jack Sparrow, one of the Pirate Lords, never named a successor, before being killed, Captain Barbossa, along with Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Tia Dalma, and the crew of the Black Pearl, plot to rescue Jack from Davy Jones's Locker. Travelling to Singapore, the crew meet Captain Sao Feng who owns navigational charts to the Locker and quickly gains an unpredictable interest in Elizabeth. Beckett's soldiers invade, but the crew escape. Feng and Turner make a deal to give Jack to Feng, so he in turn can use the Pearl to rescue his father Bootstrap Bill from the Flying Dutchman. The crew travels to the locker and rescues the marooned Jack. They find themselves trapped, encountering dead souls, including Elizabeth's father Governor Swann. They learn the Dutchman must have a captain. Returning to the living world, the Pearl is attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men.

To better understand the role and function of the pituitary gland and its production of TSH, let's delve deeper into the subject. The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain, just below the hypothalamus. It is often referred to as the \\"master gland\\" because it regulates various functions in the body through the secretion of hormones. The pituitary gland consists of two main parts: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary, each responsible for different hormone production and regulation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is one of the key hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. The secretion of TSH is stimulated by the Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is produced in the hypothalamus. When the hypothalamus detects low levels of thyroid hormones in the blood, it releases TRH, which then signals the anterior pituitary to produce and secrete TSH. TSH has a vital role in regulating the body's metabolism, growth, and development through its interaction with the thyroid gland, which is located in the front of the neck. The primary function of TSH is to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce and release two major hormones: Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones play a critical role in regulating the body's metabolism, energy production, and overall maintenance of homeostasis. In summary, the master gland of the body, the pituitary gland, is responsible for producing Thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH. This hormone plays a pivotal role in maintaining the body's overall health and metabolic functions by stimulating the thyroid gland to produce and secrete essential thyroid hormones. Among the given options, TSH is the accurate answer as it aligns with the key function of the pituitary gland."},{"question":"Q: Given a 'poster' sentence and a corresponding 'response' (often, from Facebook or Reddit)classify the sentiment of the given response into four categories: 1) Positive, 2) Negative, 3) Neutral, and 4) Mixed if it contains both positive and negative.

In both sentences, \\"a man\\" is the subject and \\"a pool\\" is the object. Step 2: Analyze the actions in both sentences. In Sentence 1, the action is \\"dives\\" (past tense). In Sentence 2, the action is \\"is diving\\" (present continuous). Step 3: Compare the actions and determine their similarity. The verb \\"to dive\\" is the same in both sentences. The difference lies in the tense: Sentence 1 refers to a completed action, and Sentence 2 refers to an ongoing action. Step 4: Decide on the level of meaning overlap between the sentences. Although the tenses are different, the overall meaning of both sentences is quite similar - a man is performing the action of diving into a pool.

Options: (A) 150 (B) 88 (C) 2767 (D) 288 (E) 712","response":"To answer this question, I'll first analyze the given data and recall the relevant formula. We are given the speed of the train (60 km/hr) and the time it takes to cross a pole (9 seconds). The objective is to find the length of the train. Before calculating, we should convert the speed to a consistent unit of measurement. The speed is given in km/hr, which needs to be converted into meters/second. To do this conversion, we can use the following rule: 1 km/hr = (1000 meters/3600 seconds) Now, let's convert the given speed: 60 km/hr * (1000 meters/1 km) * (1 hr/3600 seconds) = (60*1000)/3600 meters/second = (60*10/36) meters/second = 50/3 meters/second Now, thinking about the formula we need to use, we can use the formula for distance or length: Length = Speed * Time We know the time is 9 seconds and the converted speed is 50/3 meters/second. Using the formula, Length = Speed * Time, we'll find the length of the train: Length = (50/3 meters/second) * (9 seconds) Length = 150 meters Thus, the answer is (A) 150."},{"question":"John is interested in the history of science.

After the 1994 release of The Downward Spiral, the live band embarked on the Self-Destruct tour in support of the album. Chris Vrenna and James Woolley performed drums and keyboards respectively, Robin Finck replaced Richard Patrick on guitar and bassist Danny Lohner was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down for visuals shown during songs such as \\"Hurt\\". The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very little actual ones. The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.The tour included a set at Woodstock '94 broadcast on Pay-per-view and seen in as many as 24 million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair going into his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have \\"stolen the show\\" from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded. The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements. Its performance of \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" from the Woodstock concert earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1995. Entertainment Weekly commented about the band's Woodstock '94 performance: \\"Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core--an experience as draining as it is exhilarating\\".

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. Paragraph: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is the shielding effect in atom S higher or lower than in atom L? Answer:","response":"The shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L. This is due to the fact that the size of an atom generally increases as we go down a group in the periodic table. Consequently, as atoms get larger, the distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons increases. In addition to the increased distance, there are more inner electrons present in a larger atom, which results in a greater shielding effect. As the shielding effect is determined by the combined effect of all the inner electrons on the outermost electron(s), the larger number of inner electrons in atom L leads to a higher shielding effect in comparison to atom S. The higher shielding effect in atom L contributes to its lower ionization energy, as the valence electron experiences a weaker attractive force from the nucleus, thus requiring less energy to remove it from the atom. In summary, the shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L due to the smaller size of atom S and the lesser number of inner electrons present, rendering a weaker shielding effect on its valence electron(s)."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore.

Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

To deduce this assumption, we need to analyze some key elements in the sentence. Firstly, the phrase \\"a woman standing outside\\" presents a basic setting, indicating that a woman is standing outdoors. It does not provide any information about her relationship with the man in this scenario. Secondly, the woman is described as \\"leaning against a shovel which is in a bucket.\\" This provides some insight into what she is doing, suggesting that she might be involved in some form of work or chore. However, merely leaning on a shovel may indicate that she is resting, waiting, or even arranging the scene. It is not a strong indicator of her actively performing the chore. Thirdly, the sentence continues with \\"as she stares at a man with a green cap.\\" The act of staring at the man suggests that the woman is involved in some interaction with him. However, it does not provide any indication of whether they are cooperating in a joint task, whether they are sharing a romantic connection, or whether there is any other type of interaction between them. To deduce that \\"A couple is doing chores together\\" from the given statement, we would require more information. For instance, if the description included the two individuals talking or working on a common task together, it would provide stronger evidence for the shared chore assumption. Moreover, other contextual clues would be needed to support the idea that they are romantically involved and form a couple. In conclusion, while it is possible to infer that both individuals might be engaged in some form of chore or activity, the given statement alone does not provide sufficient evidence to confidently state that \\"A couple is doing chores together.\\" More information about the context and relationship between the two individuals would be needed to validate such a conclusion."},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that Cameron finds is missing? is inside the article: The Clinic is set in the year 1978 (six years prior to the advent of DNA testing).

In a series of photographs, Ilja, 34, and 29-year-old Mark are seen showcasing their champagne lifestyle during their stay at the five-star Schweizerhof hotel in Lucerne. The photographs were posted on Instagram by Ilya’s girlfriend Anna Kazakova, 28, who joined the brothers and Mark’s girlfriend Natasha Dovgjalo on the trip. Last night, Hannah Smith’s father David condemned the pictures as ‘insensitive and disgusting’. ‘They are going round shamelessly living the high life while I’ve lost my daughter and had to sell my home,’ he said. ‘They have blood on their hands but they couldn’t care less. This is money they made on a site that killed my daughter, Hannah, so I don’t know how they can live with themselves.’ High life: Ilya Terebin and girlfriend Anna Kazakova enjoy a dinner together during their holiday. Snappy: The father of the two men, Oleg, said it was 'nonsense' to blame ask.fm for the death of Hannah Smith. Yacht: Mark Terebin was picture here aboard the luxury yacht he hired out during his holiday in Switzerland. Exclusive: Mark Terebin was pictured previously in the US alongside this top of the range sports car. Mr Smith, a lorry driver, explained why he sold the family home in Leicestershire at a loss of £20,000. ‘Hannah’s sister Joanna and I couldn’t be in that house any more. Joanna was the one who found Hannah and she couldn’t go back upstairs after that, so we had no choice but to sell.’ Last week, friends of 14-year-old Izzy Dix, who was found hanged at her home in Devon on September 17, blamed bullying on ask.fm for her death and vowed to fight to have the site shut down. Millionaires: Mark Terebin and his brother Ilya make an annual profit of £5 million through ask.fm. Condemned: Hannah Smith's father David branded Ilya Terebin (pictured) and brother Mark 'insensitive' Attack: Oleg Terebin demanded people 'stop spreading rumours' about his sons' website ask.fm. But speaking last week, the tycoons’ father Oleg said it was ‘nonsense’ to blame ask.fm or his sons. ‘Stop spreading these rumours,’ he added. ‘Are you saying this girl didn’t communicate with anyone else – teachers, parents, and friends?’ Asked whether his sons should do more to prevent bullying on the site, he snapped: ‘I don’t know what you are talking about.’ Ask.fm initially offered to name the trolls who bullied Hannah Smith. It has also said it is improving security. But a source at the site, which makes £5 million a year in advertising revenue, later claimed that she sent most of the abuse to herself. Yesterday, an ask.fm spokesman said: ‘The brothers did attend, along with several hundred other people, the wedding of a good friend in Switzerland. 'It would have been impolite not to join in toasts to the happy couple. We hope Mr Smith understands this, given the circumstances.’ Disgusted: David Smith, pictured here with daughter Jo, is outraged after the photographs of ask.fm owners appeared online. Last month Mr Smith's daughter Hannah committed suicide after being bullied. Tragic: Teenager Hannah Smith committed suicide last month after being bullied on ask.fm. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"This article is about a father, David Smith, who is very upset because his daughter, Hannah, took her own life after being bullied online on a website called ask.fm. The people who made the website, Ilja and Mark Terebin, went on a fancy trip to Switzerland, which made David Smith feel worse. He thinks they don't care about what happened to his daughter. Another 14-year-old girl, Izzy Dix, also took her own life and some people think the website ask.fm played a part in that too. The website is trying to make some changes to be safer and stop mean people from bullying others."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given five sentences, numbered 1 through 5, and two options a and b for possible titles for the story.

Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought..., what would be the answer ? A:","response":"The last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court is Monteverdi. Claudio Monteverdi maintained contact with Striggio and other Gonzaga courtiers, which allowed him to receive these commissions, such as the composition of Le nozze di Tetide for the celebration of Duke Ferdinando's upcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici."},{"question":"Is the following statement true? \\"Menstruation controls the production and release of eggs and the cyclic release of estrogen and progesterone.\\" Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","response":"The statement is partially true, but it requires some clarification. The menstrual cycle, not menstruation itself, controls the production and release of eggs and the cyclic release of estrogen and progesterone. Menstruation is just one phase of the menstrual cycle. Here's the chain of thought and solution for this question: 1. The menstrual cycle is a roughly 28-day natural process that occurs in women's bodies and involves a series of hormonal changes and physiological events associated with the reproductive system. Its main purpose is to prepare the female body for potential pregnancy. 2. The menstrual cycle can be divided into several phases: the menstrual phase, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. 3. The menstrual phase, commonly known as menstruation, is when the thickened lining of the uterus (endometrium) is shed, accompanied by bleeding. This phase usually lasts between 3-7 days. 4. The follicular phase begins on the first day of menstruation and continues until ovulation. During this phase, the pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the growth of several ovarian follicles (each containing an immature egg) in the ovary. The follicles produce estrogen, which helps to rebuild the endometrium and causes it to thicken. 5. Ovulation occurs around the 14th day of the menstrual cycle when a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicle into the fallopian tube, in response to a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) produced by the pituitary gland. This process is crucial for potential fertilization if sperm is present. 6. The luteal phase starts after ovulation and lasts until the beginning of the next menstrual phase. The ovarian follicle that released the egg transforms into the corpus luteum, which releases the hormone progesterone. Progesterone further prepares the endometrium for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, and progesterone levels drop, leading to the shedding of the endometrium and the beginning of the next menstrual phase. In conclusion, it is the menstrual cycle that controls the production and release of eggs as well as the cyclic release of estrogen and progesterone, ultimately regulating the reproductive function in women. Menstruation is just one part of this complex process."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - A tithe (from Old English: \\"teogoþa\\" \\"tenth\\") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government. Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques, or stocks, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products.

Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England.

Anomalies in the parochial system, they had no church or clergymen and were therefore exempt from payment of poor or church rates and usually tithes. They were formed for a variety of reasons, often because an area was unpopulated or unsuitable for agriculture, but also around institutions and buildings or natural resources. Extra-parochial areas caused considerable problems when they became inhabited as they did not provide religious facilities, local governance or provide for the relief of the poor. Their status was often ambiguous and there was demand for extra-parochial areas to operate more like parishes. Following the introduction of the New Poor Law, extra-parochial areas were effectively made civil parishes by the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857 and were eliminated by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1868. This was achieved either by being integrated with a neighbouring or surrounding parish, or by becoming a separate civil parish if the population was high enough. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county.

The Wilson burger and pulled pork sandwich are my favorites. Is this review positive or negative?","response":"This review is positive. The user specifically mentions that the food is \\"delicious,\\" expressing overall satisfaction with the taste and quality. In addition, they point out two specific items from the menu, which are the Wilson burger and the pulled pork sandwich, labeling them as their \\"favorites\\". This further strengthens the positive nature of the review as it shows that the user not only enjoyed the overall food experience but also had signature items they particularly loved. Furthermore, word choices like 'favorites' and 'delicious' connote a strong sense of approval and satisfaction, which are indicative of a positive review. The reviewer does not mention any negative elements such as bad service, high prices, low quality, or unpalatable dishes, which typically feature in negative reviews. Although without more context or further elaboration, and recognizing that reviews can be very subjective, it remains safe to assume that this is a positive review. The customer’s choices of words showed positivity, and they are promoting two of the products thereby recommending them to others. Finally, in judging customer reviews, it's also essential to remember that tone, context, and relative comparison to other products or experiences can also affect the analysis.

Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band.

I respect Cardi B, but I personally think Nicki Minaj has more versatility and her lyrics are much more creative. Plus, she's been in the industry for a long time, making her a true rap icon. Trevor: Yeah, but Cardi B has shown a lot of growth since she started! She really knows how to create catchy hooks and her flow is just great. She's also not afraid to be herself, which I think is a major plus. Jay: True, Cardi B has a unique style and bold personality. However, don't you think Nicki Minaj is more consistent with her work? Her discography is more diverse, and you can't deny her multiple hit songs and features over the years. Trevor: Sure, she's had plenty of hits, but I think the reason I prefer Cardi B is that she comes across as more genuine. She's always been open about her past, both the good and the bad, and how she's worked hard to get to where she is now. That's something I really respect. Jay: I do admire Cardi B's authenticity, but don't you think Nicki Minaj's experience in the industry has given her a unique perspective that's reflected in her music? Also, her ability to switch up her style from rap to pop and still be successful in both genres is quite impressive. Trevor: Cardi B has also experimented with different genres. Plus, in a shorter amount of time, she achieved a lot of milestones, like her debut album, 'Invasion of Privacy,' which broke records and won a Grammy for Best Rap Album. She's managed to accomplish a lot in just a few years. Jay: That's true, and Cardi B's impact on the industry is undeniable. However, Nicki Minaj has had a much longer career and has also been nominated for multiple Grammys. And not to mention, she's an amazing lyricist who has inspired both male and female rappers alike. Trevor: While it's true that Nicki Minaj is a trendsetter and has been around longer, I still believe Cardi B has the potential to surpass her over time. Cardi's raw talent, distinct style, and genuine personality resonate more with me, and I can't wait to see her grow even more as an artist. Jay: Well, it's clear that we have our own preferences, and that's the beauty of music and art - there's something for everyone. I still prefer Nicki Minaj, but I can appreciate what Cardi B brings to the table as well. It's always great to have a healthy debate about our favorite artists! Trevor: Definitely! I'm glad we can have such open and honest discussions about our musical tastes, and who knows, maybe there will be a collaboration between Nicki Minaj and Cardi B one day that we will both love!

Cleg has just been released from a mental institution and in his new abode starts piecing together or recreating in his memory an apparently fateful childhood event. He roams the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal and starts to relive or visualize a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother and his father. A shift takes place in the child's psyche when he witnesses his mother groping with his father in the garden and, subsequently, when he sees his mother in a silky night gown she wore for his father. The son, as a grown man seems to recreate in his memory the buildup to his father's murder of his mother with the passive support of a prostitute he is involved with, who then moves into the house and is presented as his mother. The young son then kills the mistress by gassing her in the kitchen, although the final shot appears to show his true mother lying dead so we are left to wonder whether she really was his mother and the prostitute was just a fantasy.

Since the question lists possible outcomes such as relaxation, enjoyment, arguments, going abroad, and spending money, it is essential to address each of these aspects individually in order to provide a comprehensive response. 1. Relaxation: A well-planned vacation can offer a much-needed break for couples by providing an opportunity to relax and unwind. However, disagreements during the planning stage might hamper this intended goal of relaxation. For instance, if one partner prefers a peaceful and serene holiday destination, while the other wants an action-packed adventure trip, this disparity in preferences can elevate stress levels rather than promoting relaxation. 2. Enjoyment: Ideally, a vacation should be an enjoyable experience for both individuals. But when disagreements arise during planning, the joy of anticipating and experiencing the holiday might be diluted. Conflicting interests, priorities, and expectations can lead to resentment and frustration, making it difficult for the couple to enjoy the vacation as anticipated. 3. Arguments: Disagreements during vacation planning can certainly lead to arguments and tensions between a couple. This might arise from differing opinions about the choice of destination, budget allocation, and individual preferences regarding activities and experiences. Unresolved arguments can not only affect the dynamics between the couple but also create an unpleasant atmosphere during the vacation. 4. Going Abroad: Planning a vacation abroad can be particularly challenging for couples experiencing disagreements. Factors such as selecting a destination, visa requirements, and language barriers can amplify the differences between them. In cases where both partners have trouble reaching a compromise, they might end up choosing a domestic location to avoid complications associated with traveling to a foreign country. 5. Spending Money: Financial considerations play a significant role in vacation planning. Disagreements regarding the vacation budget or how money should be spent can cause tension between a couple. One partner might prioritize luxury accommodation and fine dining, while the other may have a more frugal approach and want to invest in unique experiences or prioritize the overall budget. These differences in perspective can cause friction and might require negotiations to balance both parties' needs and wishes. In conclusion, while planning a vacation can offer relaxation and enjoyment for a couple, disagreements during this process can lead to arguments and differences in opinions regarding going abroad and spending money. Effective communication, compromise, and mutual understanding are essential to navigate these disagreements successfully and make the vacation a memorable and happy experience for both partners. By respecting each other's preferences and prioritizing the overall well-being of the relationship, couples can create a harmonious and satisfying vacation experience."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil.

Question: What piece by Vivaldi is used as a cliche to convey opulence?","response":"The piece by Antonio Vivaldi that is most frequently used as a cliché to convey refinement, opulence, and sophistication is \\"The Four Seasons,\\" which is a group of four violin concertos collectively known as \\"Le quattro stagioni.\\" Each concerto represents one of the four seasons: Spring (La primavera), Summer (L'estate), Autumn (L'autunno), and Winter (L'inverno). Vivaldi's \\"The Four Seasons\\" was composed in 1723 and is one of the most popular and recognized examples of the Baroque music era. Each concerto is composed in three movements, with a fast-slow-fast tempo structure. These concertos are characterized by their virtuosic violin solos and vivid programmatic writing, which is meant to evoke the sounds, moods, and images of each season. In addition to the music, Vivaldi also provided sonnets detailing the narrative and emotions for each season. The iconic status and widespread appeal of \\"The Four Seasons\\" in popular culture can be attributed to several factors: 1. Musical accessibility: The memorable melodies, rhythms, and harmonies in the concertos make them easily accessible for listeners, even for those who are not well-acquainted with classical music. 2. Visual and narrative appeal: The programmatic nature of \\"The Four Seasons\\" allows audiences to relate to and visualize the natural and emotional associations with each season, making it more engaging. 3. Versatility: Individual movements or sections of \\"The Four Seasons\\" can be excerpted and used for various purposes in media, such as to convey a sense of grandeur, luxury, or magnificence. 4. Familiarity: The Four Seasons has been reinterpreted, adapted, and sampled in various film scores, television shows, advertisements, and even contemporary music, which reinforces its status as a cultural icon and cliché.

Lara finds this orb, as well as a strange medallion; but both are stolen by the crime lord Chen Lo (Simon Yam). Lara (Angelina Jolie) only just manages to escape as a subsequent earthquake causes the Luna Temple to collapse, while her two companions are killed by Chen's men.

It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi...., can you guess it ?

But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef! \\"Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,\\" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. \\"Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too.\\" Although it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. \\"We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,\\" Dr. Vincent says. \\"When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell.\\" Those who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. \\"I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,\\" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. \\"But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all.\\" Meat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year.

Movie title: The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance Movie plot: Senator Ransom \\"Ranse\\" Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive by train in the frontier town of Shinbone, in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him. When Stoddard, the naive \\"pilgrim\\" (as Doniphon dubs him), opens a law practice in town, Doniphon and many others believe him crazy for inviting retribution from Valance, who cannot abide any challenge to his \\"authority\\". Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie. When Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien), publisher of the local newspaper, offers him a revolver, however, he accepts...

Questions: What could you do to a river when you go fishing? Options: - buy bait - catch fish - drop fish - wade in - catching fish Answer:","response":"When you go fishing in a river, the option that is most in line with common sense would be to \\"catch fish.\\" This is because the primary purpose of going fishing is to actually catch fish. It is important, however, to understand why the other options are not as suitable: 1. Buy bait: While buying bait is a necessary step to prepare for a fishing trip, it is not something you do \\"to a river.\\" Buying bait typically takes place at a bait shop or store away from the river. Additionally, this option is more of a pre-requisite rather than an action taken during the actual act of fishing. 2. Drop fish: This option does not make sense in the context of going fishing in a river. It is neither a common nor practical approach to fishing. In general, when you go fishing, your goal is to catch fish, not to bring fish to the river only to release them back into the water. 3. Wade in: While wading into a river is an action that someone might take during a fishing trip, it's not the primary goal of the fishing experience. Wading in a river is simply a way to gain access to a better fishing spot, but it does not directly contribute to catching fish. It's an auxiliary action rather than the main purpose of the trip. 4. Catching fish: This option is essentially the same as \\"catch fish,\\" but it is written in a different form (the continuous form of the verb). It goes without saying that catching fish is an integral part of a fishing trip. However, the prompt asks you to pick an option that is in line with common sense to answer the question, and \\"catch fish\\" is the more concise and standard way of describing that action. In conclusion, the most appropriate response to the question \\"What could you do to a river when you go fishing?\\" is to \\"catch fish,\\" as this is the main objective of a fishing trip and represents a sensible action you would undertake while fishing."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...

Early forms of the Church Educational System Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the \\"Domestic Organization\\", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In certain cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure. Both LDS and non-LDS students are required to meet annually with a Church leader to receive an ecclesiastical endorsement for both acceptance and continuance. Various LGBT advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being anti-gay, and The Princeton Review ranked BYU as the 3rd most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

But the Globes have provided murky forecasts in recent times. In the last six years, only a single recipient of one of the Globe best-film prizes has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars _ 2008's \\"Slumdog Millionaire.\\" That came after a stretch of eight-straight years when a Globe winner in either the dramatic or musical-comedy category went on to claim the best-picture Oscar. Like the Globes, the Oscars will feature 10 best-picture nominees, but in a single category, after academy overseers doubled the number of contenders so a broader range of films could compete. With two acclaimed dramas _ \\"The King's Speech\\" and \\"The Social Network\\" _ considered front-runners this time, there are prospects of another divergent year between the Globes and the Oscars, whose nominations come out Jan. 25, nine days after the Globes are presented. \\"The Social Network\\" already has snagged two key prizes as both Los Angeles and New York film critics groups picked it as the year's best movie. The National Board of Review, a group of film historians, educators and students, also picked \\"The Social Network\\" as best of the year. The Globes and Oscars typically line up better on acting winners. Last year, \\"Avatar\\" won best drama at the Globes and \\"The Hurt Locker\\" took best picture at the Oscars. But all four Oscar acting recipients _ Sandra Bullock for \\"The Blind Side,\\" Jeff Bridges for \\"Crazy Heart,\\" Mo'Nique for \\"Precious\\" and Christoph Waltz for \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" _ also won prizes at the Globes first. Clear favorites have emerged this season for best actor (Firth in \\"The King's Speech\\") and supporting actor (Bale in \\"The Fighter\\"). Bening for \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" and Portman for \\"Black Swan\\" could wind up in a two-woman race for best actress at the Oscars, while the supporting-actress category is up for grabs among prospects that include Adams and Leo for \\"The Fighter,\\" Bonham Carter for \\"The King's Speech\\" and 14-year-old newcomer Hailee Steinfeld for \\"True Grit.\\" No matter how the two awards shows line up on winners, the stars generally can count on a good time at the Globes, a more laid-back, dinner-and-drinks affair than the stately Oscars. The Globes are presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 85 critics and reporters for overseas outlets. Robert De Niro, an eight-time Globe nominee who won a best-actor prize there for \\"Raging Bull,\\" will receive the group's Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement.

The tires of the toy car would get more warm when it is pushed over the (A) wooden table (B) grass. Choose the answer between \\"wooden table\\" and \\"grass\\". The answer is:","response":"A) Wooden Table The answer to the logic test is \\"wooden table.\\" There are several factors to consider when determining why the tires of a toy car would get warmer when pushed across a wooden table rather than grass. This analysis will include an exploration of friction, heat generation, and the properties of the two different surfaces. 1. Friction: Friction plays a crucial role in the temperature change of an object. When an object is in motion across a surface, the friction between the two materials generates heat. The force of friction depends on the smoothness of the surfaces in contact and the pressure applied to push the object. In the case of a toy car being pushed across a wooden table, the force of friction would be greater than if pushed across grass. This is because the table likely has a smoother and harder surface compared to the uneven and soft nature of grass. The increased friction on the wooden table would generate more heat, making the tires of the toy car warmer in comparison. 2. Heat Generation: As mentioned earlier, the interaction between the toy car's tires and the wooden table or grass surface would result in heat generation. A smoother and harder surface, like the wooden table, would create a more direct and consistent contact with the toy car's tires, resulting in higher heat generation. Conversely, the softer and uneven surface of grass would absorb some of the energy caused by the friction, leading to less direct contact with the toy car's tires and thus, decreasing the resulting heat. 3. Material Properties: Wood and grass possess different properties that affect temperature accumulation and dissipation. Wooden tables are typically solid and dense, which means they don't have as many pockets of air that can absorb the heat. As a result, heat builds up in the area of contact between the toy car's tires and the table, making the tires warmer. On the other hand, grass is a less dense and more flexible material. Its structure and water content allow it to dissipate heat more effectively due to the increased number of air pockets and lower thermal conductivity. Consequently, the heat generated by the friction between the toy car's tires and the grass would be more quickly absorbed and dissipated, resulting in cooler tires. In conclusion, considering friction, heat generation, and the properties of the two surfaces, the tires of a toy car would get warmer when pushed across a wooden table compared to grass."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: To learn more about Network Policy and Access Services, open one of the following MMC snap-ins and then press F1 to display the Help:","response":"Для изучения более подробной информации о политике сети и службах доступа откройте один из следующих модулей MMC и затем нажмите F1, чтобы отобразить справку:"},{"question":"Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Human beings have a natural desire to explore the unknown. People with a strong interest in space like to say it is the last place left to explore. But scientists are warning that space exploration for long periods is not going to be easy. They say the human body is not designed to stay in space over an extended period. The New York Times recently published a report about scientists who are preparing astronauts for a trip to the Moon. The newspaper said the scientists want to make sure that their crews return home in good health. But there are many problems to be solved before people are ready for long trips to the Moon, an asteroid or even the planet Mars. Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity. Five years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth. There are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field. In...

Due to a fire outbreak in one of the factories, the price of RAM increased by 30%. After two years, the price stabilized and finally fell by 20% from what it has risen. What is the current price of RAM if it was 50 before the fire? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Determine the price increase due to the fire To find the increased price after the fire outbreak, we'll first need to calculate the 30% increase. To do this, multiply the original price of 50 by 30% (or 0.3 in decimal form). 50 * 0.3 = 15 Step 2: Find the new price after the fire Now that we have the price increase of 15, we can add that to the original price to get the new price after the fire: 50 (original price) + 15 (increase) = 65 Step 3: Determine the price decrease after two years After two years, the price fell by 20% from what it has risen (i.e., the 65 price). We need to find the 20% decrease by multiplying 65 by 20% (or 0.2 in decimal form). 65 * 0.2 = 13 Step 4: Find the current price of RAM Finally, to get the current price of RAM, we subtract the price decrease from the increased price: 65 (increased price) - 13 (decrease) = 52 The current price of RAM is 52."},{"question":"The speed of a boat in still water is 60kmph and the speed of the current is 20kmph. Find the speed downstream and upstream? Options: (A) 80,70 kmph (B) 87,40 kmph (C) 80,40 kmph (D) 70,40 kmph (E) 80,44 kmph Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","response":"To solve this problem, you need to understand the concepts of downstream and upstream. Downstream: When the boat is moving in the same direction as the current, the boat's speed and the current's speed work together. The effective speed of the boat downstream is equal to the sum of the boat's speed in still water and the speed of the current. Upstream: When the boat is moving against the current, the speed of the boat in still water works against the current's speed. The effective speed of the boat upstream is equal to the difference between the boat's speed in still water and the speed of the current. Given: Speed of the boat in still water: 60 kmph Speed of the current: 20 kmph Now let's find the speed downstream and upstream. Downstream speed: Speed of boat + speed of current = 60 kmph + 20 kmph = 80 kmph Upstream speed: Speed of boat - speed of current = 60 kmph - 20 kmph = 40 kmph So, the speed downstream is 80 kmph and the speed upstream is 40 kmph. The correct answer is option (C) 80,40 kmph."},{"question":"Pour remédier à ce problème, les Etats membres sont fortement encouragés à mettre en œuvre des dispositions prévoyant la suspension des délais de prescription.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

He served for most of his career as professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. If we accept that \\"mental illness\\" is a euphemism for behaviors that are disapproved of, then the state has no right to force psychiatric \\"treatment\\" on these individuals. Similarly, the state should not be able to interfere in mental health practices between consenting adults (for example, by legally controlling the supply of psychotropic drugs or psychiatric medication). The medicalization of government produces a \\"therapeutic state\\", designating someone as, for example, \\"insane\\" or as a \\"drug addict\\". In Ceremonial Chemistry (1973), he argued that the same persecution that targeted witches, Jews, gypsies, and homosexuals now targets \\"drug addicts\\" and \\"insane\\" people. Szasz argued that all these categories of people were taken as scapegoats of the community in ritual ceremonies. To underscore this continuation of religion through medicine, he even takes as example obesity: instead of concentrating on junk food (ill-nutrition), physicians denounced hypernutrition. According to Szasz, despite their scientific appearance, the diets imposed were a moral substitute to the former fasts, and the social injunction not to be overweight is to be considered as a moral order, not as a scientific advice as it claims to be. As with those thought bad (insane people), and those who took the wrong drugs (drug addicts), medicine created a category for those who had the wrong weight (obesity). Szasz argued that psychiatrics were created in the 17th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of social behavior; a new specialization, drogophobia, was created in the 20th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of drug consumption; and then, in the 1960s, another specialization, bariatrics, was created to deal with those who erred from the medical norms concerning the weight the body should have. Thus, he underscores that in 1970, the American Society of Bariatric Physicians (from the Greek baros baros, for \\"weight\\") had 30 members, and already 450 two years later.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is interesting about this article?","response":"Since the original text provided does not contain any specific article to quote from, I will instead provide a quote based on Thomas Stephen Szasz's views and elaborate on what is interesting about it. Quote from Thomas Szasz: “If you talk to God, you are praying; If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist; If you talk to the dead, you are a schizophrenic.” What is interesting about this quote and Szasz's views in general is his criticism of the way society and psychiatry label and categorize individuals based on their behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Szasz argues that this categorization often leads to a misunderstanding and oversimplification of complex human experiences. He was a strong believer in the idea that psychiatric diagnoses are not based on objective scientific criteria but rather on subjective judgments and cultural considerations. This quote illuminates his belief that the distinction between what is considered \\"normal\\" and \\"abnormal\\" or \\"mentally ill\\" is often arbitrary and heavily influenced by societal norms and expectations."},{"question":"Question: Which was the last ‘Star Wars’ film, released in 2008?

During some world series matches, a standing-room only ticket can go for 650 on the secondary market. This means that seats in the arcade can be sold for several thousand dollars.","response":"Step 1: Research ticket prices and availability First, I would research the current World Series ticket prices and their availability to get a better understanding of the potential cost and accessibility. This will help the user understand what to expect in terms of ticket prices, depending on the seating options they prefer. Step 2: Determine the budget and the desired seats Next, I would ask the user to determine their budget and the desired seat preferences (such as standing-room only, arcade, outfield, or premium seating). Having a clear budget and seating preferences in mind will help narrow down the ticket options. Step 3: Keep an eye on official ticket release dates It is important to monitor the official MLB website and World Series social media channels to stay updated on the official ticket release dates. This will allow the user to potentially purchase tickets at face value directly from the source. Step 4: Sign up for team newsletters and notifications I would recommend the user to sign up for newsletters and ticket notifications for both the participating teams and the hosting stadium. This way, they will receive updates on any possible pre-sales, promotions, or last-minute ticket releases. Step 5: Explore reliable secondary markets If tickets are sold out through the official channels, I would explore reliable secondary markets such as StubHub, SeatGeek, or Vivid Seats to find available tickets. It is important to verify the authenticity of these websites and to read user reviews to ensure a secure and trustworthy transaction. Step 6: Compare ticket prices and options When browsing through secondary markets, I would compare ticket prices and options while keeping the user's budget and seating preferences in mind. Be ready to act fast, as ticket prices can fluctuate on these platforms. Step 7: Choose the best option and purchase promptly Once the best option is found, I would advise the user to promptly purchase the tickets, as World Series tickets are in high demand and may sell out quickly. Also, to be cautious about sharing personal and financial information and use a secure payment method. Step 8: Verify the ticket delivery method After the purchase is complete, I would confirm the delivery method of the tickets, whether they will be sent via email, mobile app, or postal mail.

Quintanilla. Kumbia All Starz are not to be confused with Los Kumbia Kings although some members are originally from Los Kumbia Kings. Their 2006 debut album \\"Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz\\" reached number one on United States Billboard's Latin Pop Albums chart, number one on the Top Latin Albums chart, and number sixty-eight on the United States \\"Billboard\\" 200.

It began as a courtship dance practiced among the African population on the Caribbean coasts of Colombia and Panama. It later mixed with Amerindian and European instruments, steps and musical characteristics and spread throughout Latin America and abroad. While other genres of Latin American music have remained associated with specific countries or regions, cumbia has grown to be one of the most widespread and unifying musical genres to emerge from Latin America. - \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' is a song by Panamanian reggae singer El General featuring Anayca . The song was released in 1995 and is one of El General 's signature songs . \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' was later cover by Mexican - American cumbia group A.B.

Ricky Rick and Melissa Jiménez provide the vocals . - Edgardo Armando Franco, better known as El General, is a Panamanian reggae artist considered by some to be one of the fathers of \\"Reggae En Español\\". During the early 1990s, he initiated the Spanish spoken dancehall. Early examples of this were the international and somewhat mainstream songs, Te Ves Buena and Tu Pun Pun. Both songs, performed in Spanish rap, were very successful in North America. After getting his foot in the door of the commercial market, many other Spanish rappers became famous in the mainstream as well, such as Vico C and DJ Negro. He has a unique, easy to listen to style of dance music and has produced many well-known songs all over Latin America. His musical works have become popular in Latin America over the last few years. This style is called Reggae en Español, because he makes dancehall reggae music with Spanish-language lyrics. - Los Kumbia Kings was an American Mexican cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martinez. Their music encompasses the styles of cumbia (hence their name), hip hop, and R&B. They produce songs in both Spanish and English. The band's producers from the beginning have been Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez. Quintanilla is the brother of the late \\"Queen of Tejano\\", Selena. Quintanilla played bass guitar for the group, while Martínez, husband of international artist Alicia Villarreal, played keyboards. Both co-wrote songs for the Kumbia Kings. Though the group has gone through a revolving door of members in recent years amid controversy and finger-pointing, and the Kumbia Kings of today are vastly different from what originated in Corpus Christi over eight years ago, Quintanilla and Martínez were always the soul of the group. Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\". Martínez kept Los Kumbia Kings but changed the name to Los Super Reyes for legal issues. In October 2009, Quintanilla and Martínez solved their differences, and announced that the Kumbia Kings would reunite for a series of concerts lasting from late 2009 through early 2010. - Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Two of the biggest stars of the early dancehall era were Yellowman and Eek-a-Mouse. Dancehall brought a new generation of producers, including Linval Thompson, Gussie Clarke and Jah Thomas. In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \\"ragga\\") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. (The word \\"bashment\\", a term originating in the 1990s, was used to describe a particularly good dance; for example \\"to go to a bashment dance\\". In the Dancehall vernacular, \\"bashment\\" is therefore an adjective instead of a noun.) - Reggae en Español (in English, Spanish Reggae) is reggae and dancehall music recorded in the Spanish language by artists of Latin American origin. It originated in the mid-1970s in Panama. \\"Reggae en Español\\" goes by several names: In Panama it is called \\"La Plena\\". - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - Latin Pop Airplay (also referred to as Latin Pop Songs) is a record chart published on \\"Billboard\\" magazine. It features Latin music information from pop music usually in Spanish. It was established by the magazine on October 8, 1994 with Mañana by Cristian Castro being the first song to reach number-one. This chart features only singles or tracks and like most \\"Billboard\\" charts, is based on airplay; the radio charts are compiled using information tracked by from Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems (BDS), which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 140 markets across the United States. The audience charts cross-reference BDS data with listener information compiled by the Arbitron ratings system to determine the approximate number of audience impressions made for plays in each daypart.

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque.

First, to translate the sentence, I need to understand its meaning in English. It talks about an existing measure that will be used for two purposes: analyzing efficiency collectively and establishing user pay rates. However, this measure will also be reviewed considering some specific output. 2. Next, I implemented the translation. Here's a breakdown of how each part of the sentence was translated: - \\"The existing measure will be used\\" = \\"La mesure existante sera utilisée\\" - \\"as a collective analysis of efficiency\\" = 'comme une analyse collective de l'efficacité' - \\"and as a means of establishing user pay rates\\" = \\"et comme moyen d'établir les tarifs payants des utilisateurs\\" - \\"but will be reviewed in conjunction with specific output.\\" = \\"mais sera révisée en conjonction avec la sortie spécifique.\\" 3. In translating, I had to ensure that the sentence follows French grammatical rules. This may mean rearranging where some verbs and nouns go, compared to the English sentence. 4. The translation is not literal for every word because direct translations may not preserve meaning properly. For instance, \\"output\\" has been translated to \\"sortie\\", a common term in French for results or output. In French, a literal translation could lead to a loss of the original English meaning or end up as an awkward phrase in French. Therefore, I chose words and phrases that make sense in French and convey the same original meaning.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

Movie title: A Very Short Life Movie plot: In Hong Kong, Dennis Law, a property developer and filmmaker, attends a dinner party hosted by his attorney friend, Herman Lee. At the party, Dennis meets Cat Lam, a female police inspector who decides to tell him about a police investigation involving the murder of a young girl. The story flashes back to when Cat meets Josephine Wong, a police commissioner who wishes to re-open an investigation involving the death of a young girl at the hands of her mother. She is joined by her female colleagues: Barbara, a criminologist; and Ivy, a police sergeant. Josephine decides to conduct an interrogation with the suspect, Becky Lee. Throughout the interrogation, Becky refuses to give a statement, and as a result, becomes subject to police brutality. Josephine and her colleagues leave her naked in the cold interrogation room, and later conduct a body cavity search. Cat later tells how she became involved in the investigation. She arrives at a hospital to find the little girl, Ho Heiyi, lying unconscious and her body full of scars. She dies immediately before doctors can prepare for an operation. She later arrests Jo, Becky's boyfriend, who was caught trying to get rid of possible evidence on his computer. The police also find a series of burnt videotapes. Cat reveals that the tapes contained child pornography. During the interrogation, it is revealed that Barbara and the other officers physically restrained Becky, while forcing her to watch one of the videotapes that features Jo having sex with her daughter. After the interrogation, a flashback reveals that Heiyi received the multiple scars after being physically beaten and whipped with a belt by Becky. While in her jail cell, Becky attempts suicide by cutting her wrists on a stone bed and later gnawing on the arteries.

III. stomach chambers. IV. kidneys. Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The kidneys are responsible for removing excess H+ ions from the blood. If the kidneys fail, what would happen to blood pH and to hemoglobin affinity for oxygen? Factors That Affect Oxygen Binding The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. In addition to P O , 2 other environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery. Carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 39.20). When carbon + dioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate (HCO− 3 ) and hydrogen ions (H ). As the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, more H+ is produced and the pH decreases. This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the pH was higher. A similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. Increased temperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced. Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygencarrying capacity. In sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened, reducing its ability to deliver oxygen (Figure 39.21). In this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries. This is painful when it occurs. Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb. Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of hemoglobin. Therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity is diminished. Q: What are responsible for removing excess h+ ions from the blood? A: A:","response":"The kidneys are responsible for removing excess H+ ions from the blood."},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is an older standard, adopted starting with British railways in 1847.

Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system.

(CBS SF) SAN FRANCISCO (KCBS) — KCBS has learned that Saint Mary’s Cathedral, the principal church of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, has installed a watering system to keep the homeless from sleeping in the cathedral’s doorways. UPDATE: Archdiocese Apologizes, Will Remove Anti-Homeless Sprinkler System The cathedral, at Geary and Gough, is the home church of the Archbishop. There are four tall side doors, with sheltered alcoves, that attract homeless people at night. “They actually have signs in there that say, ‘No Trespassing,’” said a homeless man named Robert. But there are no signs warning the homeless about what happens in these doorways, at various times, all through the night. Water pours from a hole in the ceiling, about 30 feet above, drenching the alcove and anyone in it. The shower ran for about 75 seconds, every 30 to 60 minutes while we were there, starting before sunset, simultaneously in all four doorways. KCBS witnessed it soak homeless people, and their belongings. “We’re going to be wet there all night, so hypothermia, cold, all that other stuff could set in. Keeping the church clean, but it could make people sick,” Robert said. The water doesn’t really clean the area. There are syringes, cigarette butts, soggy clothing and cardboard. There is no drainage system. The water pools on the steps and sidewalks. A neighbor who witnessed the drenching told KCBS, “I was just shocked, one because it’s inhumane to treat people that way. The second thing is that we are in this terrible drought. READ MORE: SF Spends 3 Million Cleaning Up After Homeless Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless said, “It’s very shocking, and very inhumane. There’s not really another way to describe it. Certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings.” A cathedral staff member confirmed to KCBS the system was installed, perhaps a year ago, to deter the homeless from sleeping there. Chris Lyford, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, said cathedral staff tries hard to help these people. “We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,” Lyford said. “To Saint Anthony’s soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes.” But he says they keep coming back, and most seem to have serious substance abuse issues. “We do the best we can, and supporting the dignity of each person. But there is only so much you can do.” Some of the homeless bring waterproof gear, even an umbrella, to try to stay dry. Frustrated cathedral employees tell us they don’t have the staff to police the doorways, which are used by churchgoers during services. Lyford, who says he didn’t know about the water system until we showed it to him, admits it doesn’t seem to be an effective deterrent. READ RELATED: Catholic Students Blast Morality Code For Teachers Then, suggests this church neighbor, turn it off. “I would hope that they would stop doing this, both for environmental reasons and for common decency.” KCBS has also learned from a review of city permit records that the system was installed illegally, and may violate water use regulations. RELATED: What To Do If You’re Concerned About A Homeless Person Sleeping In Your Doorway The Archdiocese issued a new statement Wednesday morning about the story, saying the church will address the situation at the Cathedral immediately and will have further comment later in the day.

Throughout history, societies have been continuously evolving, marked by significant changes in technology, culture, and lifestyles. As these alterations occur, people might feel a shift in values and expectations, leading to the assumption that time often influences the way they perceive various aspects of life. However, it is essential to recognize that there is a consistent emphasis on tradition and spirituality in people's lives, regardless of the passage of time. Traditions comprise beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation. They serve as a connection to a community's cultural heritage, ensuring the continuity of shared experiences and fostering a sense of identity. Spirituality, on the other hand, relates to an individual's search for meaning, purpose, and connection. It transcends religious and cultural boundaries and can provide a profound sense of peace and contentment. In times of uncertainty, people often turn to spirituality for comfort, solace, and guidance. As the world continues to change, it is crucial to acknowledge the unwavering role that traditions and spirituality play in sustaining societies and shaping individual values. Despite rapid advancements and shifting priorities, the significance of these cultural elements remains a constant in people's lives.

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

This distinction divides life forms into two fundamental groups, and is key to proper classification. Step 2: Determine its mode of nutrition Understanding how the organism feeds – whether it produces its own food, absorbs nutrients from the environment, or ingests other organisms – further narrows down its classification. Step 3: Analyze its reproductive methods While several species across kingdoms can share some reproductive methods, assessing this aspect can still help distinguish between certain groups, particularly when used in conjunction with other factors. Step 4: Consider additional characteristics Other factors like habitat or appearance may support the chosen classification, but should not be the primary criteria due to variations within kingdoms.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The scenario presented involves pumping carbon dioxide into a room where plants are kept and its potential impact on the fossilization process, particularly the step where bones are pushed further down into the ground. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, we must first understand the roles that both carbon dioxide and plants play in this context. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that is vital for life on Earth. It is an essential component of the process of photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis is the way plants produce their food by converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbohydrates, or glucose. The presence of more carbon dioxide can promote faster plant growth since it's one of the raw materials required for photosynthesis. Now, let's analyze the potential impact of increased carbon dioxide levels on the fossilization process. The process, as described in the question, involves several key steps like the decomposition of soft tissues, exposure of bones to scavengers and environmental factors, and eventual burial of bones and their subsequent mineralization. In this context, increased carbon dioxide levels stimulating faster plant growth might have indirect effects on some of these steps. For instance, if there is a significant increase in the growth of plants, vegetation coverage may increase in the area surrounding the decomposing organism. This could potentially speed up the decomposition process as it creates a more suitable environment for detritivores and decomposers. However, the primary focus of the question is how it might affect the bones being pushed further into the ground. In this case, the effect of increased CO2 levels on plant growth might be indirect. If the increased plant growth leads to denser vegetation and more organic matter accumulation, it could contribute to increased soil formation over time. This increased rate of soil accumulation might, to some extent, cause bones to be buried more quickly. Additionally, extensive root systems from the growing plants might help in stabilizing the soil, preventing some scattering of bones by wind and rain. With this understanding, the supposed perturbation in this scenario can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. The increased CO2 levels would promote plant growth, and in turn, this growth might influence some aspects of bone burial and fossilization, though not directly impacting the primary drivers of these processes."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians gathered in Gaza in a show of support for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah Party on Friday, the 48th anniversary of the party's founding. Palestine Liberation Organization leaders say Fatah was officially founded in 1965 which coincided with its first major attack against Israel. It was an unusual scene in Gaza because it was the first mass rally showing open support for Fatah since 2007. That is the year Hamas seized control of Gaza from Fatah, which now controls only the West Bank. The number of people who showed up surprised many. Some participants slept in the Gaza City square after gathering there overnight and the crowds eventually grew so large by daytime that at least seven of the major streets around the rally were filled with people. High-level","response":"representatives from both Fatah and Hamas attended the event, demonstrating a potential shift towards reconciliation and unity between the two rival factions, which had been bitterly divided for over a decade. The rally's unprecedented scale and the warm reception that Fatah's members received from the people of Gaza indicated a strong desire for healing and reconciliation at a grassroots level, as well as a renewed sense of Palestinian nationalism transcending internal factional disputes. Prominent leaders from both factions delivered passionate speeches highlighting the importance of a united Palestinian front in pursuing a just resolution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict and securing self-determination for the Palestinian people. Throughout the rally, both Fatah and Hamas supporters waved the Palestinian flag, emphasizing their shared identity and aspirations for an independent Palestinian state. The speeches reiterated each faction's commitment to resistance against Israeli occupation and their determination to achieve the long-awaited establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. While acknowledging their past differences, speakers also stressed the need for intra-Palestinian unity to effectively confront Israeli policies, especially in light of recent regional developments such as the Abraham Accords, which left many Palestinians feeling increasingly isolated and marginalized. Notably, the rally marked a noteworthy departure from the tense atmosphere that had characterized relations between Fatah and Hamas since 2007. After Hamas' takeover of Gaza, violent clashes between the factions had left hundreds of Palestinians dead and their society more fractured than ever. Attempts to broker a reconciliation between the factions, including various agreements mediated by external powers like Egypt, had yielded little success over the years. The atmosphere at the 48th-anniversary event, however, suggested that significant changes were finally afoot. Despite the positive atmosphere at the rally, challenges to reconciliation remain. For instance, there remain deep ideological differences between the two factions, with Fatah historically adopting a more secular and nationalist stance compared to Hamas' more conservative, Islamist orientation. Additionally, the two parties maintain contrasting approaches to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the peace process, with Fatah subscribing to the two-state solution while Hamas maintains a more confrontational posture towards Israel. Moreover, the international community perceives the factions differently; Fatah is internationally recognized as the legitimate Palestinian representative, whereas many states and organizations consider Hamas a terrorist organization. This disparity could complicate potential political arrangements between the factions and hinder their ability to work together on the world stage. Despite these obstacles, the momentum generated by the 48th-anniversary rally in Gaza could pave the way for a genuine thaw between Fatah and Hamas. If both factions capitalize on this moment, work through their differences, and negotiate a power-sharing agreement, they may finally be effective in presenting a united front against Israeli occupation and challenging unilateral measures detrimental to the Palestinian cause. Though forging such unity will not be an easy task, the overwhelming public display of support seen at the rally could serve as a catalyst for significant progress on this front, contingent upon the sincerity and willingness of Fatah and Hamas to set aside their differences for the greater benefit of the Palestinian people."},{"question":"This is some data: Ayam penyet, region, Singapore; Ayam penyet, ingredient, Fried chicken; Ayam penyet, mainIngredient, \\"Squeezed\\" or \\"smashed\\" fried chicken served with sambal; Ayam penyet, servingTemperature, \\"Hot\\"; Ayam penyet, country, Indonesia.

Ruth Etting (November 23, 1897 - September 24, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage, radio, and film. Known as \\"America's sweetheart of song\\", her signature tunes were \\"Shine On, Harvest Moon\\", \\"Ten Cents a Dance\\" and \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\". Her other popular recordings included \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\", \\"Mean to Me\\", \\"Exactly Like You\\" and \\"Shaking the Blues Away\\". As a young girl in Nebraska, Etting had wanted to be an artist; she drew and sketched everywhere she was able. Etting fell in love with her pianist, Myrl Alderman, who was separated from his wife. In January 1938, she began receiving threatening telephone calls from Snyder, who initially claimed Etting withheld assets from him when the divorce settlement was made. Though the couple was divorced, Snyder was also upset because of reports that she was seeing another man. Snyder told Etting that he would come to California and kill her. When Snyder telephoned and found Etting unavailable, he told his daughter Edith that he \\"would fix her ticket, too\\". He called again that evening; this time Etting took the call with her cousin, Arthur Etting, listening on an extension. Etting requested police protection after the telephone call and arranged for private protection. Apparently believing the danger was over when Snyder did not appear soon after his telephone call, Etting released her bodyguards a few days later. On October 15, 1938, Snyder detained Myrl Alderman at a local radio station and forced the pianist to take him to his former wife at gunpoint. In the house at the time were Etting and Edith Snyder. Edith, Snyder's daughter by a previous marriage, worked for Etting and remained living with her after the divorce. Snyder held Etting and Alderman at gunpoint; when told his daughter was in another part of the house, he made Etting call her into the room. Snyder said he intended to kill all three, and told them to be quiet. When Myrl Alderman attempted to speak, Snyder shot him. Snyder then told his ex-wife, \\"I've had my revenge, so you can call the police.\\" Snyder claimed Myrl Alderman pulled a gun and shot at him first and that his ex-wife would not file charges against him because she still loved him. He also claimed he was drunk when he made the telephone threats to Etting in January 1938, saying that at the time his intentions were to kill both his ex-wife and himself. Ruth Etting said that the only gun in the home belonged to her, and after the shooting of Alderman, she was able to go into her bedroom and get it. Upon seeing Etting's gun, Moe Snyder wrested it away from her; it landed on the floor. Snyder's daughter, Edith, picked it up and held it on her father, shooting at him but hitting the floor instead. During a police reenactment of the shooting three days later, Edith Snyder said that she fired at her father to save Ruth Etting, weeping as she continued, \\"I don't yet know whether I am sorry I missed my Dad or whether I am glad\\". Snyder was accused of attempting to murder his ex-wife, his daughter, and Etting's accompanist, Myrl Alderman, the kidnapping of Alderman, as well as California state gun law violations.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Well, we have new information tonight on a series of terrifying raids that were reportedly part of a political retribution deal against supporters of Governor Scott Walker. The raids just coming to light after a couple of folks came forward and spoke to National Review writer David French, including this woman, Cindy Archer. Archer says she was asleep in her home one night when she was jolted awake when more than a dozen police officers with a battering ram were yelling and pounding on the door. She says she was trying desperately to calm down her dogs, begging the police not to shoot them. She was afraid, given how angry they appeared. She says police would not say why they were there, but they ransacked her home, grabbed computers and phones and told Ms. Archer she could not tell anyone. And there was much more to this story. Michael Lutz is a decorated retired police officer who many say confirmed these raids were politically motivated, and head of Wisconsin Club for Growth, Eric O'Keefe says the raid victims are guilty of nothing more than exercising their right to support conservative causes. All right. Thank you both so much for being here. So, let me start with you on this, Eric. So, you are affiliated with this conservative group, and you know some of the people who were targeted in these raids. What were -- the police were there on a prosecutor's push and a judge's order, because they were suspected of pushing conservative issues, basically. That's the charge. Just like in the IRS deal, they were being targeted for supporting conservative issues. ERIC O'KEEFE, WISCONSIN CLUB FOR GROWTH: Right. They were being targeted based on a theory which is completely unsupportable under Wisconsin law. But apart from even that, the reality is, as I told my colleagues as soon as I was able to speak to them, you were attacked for your virtue, for your effectiveness, that's why they were attacked. Because the left was tired of losing election after election after election. They correctly identified some of the most important communicators of political messages in Wisconsin and raided their family homes with kids at home. They knew the kids were at home. They knew the schedules. They came in the dark and put aside whether people should have filed different campaign financial reports. Is this an appropriate tactic for any kind of campaign finance question? They already had our e-mails, we subsequently learned. They already had our bank records. They knew what we were doing. We were proud of what we were doing. They didn't ask us. These raids were not really based on any belief that they would find incriminating information. KELLY: And the person at the heart of it is the prosecutor, John Chisolm, and Mike, that's somebody you know well. And this is a man who was married to a union steward who didn't like Scott Walker, who didn't like his policies and certainly didn't like the conservative efforts in Wisconsin. MICHAEL LUTZ, RETIRED MILWAUKEE POLICE OFFICER: That's correct, Megyn. KELLY: And so how were you privy to that information? I mean, what evidence, if any, do you have that it was politically motivated, them going after these conservatives? LUTZ: Sure, I was in a unique position to have some personal conversations with John Chisolm during my time as a police officer. I was working intimately with John on gun crime issues, when I retired from the police department after getting shot, John was a mentor of mine. Good friend of mine. He talked me into going to law school. KELLY: So did he tell you this stuff? I mean, did he admit that he was doing it for political reasons? LUTZ: He did. In a personal conversation in his office, he had stated that he believed it was his personal responsibility to stop Governor Walker and all Republicans from continuing on with Act 10 and supporting Act 10 and Governor Walker. KELLY: Eric, do you -- are you under a secrecy order right now? Because everybody has been told not to speak. O'KEEFE: Yes. An unconstitutional secrecy order. And I'm defying the secrecy order. KELLY: Are you fearful given the tactics we've seen? O'KEEFE: No, I'm not. I would ask them if they want to arrest me to give a phone call and I'll turn myself in. KELLY: You -- the raid victims in this case -- the raid targets in this case were harassed in the middle of the night in front of their children, often in front of their neighbors. Some in the morning when school buses were going by, and little children were seeing families with several police officers there and battering rams, and yet all of them were told keep your mouths shut. You're not allowed to speak of it? O'KEEFE: Right. And the -- and the children were told -- the children were detained from going to school at the appropriate time. Parent asked -- in two cases I know of, what do they tell the school. And they were told to lie, to lie about why they were late. Children's computers were seized with homework on them. And they were told to lie about it. So, you know, the old thing, the dog ate my homework. How does it sound, you know, I lost my computer. Where did you lose it? I don't know. So, there's a little bit of a... KELLY: Are these people going to be sitting there thinking -- and I realize there is this law in Wisconsin that allows supposedly -- it's being challenged -- this secrecy to go on while they're investigating this kind of case, but these people have got to be asking themselves whether this is still the United States of America. O'KEEFE: They did. They were stunned. It was stunning. It's been a stunning attack. And I have sued John Chisolm. He's not fit to serve in public office. I want him removed from office. KELLY: He denies all of this. I mean, he does not -- he says this is legit. They had a judge sign off on it, Mike. He wasn't out there alone they had the cooperation of the courts. LUTZ: But, Megyn, this is why I came forward in the first place, because through the conversations and through what I witnessed in the district attorney's office, John Chisolm had become so hyper political and hyper partisan that he had weaponized his district attorney's office to go after and prosecute and persecute all those who had a different political ideology than him. And that's why I came forward and that's why it's just so disgusting and un-American what's going on here. KELLY: We're going to stay on this. We are very grateful to the two of you for coming on tonight. And again, our offer to John Chisolm to come on and offer his side of the story remains.

Delaware State Police Sgt. Paul Shavack confirmed three people died in the shooting at the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington. He said the suspected gunmen and two women are dead. The city's mayor said earlier in the day that one of the women killed was the shooter's estranged wife, but Shavack said police had not confirmed that was the case. Wilmington Mayor Dennis Williams said in a telephone interview that he was told the man shot and killed his wife. Shavack said two police officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries. He said officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter in courthouse's lobby before he passed metal detectors. Shavack did not say whether the shooter killed the two women or whether they were killed in the gunfire. Shavack also did not say how the shooter died. Dozens of police cars and emergency vehicles were on the streets surrounding the courthouse in the hours after the shooting, and police were searching the courthouse room by room as a precaution. Jose Beltran, 53, a court employee who works in the building, was entering the lobby Monday morning when he heard two shots. He said he turned around and ran. \\"It happened so fast,\\" he said, adding he heard three or more shots as he ran. Dick Lawyer works across the street at the law office of Casarino, Christman, Shalk, Ransom & Doss and said his office building had been on lockdown since about 8:15 a.m. The shooting occurred about five minutes earlier. He said he and colleagues were shaken at first but calmer hours later. \\"We have a couple of people whose relatives work at the courthouse,\\" he said. State police scheduled another briefing at noon. ||||| WILMINGTON — Two women were shot to death when a gunman opened fire at the New Castle County Courthouse this morning, state police said. The shooter, who police said is dead, was the former father-in-law of one of the women killed, law enforcement and legal sources said. Police said the gunman entered the lobby of the courthouse about 8 a.m. and started shooting, and Capitol Police returned fire. Two injured Capitol Police officers were shot in the chest, but saved by bulletproof vests. One wounded officer was identified this evening as Steven Rinehart, 50, a retired New Castle County officer who joined the state force last year, law enforcement sources say. Police said Rinehart and another Capitol Police officer were injured in the shooting, and were later released after seeking treatment at a hospital. The other injured officer has not been identified, but police said he is a 42-year-old on the force seven years. Rinehart ran into the open lobby area of the courthouse as the shooting began and exchanged gunfire with the gunman, probably saving other people, a law enforcement person familiar with the investigation said. Rinehart retired as a senior corporal from the county police on July 14 after serving 24 years, according to a county resolution passed last month commending his service. He served in the patrol division, traffic services, motorcycle unit and Westover Hills patrol, and was a certified police instructor and active as a field training officer. Law enforcement and legal sources identified the gunman as Thomas Matusiewicz, the 68-year-old father of David T. Matusiewicz, a former optometrist who spent time in federal prison for kidnapping his three daughters and bank fraud in 2007. David Matusiewicz, 45, was involved in a bitter custody fight with his ex-wife, Christine Belford, identified by law enforcement and legal sources as one of the women killed in the shooting. The other woman killed has not been identified. It was unknown whether police killed the shooter when returning fire or if he took his own life. Police said at least one of the victims was targeted by the shooter. ||||| Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk.

Police tape surrounds the court house in Wilmington after three people were killed, including the gunman. Investigators were still on the scene Monday night, several hours after a gunman burst into the New Castle County Courthouse and shot two women and two officers. The building, which was on lockdown for several hours, will be closed Tuesday. Witnesses described a terrifying scene that unfolded just after 8 a.m. when the gunman burst into the New Castle County Courthouse lobby and shot two women and two officers before he was killed. The two women died while investigators say the bullet proof vests the two officers were wearing stopped the bullets. A law enforcement official initially named David Matusiewicz as the shooter. His name appeared on the sign-in log for a child support hearing. But now that official says that David was not the gunman. \\"At first it started off as two, and then from there it just escalated and went from two to multiple shots,'\\" juror Robert McNulty told FOX 29's Claudia Gomez. \\"All you heard was 'get down, get down, get down' and shots kept firing.\\" Another juror, Greg Simpson, described the scene as \\"terror.\\" \\"It was like, okay, this can't be happening in a courthouse. But yes, it's happening at the courthouse,\\" Simpson said. Police say the gunman entered the courthouse lobby from a side entrance, then took aim at two women standing in the lobby. The gunman, according to investigators, apparently had then fired on two officers. A gunfight ensued. The gunman died in the lobby of the courthouse. Investigators say they're not sure yet whether he took his own life or whether he was killed by the officers. Late Monday afternoon, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden made clear the shooting was not random. \\"This was not, I reiterate, not a random act of violence,\\" Beau Biden said during a 3 p.m. news conference. Biden told reporters preliminary information shows the shooting was the result of a custody dispute. \\"Preliminarily, this was the result of a custody dispute that has lasted in our court system for several years.\\" Investigators say the gunman never got past security checkpoints. Victim Identified FOX 29's Claudia Gomez and Dave Schratwieser have confirmed one of the victims has been identified as Christine Belford.

It sits atop Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants. The original building was completed in 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome, and expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as \\"fronts\\", though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries. Prior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey).

Ashley Collman. The 12-year-old girl who was mauled by a raccoon as a baby is back at home after successfully undergoing surgery to create a new ear. Charlotte Ponce of Spring Lake, Michigan was just three-months-old in 2002 when her young parents left her at home with the pet and she lost her right ear, nose and part of her lip in an attack. Two years ago, Doctor Kongrit Chaiyasate repaired little Charlotte's nose and now he's focusing on giving her a new ear. Going home: Charlotte Ponce, 12, of Spring Lake, Michigan was released from the hospital Monday after undergoing a seven-hour surgery to implant cartilage into her arm. Revolutionary surgery: The lung cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into Charlotte's arm during the April 15 surgery. Growing: The cartilage will continue to grow in her arm for the next few months before doctors will attach it to her ear. Pictured above on Monday. One last surgery: Little Charlotte will return to the hospital in June for her surgery, which will hopefully be her last. Pictured above on Monday. 'The raccoon pretty much ate the right side of her face, all the way back to the ear,' Charlotteâ€™s adoptive mom Sharon Ponce told ABCNews.com. 'Now, all she wants is to wear two earrings.' That dream of pierced ears came closer to reality on April 15, when she underwent a seven-hour surgery to embed lung cartilage, shaped into an ear lobe, into her arm where it will continue to grow until June. That's when Charlotte will go under the knife for hopefully the last time as Dr Chaiyaste attaches the cartilage to her ear. Brave: Charlotte Ponce was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose, ear and lips. Pictured above just before she underwent the surgery on April 15. But this last procedure will be the most complex yet, as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before.[. Dr Chaiyasate admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right, so he has been practicing on a potato. Dr Chaiyasate, of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, told WBIV:. 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit -. what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.' Mauled: Charlotte Ponce as a baby before and after the attack. Her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl. He said he could not guarantee success, but would try his best. Charlotte's adopted mother Sharon Ponce said people from as far as Britain and Australia had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been. She was just a newborn when her 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the pet. The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked. Her great-aunt Sharon and great-uncle Tim only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night's news bulletin. They gained custody of Charlotte and her brother Marshall, who was then 15 months old, and they and their friends raised more than 10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital. Sharon had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after Charlotte after doctors said she would need full time care. Although ears have been made out of ribs before, the method of 'growing' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare. Remarkable: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation. He said this next surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done. Attack: It has been a slow recovery for Charlotte, who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose. Intact: Charlotte as a baby with her brother Marshall before she was attacked in late 2002. Happy family: Charlotte now lives with (from left) her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall. It has to be done because Charlotte's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head. Charlotte previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable. Yet despite the enormous damage, there is one miracle. Even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life, Charlotte's hearing has been largely unaffected. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"This article is about a 12-year-old girl named Charlotte Ponce who lost her right ear, nose, and part of her lip when she was a baby due to a raccoon attack.

Charlotte had a surgery where lung cartilage shaped like an ear lobe was put into her arm, and it will keep growing there until June.

Question: suppose the dishwasher already has detergent happens, how will it affect MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"To answer this question, we first need to understand the relationship between the events mentioned: 1. The gravity of the Sun pulls its mass inward. 2. There is a lot of pressure on the Sun. 3. The pressure forces atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in nuclear reactions. 4. The energy from the reactions gives off different kinds of light. 5. The light travels to the Earth. 6. The dishwasher already has detergent. 7. MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth. Now let's analyze if there is any connection between these events: The dishwasher having detergent seems completely unrelated to the events 1 to 5 that describe the process of the Sun emitting light. It is an independent event that has no influence on the Sun's behavior or the light reaching the Earth. Now let's consider the effect of event 7 (MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth) on event 2 (There is a lot of pressure on the Sun). More sunlight reaching Earth could be due to changes in the Sun's behavior, such as an increase in solar activity or intensity of electromagnetic radiation. However, it could also be due to changes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as a reduction in air pollution or cloud coverage, which would not affect the pressure on the Sun. Given this information, we can conclude that the dishwasher having detergent has no effect on more sunlight arriving at the Earth. Moreover, the supposed perturbation has no effect on the second effect mentioned (the pressure on the Sun), as it is an independent event with no connection to the solar processes. So, regarding the influence of the supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned, the answer is: no effect."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Winters here are marvelously mild and deserted, but even during the peak summer months you can seek out the island's many enchanted corners away from the crowds.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Winter is this location's busiest peak season and it's impossible to avoid the crowds.\\"?","response":"Step 1: Identify the information given in the premise. The premise states that winters in this location are mild and deserted, and during the peak summer months, it's still possible to find the island's peaceful spots away from crowds. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that winter is the busiest peak season for the location and it is impossible to avoid the crowds. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that winters are the busiest peak season and it's impossible to avoid the crowds. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis.

As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores.

Hastings is most famous for this battle which was fought in which month of 1066?","response":"The Battle of Hastings, an event of great historical significance and an essential turning point in English history, occurred on October 14, 1066. This battle is arguably the most famous due to its far-reaching consequences that decisively shaped the future of England and Western Europe. The battle was fought between the armies of the English King Harold Godwinson and the invading Norman forces led by Duke William of Normandy, who later became known as William the Conqueror. The backdrop of this conflict can be traced to the struggles for succession following the death of Edward the Confessor, the King of England, in January 1066. Edward's passing without an heir led to a competition among various claimants to the English throne. Harold Godwinson was named as the successor and crowned king, but Duke William of Normandy, Harald Hardrada of Norway, and other regional nobles all claimed rights to the throne as well. Duke William of Normandy, being closely related to Edward the Confessor and having the Pope's blessing, launched a major invasion force from Normandy and landed on the southern coast of England. Meanwhile, King Harold had to quell a Norse invasion led by Harald Hardrada and his own renegade brother, Tostig Godwinson. The Battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066, saw the ultimate defeat of the Norse invaders and proved King Harold as a competent military leader. However, Harold's victory was short-lived. Duke William of Normandy landed on the English coast just a few days after the Battle of Stamford Bridge, forcing King Harold to march his exhausted troops southwards to defend against the Normans. As a result, Harold's army had insufficient time to recover and reinforce itself before the pivotal Battle of Hastings. The battle itself was brutal and closely contested. The English, led by King Harold, deployed a defensive shield wall formation, while the Normans, led by Duke William, relied on a mix of infantry, archers, and mounted knights. The fighting endured for an entire day, with both sides sustaining massive casualties. Accounts of the battle suggest that the English line held firmly until a feigned retreat by the Norman troops lured a portion of the English army out of position. This maneuver enabled the Normans to breach the shield wall, thus turning the tide of the battle in their favor. King Harold was killed during the engagement, and his death marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England. Duke William of Normandy ascended to the English throne as William the Conqueror, blending the Norman, English, and French ways of life, languages, and traditions, and ushering in a new era for England. The Battle of Hastings forever changed the course of English history and laid the foundation for the modern nation we know today."},{"question":"Definition: Given a scientific question, generate a correct answer to it.

The band came to public attention with their performance of \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" at Woodstock in 1969. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by Abraxas and Santana III. Lineup changes were common. The follow-up to Supernatural came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, Shaman was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, \\"The Game of Love\\", which featured vocals from Michelle Branch, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, \\"Why Don't You & I\\", featuring the vocals of Alex Band, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound. With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's All That I Am. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of Shaman, achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's Guitar Heaven. Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status. In 2012 the group released Shape Shifter, which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. It debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200. How many copies did Shaman sell in total?","response":"Shaman's total sales aren't explicitly mentioned in the article. However, it does mention that the album initially sold 298,973 copies in the US in its first week and eventually went on to sell 2x platinum in the US and achieved platinum status in several other countries, including Australia."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

He faced the criticism head-on and apologized in a Fox News Sunday web video: Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com Give the man some credit. Wallace didn’t offer a “sorry if you were offended by my genius” non-apology apology. He deduced — rightly — that having the question overshadow the answer in an interview is usually a mistake, and accepted it as such. Wallace is right that Bachmann’s perceived seriousness is a legitimate topic for an interview, considering her status as a presidential candidate, but at the very least Wallace should have provided better contextual basis for his question. Had he said, “So-and-so called you a flake,” or better yet, “So-and-so questioned your seriousness in light of these gaffes,” he would have opened the same topic but in a better and more fair manner for Bachmann to respond. As Wallace says, every day is a learning experience. More than a few people in his position would be tempted to dig in and defend a poor choice. Kudos to Wallace for learning a lesson and admitting to it. Still, when will the national media start questioning Obama’s seriousness if rhetorical gaffes are the determining factor, as they apparently are for Republicans such as Bachmann, Sarah Palin, and George W.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, it means that they are not in their proper place or are dirty. The most appropriate action to take in this situation is to wash them. Here's the reasoning for each option: - Gain weight: This option is not related to the situation at hand. Gaining weight is a bodily result of an individual's diet and exercise habits, and it's unrelated to the dishes in the kitchen. - Wait patiently: While this could be a choice if someone else was responsible for washing the dishes, it doesn't actively address the issue of the dishes being astray. It's more of a passive approach and doesn't provide a solution. - Stand erect: This option is unrelated to the issue of dishes in the kitchen. Standing erect refers to a person's posture, which is not connected to washing dishes or organizing them. - Promise to do: This choice is vague and doesn't specifically state what action will be taken. Promises can be broken, and this option doesn't assure that the dishes will actually be dealt with. - Washing dishes: This is the correct option. When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, it's important to clean and put them away in their proper place. Washing the dishes addresses the issue promptly and contributes to maintaining a clean and organized kitchen.

Let's break it down and analyze the premise and hypothesis in detail. Premise: The premise states that there is a man in a colorful outfit with cherries imprinted on the sleeve, pulling a cart with bags. Here, the critical pieces of information are: 1. The man has a colorful outfit. 2. The outfit has cherries imprinted on the sleeve. 3. The man is pulling a cart with bags. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that the man with the cart is wearing a shirt with a cherry design. To determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we need to evaluate if the information provided in the premise supports the hypothesis. Let's examine the hypothesis in light of the information given in the premise: 1. The man has a colorful outfit - This point does not directly address the cherry design but indicates that the man's outfit is visually striking. It does not, however, conflict with the hypothesis either. 2. The outfit has cherries imprinted on the sleeve - This detail directly addresses the cherry design mentioned in the hypothesis. Since the cherries are imprinted on the sleeve, it is reasonable to assert that the shirt has a cherry design. 3. The man is pulling a cart with bags - This piece of information does not relate to the cherry design but contributes to the overall setup of the scenario. In conclusion, as the premise states that there are cherries imprinted on the sleeve of the man's outfit, and the hypothesis concerns the man wearing a shirt with a cherry design, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The information about the colorful outfit and the cart with bags only adds context to the situation, and these details do not conflict with the hypothesis.

Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects.

Let me save you some time: There is nothing in there that will inform your opinion of Mitt Romney. How do I know? Because I saw many of the exact same documents months ago, after requesting them from a Bain Capital investor. What I quickly learned was that there was little of interest, except perhaps for private equity geeks who want to know exactly how much Bain paid for a particular company back in 2006. Sure I would have loved the pageviews, but not at the expense of tricking readers into clicking on something of so little value. Let's go over what Gawker believes it found: \\"Mitt Romney's 250 million fortune is largely a black hole: Aside from the meager and vague disclosures he has filed under federal and Massachusetts laws, and the two years of partial tax returns (one filed and another provisional) he has released, there is almost no data on precisely what his vast holdings consist of, or what vehicles he has used to escape taxes on his income.\\" There actually is plenty of data on Romney's Bain-related holdings. For example, Bain's own website lists most of its active private equity portfolio companies. Then there are third-party databases operated by such organizations as Dow Jones, Thomson Reuters and CapitalIQ -- each one of which includes searchable lists of past Bain Capital deals (often with detailed financial information). And, finally, Bain isn't really in the business of doing tiny purchases of unknown family businesses. When it buys something, there is almost always a press release and/or media coverage. Perhaps Gawker hasn't yet discovered the magic of Lexis-Nexis. Maybe it should sign up for the daily Term Sheet email. \\"Today, we are publishing more than 950 pages of internal audits, financial statements, and private investor letters for 21 cryptically named entities in which Romney had invested... Many of them are offshore funds based in the Cayman Islands.\\" I get it. \\"Cayman Islands\\" is supposed to be code for tax avoidance or shady dealings. But the reality is that most private equity firms form Cayman-domiciled funds to accommodate investors based outside of the United States (particularly when those funds also are making some non-U.S. investments). One private equity fund formation attorney I spoke with says that the Caymans structure usually doesn't have real tax benefit for the non-U.S. investors, but that they nonetheless feel more comfortable. He added that, for most U.S. private equity executives, the Cayman structure has little to zero impact in terms of personal taxes. MORE: Private equity's twisted trip down the campaign trail \\"They also show that some of the investments that Romney has always described as part of his retirement package at Bain weren't made until years after he left the company.\\" Yes, because his retirement package provided Romney with ownership positions in Bain funds raised for 10 years after he left the firm (plus the ability to co-invest his own money). This isn't breaking news (mentioned here, for example). \\"Bain isn't a company so much as an intricate suite of steadily proliferating inter-related holding companies and limited partnerships.\\" Right, it's a private equity firm. No one ever said it was \\"a company.\\" \\"When it came to the Bain investments, he simply listed the value of his investments in odd-sounding entities like 'Sankaty High Yield Partners II LP' with no indication of what was inside.\\" Odd-sounding? Maybe for those outside of New England (Sankaty is a Nantucket lighthouse), but it's also no big secret. For example, here's the Sankaty website that describes itself as a Bain Capital affiliate that \\"invests in a wide variety of securities and investments, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, distressed/stressed debt, mezzanine debt, structured products and equities.\\" From that, you might guess that Sankaty High Yield Partners III is the high-yield bond part of its business. Finally, many of Gawker's documents are for year-end 2009 (most of mine were for year-end 2008). As such, we can't even compare them to Romney's tax returns, since the GOP nominee still stubbornly refuses to release them.

Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

In 1976 he headed Team B, a team of analysts organized by the Central Intelligence Agency who analyzed the strategic capacities and goals of the Soviet military and political leadership. Pipes is the father of American historian and expert on American foreign policy and the Middle East, Daniel Pipes. Pipes was born to a Jewish family in Cieszyn, Poland, which fled the country as refugees after it was invaded by Nazi Germany. Pipes was head of the 1976 Team B, composed of civilian experts and retired military officers and agreed to by then-CIA director George H. W. Bush at the urging of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) as a competitive analysis exercise. Team B was created at the instigation of then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as an antagonist force to a group of CIA intelligence officials known as Team A. His hope was that it would produce a much more aggressive assessment of Soviet Union military capabilities. Unsurprisingly, it argued that the National Intelligence Estimate on the Soviet Union, generated yearly by the CIA, underestimated both Soviet military strategy and ambition and misinterpreted Soviet strategic intentions. Team B faced criticism. The international relations journalist Fred Kaplan writes that Team B \\"turns out to have been wrong on nearly every point.\\" Pipes's group insisted that the Soviet Union, as of 1976, maintained \\"a large and expanding Gross National Product,\\" and argued that the CIA belief that economic chaos hindered the USSR's defenses was a ruse on the part of the USSR. One CIA employee called Team B \\"a kangaroo court\\". Pipes called Team B's evidence \\"soft.\\" Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed several new weapons, featuring a nuclear-armed submarine fleet that used a system that did not depend on active sonar, and was thus undetectable by existing technology. According to Pipes, \\"Team B was appointed to look at the evidence and to see if we could conclude that the actual Soviet strategy is different from ours, i.e. the strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). It has now been demonstrated totally that it was\\". In 1986, Pipes maintained that Team B contributed to creating more realistic defense estimates. Ask a question about this article.","response":"Richard Edgar Pipes was a smart person who studied Russian history, especially about a big, powerful country called the Soviet Union. He didn't like communism, which was the way the Soviet Union was run. In 1976, he was the leader of a group called Team B. They helped the United States understand what the Soviet Union's military and leaders were thinking and doing. Team B was supposed to be a little tough on the CIA's Team A to make sure they had all the right information. Some people didn't like Team B because they thought they were wrong about some things, like how the Soviet Union was making more weapons and stuff. But Richard Pipes believed that Team B helped the United States have a better understanding of the Soviet Union's military plans."},{"question":"If \\"A speed biker makes a sharp turn on his bicycle.\\", does this mean that \\"A speed biker is walking along side his bike.\\"?","response":"No, these two statements are distinct and describe different actions carried out by the speed biker. Let's analyze each statement separately and then compare them to better understand the differences. Statement 1: \\"A speed biker makes a sharp turn on his bicycle.\\" This statement implies that the speed biker is actively riding the bicycle and steering it to make a sudden, sharp, and precise turn. Such a turn would typically involve skillful maneuvering and control of the bike while maintaining balance and speed. The emphasis here is on the riding aspect and the biker's ability to make a swift and precise turn. Statement 2: \\"A speed biker is walking along side his bike.\\" This statement presents a different scenario, where the speed biker is not actually riding the bicycle but rather walking beside it. The biker may have dismounted the bike for several reasons, such as to rest, navigate through a crowded area, or to approach an obstacle that cannot be crossed while riding. In this case, the focus is on the biker's actions performed alongside the bicycle, rather than actively riding and controlling it. To summarize, the first statement describes a situation in which the speed biker is riding and maneuvering the bicycle, while the second statement indicates that the biker is walking beside the bike. The two statements describe distinct actions, and one does not imply the other."},{"question":"How is \\"Since then the one feature that can be pointed to is that there has not been any indecision on the part of the Commission or on the part of those who are involved in trying to resolve this difficult issue.\\" said in German?","response":"Seitdem kann man sagen, dass es keine Unsicherheit von der Kommission oder von den Leuten, die versuchen, dieses schwierige Problem zu lösen, gab.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Do you have any questions?","response":"The Glory of Melaka showcases an early example of thriving international trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange in the Southeast Asian region. It demonstrates Melaka's transformation from an unimportant swampy area to a significant strategic port, attracting various powers, such as the Chinese and the Muslim trading fraternity. Melaka's transformation was due to its strategic location and deep-water harbor that easily facilitated the trade routes across the Indian Ocean. The Chinese, under Emperor Chu Ti, were the first to recognize Melaka's commercial potential and establish a presence there. With Admiral Cheng Ho leading the Chinese fleet, they struck an agreement with Parameswara, the local ruler, that included port facilities, financial tribute, and Chinese protection against the Thais. Years later, the Muslim trading fraternity gained influence in the region due to dynastic alliances and peaceful preaching of their faith. Bengali peddlers brought Islam to the east coast, and it eventually became the state religion in Melaka under Muzaffar Shah, between 1446 and 1459. Meanwhile, Sufi mystics incorporated local Malay traditions into Islamic teachings, providing a strong, male-dominated religion that promoted leadership, brotherhood, and self-reliance. Tun Perak, the bendahara and military commander of Melaka, played a significant role in expanding the sultanate's power along the west coast, as well as in nearby territories such as Singapore and the Bintan islands. He effectively utilized orang laut pirates to control the seas and extract tribute from passing ships. Tun Perak's leadership and military prowess resulted in a famous victory against a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. It is evident that Melaka's remarkable transformation relied on carefully crafted alliances, trade, and cultural exchange that influenced the region for centuries to come. Today, this historical legacy shapes Malaysia's multi-cultural and multi-religious identity, drawing from its diverse history as a significant port city and the stage for geopolitical developments in the region.

However , many tourists do not visit the suspension bridge and only hike . 2. However , many of the tourists do not visit and only hike the suspension bridge . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they actually have different implications and are not direct paraphrases of each other. Let's break down each sentence to better understand their meanings: 1. \\"However, many tourists do not visit the suspension bridge and only hike.\\" In this sentence, the implication is that there are tourists who choose not to visit the suspension bridge, and their primary activity is hiking. The term \\"only hike\\" suggests that rather than visiting the bridge, they focus on hiking as their main activity. It does not explicitly state that they are hiking around or near the bridge or have any physical interaction with the suspension bridge. The tourists' decision not to visit the bridge is emphasized. 2. \\"However, many of the tourists do not visit and only hike the suspension bridge.\\" This sentence is different because it implies that there are tourists who engage in the activity of hiking the suspension bridge without visiting it in a more leisurely or observational manner. In other words, they do not simply go to view or appreciate the bridge, but instead opt to hike across, around, or near it. The focus is on the act of hiking the suspension bridge rather than just admiring it or walking across it casually.

Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven.

The first character was a sapient horse with magical powers who was once a centaur in ancient Greece. The second character is a shapeshifter with three forms (male, female, and winged centaur). Both characters are connected to the Superman family of titles. Context: A very different Comet was introduced in Supergirl #14 (October 1997). This version was originally introduced as a hero with flight and cold-generation powers. Comet's appearance was unclear, as when using his powers he was surrounded by an aura of cold that made him resemble an actual comet. Comet looked like a man with three fingers, horse-like legs, long white hair, and a star mark on his forehead. There was a lot of speculation about who Comet was, but it was revealed that Comet was Andrea Martinez, a gay stand-up comic, who like her friend Linda Danvers (who could turn into Supergirl), could shape-shift between her human and super-powered forms (however, Comet's change also involved changing gender, from the female Andrea to the male Comet). Soon, it was learned that Comet's male form was originally Andrew Jones, a (male) jockey, who had been trampled by horses and \\"rebuilt\\" by an organization called \\"The Stable\\" as a superhuman with equine DNA. He rebelled against the organization and began operating as a superhero. On one of his first missions he attempted to save a despairing Andrea Martinez (who had just come out to her parents, and been rejected) from an avalanche, but they both died. As with Matrix and Linda Danvers (who had merged into Supergirl, the Angel of Fire), this caused them to combine into one being: the Earth Angel of Love. Comet originally was in love with Supergirl, and since he was the Angel of Love, made her have feelings for him too, but she rejected him when she learned he was also a woman. This opened the door for the third Angel, Blithe, the Angel of Light, to use her powers to exploit Comet's heartbreak, and turn them against Supergirl. She enabled Comet to fully embrace their angel powers, transforming him/herself into a winged centaur. Blithe deceived Comet into joining forces with the Carnivore (a powerful demonic creature who despised the Earth Angels, and sought their power). The Carnivore lost control, however, when Andrea abandoned her anger, learning that her mother had died, and had left a video apology for her actions. The three Earth Angels worked together to stop the Carnivore. Comet began a relationship with Blithe, since she loved both their forms (revealing that Blithe is bisexual). Question: Who is Comet Post-Crisis? Answer:","response":"Post-Crisis, Comet is a character introduced in Supergirl #14 (October 1997). Originally known as Andrea Martinez, a gay stand-up comic, Comet has the ability to shape-shift between her human form and a male super-powered form with flight and cold-generation powers. Andrea Martinez's male form, Comet, was originally Andrew Jones, a jockey who had been \\"rebuilt\\" with equine DNA by an organization called \\"The Stable.\\" The two individuals merged into one being, the Earth Angel of Love, during a tragic event when they both died and later became connected to the Superman family of titles. Comet initially falls in love with Supergirl, but after facing rejection due to his dual identity, he starts a relationship with Blithe, the Angel of Light, who is revealed to be bisexual."},{"question":"Title: Nothings Perfect Review: I have had the LM900 model for over a month now, and I must say I am pretty content with it. It took some acclimating for my two cats, but after they started using it it became ordinary for them. The only flaw I have found with the model is that it sometimes misses the smaller clumps, namely the fragments of bigger clumps that break up while its cleaning. However, this might only be a symptom of the litter I am currently using, Arm & Hammer. So, in order to get the box completely clean, you will need to use the included scooper to sift out the smaller pieces and clean the blades of the automatic arm (some clumps get stuck between the blades). So you will still have to do some work, but compared to a normal litter box you are saving a lot of time and effort. I would definitely recommend this product. Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","response":"The review is overall positive. Although the reviewer points out a minor flaw with the LM900 model and the need for occasional manual intervention to clean smaller clumps and the automatic arm's blades, they emphasize their overall contentment and satisfaction with the product.

To answer this question, let's break down the different parts of the equation: 1. (2^(47/46))/47: This part of the equation represents dividing the 47th root of 2 by 47. Essentially, divide 2 by 47, and then take the 46th root. 2. A^(1/47): This part of the equation indicates raising the variable A to the 47th power. 3. Finally, we are given that the result of both these operations is equal to 2. With this information, let's solve for A: (2^(47/46))/47 = A^(1/47) To isolate A, we simply raise both sides of the equation to the power of 47: ((2^(47/46))/47)^47 = A Now we can calculate the value of A: ((2^(1.0217391304347826))/47)^47 ≈ 2.005372045694741 So, A is approximately equal to 2.005372045694741."},{"question":"With 27 games to play, the Braves went 9-18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89-73. The Cardinals, meanwhile, went 18-8 to finish at 90-72. Braves closer Craig Kimbrel, who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves. After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man Jonny Venters posted a 5.11 September ERA. These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager Fredi González. Veteran starter Derek Lowe posted a win-loss record of 0-5 in September with an ERA of 8.75. Shortly into the offseason, Lowe would be traded to the Cleveland Indians. The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games. Over the last five games, all of which were losses for the Braves, the team managed to score only seven runs.

In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When considering an individual's transportation method in an urban area, it is essential to weigh multiple factors like environmental impact, cost-efficiency, convenience, and the safety of avoiding potentially crowded situations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. (A) Walking is undoubtedly the most environmentally friendly and cost-efficient means of transportation. However, it may not be the most convenient method for covering long distances, and it doesn't always provide an option to avoid crowded areas. (B) Public transportation, such as buses and subways, are both cost-efficient and convenient for covering longer distances. Nonetheless, they can overcrowd, increasing the risk of being exposed to the virus and potentially contradicting social distancing guidelines and compromising safety. (C) Driving a car is rather convenient since it enables users to cover long distances and have better control over their surroundings. However, cars emit greenhouse gases, contributing negatively to the environment. Furthermore, the cost of fuel, parking, and car maintenance might make it less cost-efficient than other methods. (D) Bicycling (or e-bikes) can be a suitable option for mitigating environmental impact as it produces zero emissions. Bicycles are cost-efficient since they require minimal maintenance and don't incur fuel costs. They also present the convenience of covering longer distances faster than walking, and users can maneuver through various paths, allowing for the avoidance of crowded situations during the pandemic.

Kevin knows how to dance","response":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"Kevin knows how to dance,\\" can logically follow the preceding text. Although Kevin experiences rejection in the story, there are contextual clues that suggest he knows how to dance. Firstly, Kevin is at a club, which is a social setting where people often engage in dancing, indicating that he has some experience with or interest in this activity. Additionally, the text mentions that he is \\"having a great time,\\" which implies that he feels comfortable and is enjoying himself while dancing at the club, possibly because he is skilled at it or enjoys the act of dancing. Furthermore, Kevin tries to dance with a pretty woman, showing that he has enough confidence in his dancing abilities to approach others. Of course, the woman's refusal does not automatically suggest that his dancing skills are inadequate.

The coupon got us to try Casavino, but we definitely won't be back. The \\"staff\\" - Jeff (?) & Josh (the J2 on the labels) - were unprofessional and unknowledgeable about the wines that they serve. They informed us half way through our tasting that there were no snacks available on Sundays because the restaurant in the same strip mall where they get their food is closed on Sundays . . . shouldn't this have either (a) been told to us when we made our reservation, or (b) perhaps they could have made other arrangements to serve their patrons on Sundays?

One of the only interesting wines that we tried was their white port, which, of course, wasn't included in the coupon. As part of the deal, they took our picture and put it on a wine bottle label - they might want to invest in a new printer, as the photo and label are so washed out, you can barely make out our faces.

Like All in the Family, Maude was a sitcom with topical storylines created by producer Norman Lear. Can we conclude that was maude a spin off of all in the family?","response":"Yes, it can be concluded that Maude was indeed a spin-off from the television show All in the Family. This conclusion can be drawn based on the details provided. First, let's understand the terms. A spin-off in the context of television is a program featuring a character or characters that originally appeared in a different series. There are two primary ways a spin-off can be made: one is when a character from the original show leaves and appears in a completely different setting and usually in their own new storyline. The second is when a group of characters in the show are taken and a new show is created, focusing on this group. Let's refer back to the information on Maude. The show was billed as the first spin-off of All in the Family - this statement explicitly suggests that Maude is a product of All in the Family and hence qualifies it as a spin-off. Beatrice Arthur who played the character Maude, is stated to have made two appearances on All in the Family before the inception of Maude. She is described as Edith Bunker's cousin, which signifies her role's linkage to the original series. This character continuity is typical of many spin-offs and supports the assertion that Maude was a spin-off. Additionally, it’s notable that both shows were created by Norman Lear, further solidifying the connection between them. Often, spin-offs are initiated by the same creative team that helmed the original series, lending thematic and stylistic coherence between the two productions. Furthermore, noting that Maude, like All in the Family, was a sitcom with topical storylines suggests a narrative continuation of the style and structure applied in All in the Family. So, considering all these points, the assertion that Maude is a spin-off of All in the Family is supported by substantial evidence based on the historical context, character continuity, creator commonality, and similarity in genre and thematic elements."},{"question":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910? ? The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times.

But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all its accompanying difficulties, soon follows. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne's closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. The answer is:","response":"The full real name of the person that has hair loss in the article is Annie Parker. The hair loss is a result of the surgery and chemotherapy treatments she receives for her breast cancer diagnosis.

Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'position held' with 'grand ayatollah'. The answer to this question is:","response":"Sayyid Ruhollah Msavi Khomeini, known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, held the position of grand ayatollah. He was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader, revolutionary, and politician. Khomeini was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Following the revolution, Khomeini took on the position of the country's Supreme Leader - a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation. He held this position until his death and was succeeded by Ali Khamenei. A \\"grand ayatollah\\", usually comes with influence and prestige in Shia Islam. It's a high-ranking title given to Usuli Twelver Shah clerics that have display mastery in Islamic studies such as jurisprudence, quran reading, and philosophy and usually teach in Islamic seminaries. Essentially, a grand ayatollah is a prominent Marja, or source of emulation - a title given to the highest level in the Usuli Twelver Shia clergy. The decisions of a grand ayatollah are considered binding and to carry legal authority, as he receives the following of many other Shia Muslims. Posthisiously, Khomeini's reigious influence and authority extended beyond Iran's borders, reaching a large parts of the muslim world and marked one of the most powerful modern influences in Shia islam. And while it is true that ayatollah is a rank below grand ayatollah, the term \\"Ayatollah Khomeini\\" often colloquially used in the West, the title \\"Grand Ayatollah\\" might not have been as commonly used to refer to Khomeini in the English language. It's also worth noting that in addition to his religious roles, Khomeini proved to be a significant and complex political leader. He is credited with the foundation of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the end of the Pahlavi monarchy, but his political ideology continues to be a point of controversy. His political philosophy was a complex blend of political populism, anti-colonial armed resistance, and a religiously influenced social conservatism and government structure."},{"question":"andyourlipsfromspeakinglies.34:14Departfromevil,anddogood.

Close View Terror attack in Jerusalem, March 23, 2011 in a larger map Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich told Channel 2 that the bomb was about one to two kilograms (four pounds) and was planted in a small bag on the sidewalk. He said security services were on alert for additional attacks. The entrance to the city has been closed. Security forces were combing the area for other suspicious packages or objects. A Channel 2 reporter said that the Palestinian Red Crescent contacted the emergency services to offer assistance in evacuating the wounded. The 59-year-old woman who was killed in the explosion was believed to be a foreign citizen, and her name was not cleared for publication since her family has yet to be notified. The woman was seriously wounded as a result of the bombing, and rescue services transferred her to the emergency room in the Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital. Doctors fought for her life for about an hour and ultimately were forced to declare her dead. Officials in the hospital said that until the late evening hours no family or friends came to look for the woman, and noted that several documents that she possessed indicated that she was a foreign citizen. The bombing occurred just hours after Gaza militants fired two Grad-type Katyusha rocket at the southern city of Be'er Sheva and a barrage of mortar shells on the western Negev. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed his scheduled trip to Moscow in the wake of the Jerusalem bombing. Jerusalem has been hit by a number of terror attacks over the last few years, two of them involving tractor drivers that ploughed down a central street. In the first incident in July 2008, a bulldozer driver hit a bus, pedestrian and cars before he was neutralized by a soldier and civilian who mounted his vehicle and overtook him and then shot and killed him. The second attack took place three weeks later. Twenty-four people were injured in the attack, one of which moderately to critically wounded. The terrorist hit five cars before he was shot by a civilian and an IDF military border guard officer that were at the scene of the attack. Three months later, 19 people were injured - two of them critically and four moderately -when an East Jerusalem resident veered off the street onto the sidewalk near the Old City of Jerusalem and crashed into pedestrians. Most of the pedestrians were soldiers. An officer among the group open fire and killed the terrorist. The capital suffered dozens of suicide bombings that targeted buses and restaurants during the second Palestinian uprising last decade. Jerusalem last experienced a suicide bombing in 2004.

The bomb had been left in a bag by the side of the road near the central bus station, police said. Jerusalem suffered a spate of bus bombings by Palestinian militants between 2000 and 2004 but attacks had stopped in recent years. Israel's prime minister said the country would act aggressively to restore security. \\"Israel will act aggressively, responsibly and wisely to preserve the quiet and security that prevailed here over the past two years,\\" Benjamin Netanyahu said. He said the attackers sought to test the country's will and determination and said the Israeli people had \\"an iron will\\" to defend their country. Shattered windows Witnesses said the force of the blast - just after 1500 local time (1300 GMT) - shook buildings over a wide area. Dozens of ambulances converged on the scene near the entrance to the city, and police sealed off the area. It is believed the bomb exploded as a bus pulled up at the stop, but it is not clear if passengers on the bus were among the casualties. Israeli officials initially said no-one had been killed in the blast but later confirmed that a woman had died from her injuries. At the scene The explosion happened right in the heart of west Jerusalem - a city that has, for many years, been relatively peaceful. The target was the No 74 bus - its windscreen blown out by the force of the blast. There was shrapnel damage everywhere. But, unlike previous incidents, police say this was not a suicide bombing and there is now an urgent man-hunt going on for someone who, according to police, left a device at the bus stop and then ran away. Dozens of paramedics and emergency vehicles were quickly at the scene - treating more than 30 wounded people. Such a bomb attack in Jerusalem may not have happened for many years, but it comes at a time of increased tension in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Political leaders, Israeli and Palestinian, have condemned the upsurge in violence but many observers say these are tense moments and more violence may be inevitable. A correspondent for AFP news agency at the scene said people were lying on the ground covered in blood and many cars and buses had shattered windows. \\"(We believe) the device weighed about 1-2kg (2-4lb),\\" Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch told Israel's Channel 2 television. \\"It exploded in a small suitcase on the sidewalk next to the bus stop.\\" Motti Bukchin, a volunteer with the Israeli emergency service Zaka, said he and his colleagues were in a meeting nearby when they heard the blast. \\"When we arrived at the site of the attack we saw two women lying in huge pools of blood on the pavement. We began resuscitation immediately and were soon joined by other medical personnel. The two women were evacuated to hospital in serious to critical condition,\\" he said. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the BBC they were searching for a suspect and a vehicle believed to have been used in planting the bomb. Medics said many of the injured had shrapnel wounds. Three are seriously injured and five are in \\"a moderate condition, while the rest are less badly hurt\\", Uri Shacham, a senior paramedic told reporters. After the attack, Prime Minister Netanyahu met defence and security officials, delaying by a few hours a scheduled trip to Moscow where he is due to hold talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. 'Unacceptable' attack Jerusalem was hit by a series of bombings - mostly targeting buses and restaurants - during the second Palestinian uprising that began in 2000. However the attacks have stopped in recent years. Jerusalem last experienced a bus bombing in 2004. The latest attacks comes amid heightened tension in the Gaza Strip.

But an Islamic Jihad leader said a Palestinian attack would be a \\"natural response\\" to this week's Israeli strikes in Gaza. On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes launched fresh air strikes east of Gaza City, after Palestinian militants fired two rockets into southern Israel. Islamic Jihad said it carried out the rocket attacks in reprisal for the killing of eight Palestinians near Gaza City on Tuesday. Four of those killed were members of one family and two of them were children. Hamas government spokesman Taher Nono has refused to comment on the Jerusalem explosion.

A bomb exploded near a crowded bus, wounding at... (Associated Press) The bombing brought back memories of the second Palestinian uprising last decade, a period in which hundreds of Israelis were killed by suicide bombings in Jerusalem and other major cities. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Israeli police blamed Palestinian militants. The attack came against the backdrop of a rising wave of violence that has threatened to upset more than two years of relative calm that has prevailed since an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip. Earlier this month, five members of a Jewish settler family were knifed to death in their sleep at their West Bank home. And in recent days, Israel has carried out reprisals in Gaza in retaliation for rocket and mortar fire launched into southern Israel. On Tuesday, an errant Israeli strike meant for Palestinian militants killed four members of a Palestinian family in Gaza. Adding to the tensions, peace efforts with Hamas' rival, the Western-backed Palestinian government in the West Bank, have been stalled for months. Palestinian leaders condemned the attack. Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak hinted that Israel would retaliate against Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza. At least three rockets landed in the southern city of Beersheba on Monday, and mortar shells were landing in southern Israel late in the afternoon. \\"We will not tolerate the harming of Israeli citizens, not in the south and not in Jerusalem,\\" Barak said. \\"Hamas is responsible for the firing of rockets toward Beersheba today and this responsibility has a price.\\" The 3 p.m. bombing occurred near the main entrance to Jerusalem, next to the city's central bus station and main convention center, an area that is crowded with travelers and passers-by. The bomb went off next to the a food stand ironically called, in a Hebrew play on words, \\"a blast of a kiosk.\\" The blast reverberated throughout Jerusalem and blew out the windows of two crowded buses. Rescuers removed bloodied people from the area on stretchers, as sirens from speeding ambulances wailed in the background. \\"We are talking about a terror attack,\\" said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. He said a 60-year-old woman died from her wounds. Israel's national rescue service said some 24 others were wounded, including three in critical condition. Jerusalem's police chief, Aharon Franco, said that the bomb was about four pounds (one to two kilograms) and was planted in a small bag on the sidewalk. He said security services were on alert for additional attacks. He said authorities had no firm leads but were investigating a possible link to a small bombing earlier this month that wounded a garbage collector as he removed the device from a trash can. \\"I saw kids crying on the street, lying in blood on the side of the road,\\" said one man who witnessed the blast. Crying on the telephone, he frantically tried to reach his daughter, calming down a bit when he found out she was safe. The man, trembling in shock, refused to give his name. Radio and TV stations posted emergency numbers for concerned citizens to inquire about relatives. Meir Hagid, one of the bus drivers, said he heard a loud explosion as he drove by the site, located near the main entrance to Jerusalem and its central bus station. \\"I heard the explosion in the bus stop,\\" he said. He halted his vehicle and people got off. He said nobody in his bus was hurt. Samuel Conik, 20, said he ran to the scene when he heard the explosion and saw fire coming out of a phone booth. Nearby was a badly burned man with bloody legs and his skin peeling off. At the scene, a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews began chanting \\"Death to Arabs.\\" Eli Yishai, Israel's interior minister, rushed to the scene and called for swift Israeli retaliation. \\"With these murderers, these terror organizations ... we must act, or we will lose our deterrence,\\" he told Channel 2 TV. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader had decided to delay a planned trip to Moscow for several hours to deal with the crisis. Police, accompanied by sniffer dogs, broke into cars near the site to search for evidence and possible additional explosives. The Palestinians are divided between two rival governments, the Hamas regime in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The West Bank government seeks peace with Israel, though talks broke down last September. In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad condemned the bombing \\"in the strongest terms.\\" His boss, President Mahmoud Abbas, who was traveling in Russia, issued a similar condemnation through his office. In the Gaza Strip, the Islamic Jihad militant group, which has carried out dozens of attacks, said it was not connected to the blast. But spokesman Khader Habib said the group \\"applauds all efforts to respond to the crimes committed daily against our people.\\" Jerusalem suffered dozens of suicide bombings that targeted buses and restaurants during the second Palestinian uprising last decade. But the attacks have halted in recent years. Jerusalem last experienced a suicide bombing in 2004, and the last suicide bombing in Israel occurred in 2008 in the southern town of Dimona. Even so, the city has experienced other deadly violence. In early 2008, eight students at a Jerusalem seminary were killed when Palestinian gunmen entered the school and opened fire. Palestinians also carried out several attacks with construction vehicles against Jerusalem in the past few years that ended with fatalities when the drivers rammed their vehicles into bystanders. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A bomb exploded at a crowded bus stop in Jerusalem, killing a 59-year-old woman and hurting at least 30 people.

And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. To celebrate the iconic program's fortieth anniversary, InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women's at-work style. \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' Mary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples, including double-breasted coats, knee-high boots, and that famous blue tam.

See all 10 shows that influenced women's at-work wardrobes \\"Dynasty\\" Okay, so the Carrington women weren't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers. Nevertheless, the big-shouldered, wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis (Joan Collins) and her longtime rival Krystle (Linda Evans) were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line, \\"The Dynasty Collection\\" which was designed by the show's costumer, Nolan Miller. \\"Ally McBeal\\" In 1998, shortly after the show's first season finale, Ally McBeal's disembodied head appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with the question, \\"Is Feminism Dead?\\" Despite the conclusions reached by that article (is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B. Anthony and Gloria Steinem?), women do owe something to the flighty young lawyer played by Calista Flockhart: She almost singlehandedly made the workplace safe for bare legs, freeing us from the tyranny of mandatory pantyhose. 1.

They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. But I can use this background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

Is it possible to start a business with (almost) no money? How do I start business, if I have no money? Available choices: 1). no. 2). yes.","response":"2). Yes. Both questions essentially ask whether or not one can start a business with little or no money. Although they are phrased differently, they share the same core question – establishing a business without a substantial financial investment. This idea of starting a business on a tight budget is not only possible but also quite common, especially among entrepreneurs and small business owners. Here is how someone might go about doing so: 1. Choose a low-cost business model: Starting a business without much money often means turning to business models that require minimal upfront capital. Some examples include freelancing, dropshipping, affiliate marketing, and consulting services. 2. Validate your idea: Before delving into business logistics, make sure your idea is viable and solves a real problem or meets a specific demand. Conduct market research, seek feedback from potential customers, and analyze potential competitors. 3. Leverage your skills: Consider what unique skills, expertise, and talents you possess that could be applied to your business venture. This not only minimizes expenses but also adds value to your offering. 4. Plan strategically: Develop a solid business plan that outlines your goals, strategies, and timeline while taking your low budget into account. Identify any potential obstacles and make informed decisions regarding your target audience and marketing strategies. 5. Utilize free or inexpensive resources: There are many low-cost or free tools and resources available for your business, such as website builders, marketing platforms, and management tools. Take advantage of them to get your business off the ground and running. 6. Network and form partnerships: Connect with professionals within your industry or niche. Attend networking events, join online forums, and reach out to potential mentors. Valuable partnerships can not only provide advice and guidance but also lead to business or client referrals. 7. Bootstrap your finances: Bootstrapping involves managing your business with revenue from clients or customers rather than external funding. This means you will have to be resourceful by re-investing earned money in the company, cutting unnecessary costs, and constantly optimizing your operations. 8. Offer great customer service: With limited resources, focus on delivering exceptional customer experiences. Positive word-of-mouth can boost your reputation without having to spend a fortune on advertising. 9. Be prepared to adapt and pivot: When starting a business without much money, flexibility is key. Have contingency plans and be ready to shift strategies when necessary. 10. Seek alternative funding options: While you may not have money personally, there are other funding options such as crowdfunding platforms, small business grants, or even local business competitions that can give you the financial support needed to launch and grow your venture.
