It's kind of like Chess (which even that is a challenge for me) with laser beams.I know that she doesn't play it much any more (lack of intelligent players perhaps?), but it is a very cool game with a lot of strategy involved.If your kid is pretty smart, I'd say \\"buy it\\" and let the game help them grow intellectually.

Parent feedback: The parent points out that their intellectually inclined children really enjoyed the game, which implies that it might be a good product for other kids with similar interests.\\n\\n2. Intellectual challenge: The game is likened to Chess but with an added twist (laser beams), meaning it has elements of strategy and could potentially help in the cognitive development of the child.\\n\\n3. Potential for growth: The reviewer notes that the game could help children grow intellectually, which would be appealing to many parents looking for enriching activities for their kids.\\n\\n4. Worth Even If Not Used: The reviewer suggests that buying such an educational game is better than getting a gift card that could be spent on less constructive items.\\n\\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are a couple of counterpoints that could slightly decrease interest:\\n\\n1. Dwindling Interest: The parent mentioned that her child does not play the game much anymore. It's uncertain if this is due to a lack of interest over time or a shortage of capable opponents.\\n\\n2. Difficulty: The reviewer admitted they found the game (and even Chess, a relatively well-known game) challenging to grasp. If the purchaser might be put off if they are looking for a game to play with their child and think that this game could be too difficult. \\n\\nOverall, while it has a few potential negatives, the review largely presents the product in a positive and sophisticated light."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: building, foundation, site","response":"The architects and construction team convened on the site of the proposed project, meticulously inspecting the area where the building's foundation would be established, knowing well that this initial step, creating a solid and reliable base, was paramount for the integrity and safety of the monumental structure they were tasked to erect. As the cornerstone to a successful project, the foundation needed to be carefully planned, ensuring it would adequately support the weight of the proposed building, balancing both aesthetic appeal and structural practicality. \\n\\nFurthermore, they knew that their choice of foundation would profoundly impact the structure's ability to withstand various environmental factors, such as seismic activity and soil erosion. Soil tests were conducted, as understanding the nature of the site's ground composition is crucial for determining the type of foundation best suited for the building. Different kinds of foundations such as shallow or deep were considered, each with its own benefits and limitations. Shallow foundations are often chosen for sites with hard soil, and when the building’s load does not necessitate deep penetration. On the contrary, deep foundations can be chosen in case the top soil layer is not strong enough to sustain the load of the building.\\n\\nAs they worked tirelessly, their minds raced with intricate calculations, each knowing their professional reputation, and more importantly, the safety of those who would work, live, or simply spend time in the completed building hung in the balance. Yet, the responsibility didn't overwhelm them; instead, it motivated them to strive for excellence. Each day on the site brought them one step closer to seeing the building rise from its carefully designed foundation - a testament to their painstaking work, expertise, and commitment to quality and safety.\\n\\nIndeed, the process of laying the foundation on a building site is much more than just a physical act; it is a science that requires meticulous planning and execution, and a thorough understanding of the relationship between the building, its foundation, and the site on which it is built. It's a collaborative endeavour, bringing together diverse professionals - architects, engineers, contractors, and laborers - who tirelessly work together to translate intricate architectural designs into tangible structures, built on firm and reliable foundations, truly embodying the saying 'well begun is half done'."},{"question":"The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will board a barge and lead a flotilla along the canal on Wednesday.\\nThe Queen Elizabeth II Canal section has been built as part of the Â£43m Helix project, which features the Kelpies sculptures.\\nThe royal couple will also carry out engagements in Stirling Castle and Perthshire during a three-day visit.\\nScottish Canals chairman Andrew Thin, Scottish Canals, said: \\"This event is a fitting culmination of more than a decade of hard work that saw the partners and the local community come together to turn an ambitious idea into reality and breathe new life into the area.\\"\\nFalkirk Council leader Cecil Meiklejohn said: \\"The official naming of the canal is another huge landmark in the Falkirk area's transformation from an industrial heartland to one of Scotland's best tourist destinations.\\"\\nWhat is a summary of this text?","response":"The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will lead a flotilla along the recently constructed Queen Elizabeth II Canal section as part of the £43m Helix project, which features the Kelpies sculptures.

He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history.

In response to this , the Conservative Party of Robert Manion ran on a platform advocating the creation of an all - party national unity government and ran under the name \`\` National Government '' in this election . Though Manion was personally opposed to conscription , the Liberals faced intense pressure in Quebec on the question and promised not to institute the measure .

As a child, Raizo experiences severe training under the guidance of his \\"father\\", Lord Ozunu (Sho Kosugi): he is whipped and/or cut whenever he fails and is encouraged to hurt his ninja kin for their training failures. The only kindness he ever receives is from a kunoichi (female ninja), Kiriko (Anna Sawai).As they grow older, Kiriko and Raizo develop a romantic bond, however Kiriko's desire to leave the Ozunu Clan for freedom is greater.One stormy night, Kiriko decides to escape from the clan. She encourages Raizo to join her, but he decides to stay. They kiss and she then climbs over the wall to freedom; only to be caught and brought back by her ninja kin. Branded as a traitor, Kiriko is executed (a katana through her heart) by her elder ninja brother Takeshi (Rick Yune). As a result of Kiriko's death, Raizo begins to harbor resentment and doubt towards the clan.After completing his first assassination, Raizo is instructed by Lord Ozunu to execute an escaped kunoichi like Kiriko. He rebels against his master by slashing his face with a kyoketsu shoge and fights against his ninja kin. Barely surviving, he escapes by falling into a nearby river.

How will it affect if there is less water available? Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?\\n\\nStep by step analysis with justifications:\\n\\nStep 1: You find an empty ice cube tray.\\n- Justification: The ice cube tray is necessary to hold and shape the water into ice cubes during the freezing process. Rainfall does not have a direct impact on this step, as the availability of an ice cube tray is unrelated to the weather conditions.\\n\\nStep 2: You fill the tray with warm water.\\n- Justification: Warm water is used to create clearer ice cubes due to the evaporation of gasses. The heavy rainfall might affect the availability of water if it results in flooding or issues with the water supply. However, this may depend on the local infrastructure and water management system. In most cases, heavy rainfall should not have a significant effect on the availability of water for filling the ice cube tray.\\n\\nStep 3: You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degrees Fahrenheit, the freezing point of water.\\n- Justification: The temperature and placement of the tray are crucial to ensure that the water will freeze properly and evenly. Heavy rainfall does not have a direct impact on the freezer's temperature or the placement of the tray.\\n\\nStep 4: The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid.\\n- Justification: The freezing process takes place due to the low temperature in the freezer. Rainfall does not affect this step, as the freezer's temperature is controlled independently of external weather conditions.\\n\\nStep 5: The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has a greater volume as a solid.\\n- Justification: This is a property of water and the freezing process; heavy rainfall has no direct effect on the expansion of water as it freezes.\\n\\nStep 6: Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses.\\n- Justification: Using warm water helps achieve clear ice cubes by removing trapped gasses. Rainfall does not have a direct impact on the gasses in the water or the resulting ice cube clarity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the given perturbation of heavy rainfall generally does not have a direct or significant indirect effect on the process of making ice cubes. The availability of water might be affected in specific localized situations, but overall, the process stays mostly unaffected by this external factor."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign.

The April 6 Movement, which figured prominently in the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak this year, issued a statement urging its members to descend on Cairo's Tahrir Square \\"immediately because resistance is the only solution.\\" \\"Down with military rule,\\" the movement said. The fighting erupted earlier in the day when police worked to clear the area of people who remained in the square after Friday's massive protests in Tahrir. Tens of thousands of Egyptians turned out Friday to protest plans for a constitution that would shield the military from public oversight. As evening came Saturday, police blanketed the square and fired tear gas. The security forces soon withdrew and stationed themselves at the Interior Ministry. Warning shots were heard throughout the day. Thousands of protesters remained at the scene. They chanted against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which rules Egypt, and Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the council who is effectively the interim ruler of Egypt. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks and torched a police van. Scuffles broke out on side streets and clouds of smoke rose from burned tires, witnesses said. Clashes between protesters and police also reportedly broke out in the cities of Suez and Alexandria. Two people died after being shot -- one in Cairo, one in Alexandria -- said Adel al-Dawi, a spokesman for the Health Ministry. State media reported that 750 people were injured, citing the Health Ministry. The Interior Ministry also said 20 police officers have been injured and eight people have been arrested. \\"We sent hundreds of Central Security Police Forces and forced out the remaining several hundred protesters who refused to go home. We arrested four thieves and thugs who acted aggressively and beefed up security in and around square overnight,\\" Interior spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said earlier Saturday. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the recent clashes and warned they could have a dangerous impact on Egypt, state media said. The Friday throng, dominated by Islamist parties but including secular protesters as well, turned out ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections set to begin on November 28. Mahmoud said the \\"Islamists and revolutionaries had left as they promised not to have a sit-in.\\" But stragglers remained, and he said many of the people who stayed in the square were families of those injured during the upheaval earlier this year that led to Mubarak's departure and the ushering in of the supreme council as interim rulers. Yousri Hamad, the official spokesman of the Al Noor Salafi Muslim political party, said he thinks that the violence could affect election plans. \\"The protesters are a bunch of kids that attacked the security forces which is a red line and could delay elections,\\" Hamad said. The military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president, but many citizens are dissatisfied with the pace of the transition and the resolve of the military rulers. But protesters were upset Friday about proposed principles for the constitution, in which the military's budget would not be scrutinized by civilian powers. They worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state. The outpouring reflected the power of Islamist forces in Egypt, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. A leader of that group called for restraint in the wake of Saturday's clashes, state media reported. The demonstrations occurred a day after hundreds of Coptic Christians marching in Cairo were attacked by unknown assailants. At least 32 people, including two police officers, were injured. They were heading to Cairo's Tahrir Square to commemorate the deaths of pro-Coptic protesters killed in clashes in the Egyptian capital last month. Problems between Egypt's Muslim majority and the Copts have been on the rise in recent months, with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups. Protests also stretched to the United States on Saturday, where demonstrators gathered in the nation's capital in opposition to military rule in Egypt. Protester Amin Mahmoud, a member of a group called the \\"Egyptian Organization for Change USA,\\" said Egypt's military \\"has been taking civilians before military courts, and we are against that. \\"They are torturing a lot of young revolutionaries, accusing them of being traitors, and that is not true,\\" he said. CNN's Alexander Hunter contributed to this report.","response":"There were very big fights between the police and protesters in Egypt.

It elected one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. In its last configuration, the electoral district included the communities of Fairview, Armdale, Cowie Hill, Fairmount and Kline Heights - all within the Halifax Regional Municipality.  - The Nova Scotia New Democratic Party is a social-democratic provincial party in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is aligned with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election. It is the first New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government. Much of the party's success prior to the 2009 election was based in the urban areas of the provincial capital, Halifax, however the party's support has grown to the rest of Nova Scotia.  - Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers with a widely varied landscape. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south.  - Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec: the three Maritime provinces  New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia  and the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011 was about 2,300,000 on half a million km.  - The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (from 1955 the \\"\\") was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist).  - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.  - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Learn about the social challenges. Learn about the behaviors of autistic individuals. Understand the importance of routine. Recognize the power of special interests. Get to know this person's strengths, differences, and challenges. Rid yourself of stereotypes about autistic individuals.\\"","response":"Title: Understanding and Supporting Autistic Individuals: Emotional, Social, and Behavioral Aspects\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nAutism, a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and behavior, affects millions of people worldwide. As awareness and acceptance of autism spectrum disorder grow, it is imperative to recognize the unique emotional and social challenges autistic individuals face. By having a comprehensive understanding of their behaviors, routine, and special interests, we can promote empathy, support their strengths, and break down stereotypes.\\n\\n1. Recognizing the emotional challenges autistic people face\\n\\nAutistic individuals often have different ways of experiencing and expressing emotions, which may lead to misunderstandings with others. They may struggle with emotional regulation, making it difficult to manage strong feelings such as anxiety or frustration. It is essential to acknowledge emotional challenges that autistic people face, and provide them with a supportive environment that promotes healthy emotional growth.\\n\\n2. Learning about the social challenges\\n\\nAutism affects how individuals interact with others. It may also cause differences in understanding body language, facial expressions, and social cues. Autistic people might find it challenging to maintain eye contact or engage in conversations, which may lead to isolation and feelings of loneliness. By learning about these social challenges, we can create more inclusive spaces that accommodate the social needs of autistic individuals.\\n\\n3. Understanding the behaviors of autistic individuals\\n\\nAutistic people may engage in behaviors such as stimming (self-stimulatory behavior), echolalia (repeating sounds or words), or intense focus on specific interests. These behaviors often help autistic individuals cope with stress or sensory input and enable them to express themselves. Recognizing the purpose behind these behaviors can help us support autistic individuals in managing their needs and create a positive environment.\\n\\n4. Acknowledging the importance of routine\\n\\nRoutine and predictability are crucial for many autistic people. Routines provide a sense of security and structure, making it easier to deal with unfamiliar or overwhelming situations. Disruptions in routine can cause anxiety and distress, so it is essential to be mindful of their routines and support them in maintaining consistency.\\n\\n5. Embracing the power of special interests\\n\\nMany autistic individuals develop strong interests, known as special interests, which often become an essential part of their identity. These interests can be therapeutic, providing an avenue for connection, relaxation, and self-expression. By recognizing the power of special interests, we can better understand the passions and talents of autistic people and help them channel their interests into meaningful activities.\\n\\n6. Appreciating individual strengths, differences, and challenges\\n\\nAutism is a highly varied and individualized condition, with each individual having their unique set of strengths, differences, and challenges. It is crucial to respect and appreciate the uniqueness of autistic individuals, as understanding their distinct perspectives and abilities can help us provide the right support tailored to their needs.\\n\\n7. Abandoning stereotypes about autistic individuals\\n\\nStereotypes about autism - such as lack of empathy or intelligence - are not only inaccurate but harmful. Dispelling these stereotypes and embracing the diversity within the autism community help create a more inclusive society where autistic individuals can thrive.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAs we continue to learn about autism and promote acceptance, it is crucial to recognize the emotional and social challenges autistic individuals face, understand their behaviors, and appreciate the importance of routine and special interests. With empathy, respect, and support, we can empower autistic individuals to live fulfilling lives while embracing their unique strengths and breaking down stereotypes."},{"question":"Read this fact: \\"earthworms create tunnels in soil\\"\\n\\nNow answer this question: \\"Moles are underground a lot of the time, and since few animals live there, they are unlikely to be\\"","response":"Eaten by other animals.

He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer .  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002.  - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

I think the answer is","response":"a). negative.\\n\\nThe sentiment of this review can be described as negative for several reasons. Although the reviewer does acknowledge some positive aspects of Pistol Parlour, such as the knowledgeable salesmen and excellent selection, the overall tone and focus of the review is directed toward the negative experiences encountered at the store. The main issues the reviewer emphasizes include high prices, difficulty getting help, being ignored or not taken seriously, and disrespectful treatment from the owner.\\n\\nThe negative aspects of the review heavily outweigh the positive aspects, as the reviewer lists numerous negative experiences and concludes by stating their intention to never return to the store.

In this context, to \\"give thought to\\" implies that one should consider or think carefully about the matter at hand. This meaning of \\"give\\" is more abstract and suggests a mental or emotional contribution rather than a tangible one.\\n\\nIn the second sentence, \\"I gave two sons to the war,\\" the term \\"give\\" is used in a different sense, conveying the meaning of presenting or offering something as a gift or sacrifice. Here, the speaker is indicating that they have lost two of their sons who participated in a war, and as a result, the implication is that their sons were given away, or sacrificed, for the cause of the war. This context reflects a more concrete sense of giving, as it involves the offering of something (or someone) with a tangible existence, such as the sons in this case.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although the term \\"give\\" is used in both sentences, it carries distinct meanings due to the contextual differences. In the first sentence, \\"give\\" pertains to the allocation of mental effort or consideration, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of presenting or offering something, often with a sense of sacrifice."},{"question":"In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: David Meyer probably believes that Options: - Multitasking is hard   - not enough information   - It is better to multitask   - People are too busy === The correct answer is\\nAnswer:","response":"David Meyer probably believes that multitasking is hard. This conclusion can be drawn from the information provided, which highlights Meyer's belief that multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. His statement that \\"doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency - and it would be, if a person had more than one brain,\\" further supports this notion, as it points out the limitations of the human mind in handling multiple tasks at once.\\n\\nMoreover, the text presents the negative effects of multitasking, such as slowing down the mind, causing rapid mental course changes, creating stress, and leading to the inability to effectively focus. All these factors indicate that Meyer views multitasking as a difficult and less efficient way of handling tasks, as opposed to focusing on one thing at a time.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that Meyer seems to believe in the power of the subconscious mind to handle the worrying aspect of multitasking, indicating that letting the subconscious handle certain aspects could potentially lead to better focus and effectiveness in the task at hand."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Okay, imagine you are at a playground with your friends.

But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than $500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people. \\nDo you have any questions?","response":"IBM built a big and fancy factory for making special computer parts called semiconductors. It cost a lot of money, like $2.5 billion. This factory is very important for IBM because they want to be the best at making these special computer parts to stay ahead of other companies. Semiconductors are used in big and small gadgets, like big computers, cell phones, and video-game consoles.\\n\\nIBM spends a lot of money, more than $500 million a year, on researching new ideas to make better semiconductors. The factory is in New York because it's close to where they do their research, which helps them make things faster.

Rather than taking equity in the startup, Moet Hennessy chooses a different route; they provide financial support for a specific project. This kind of investment offers startups the capital they need to invest in their business's growth, while also allowing the company to maintain its ownership structure.\\n\\nThis business arrangement involves the collaborative development of an exclusive product, service, or technology between the startup and Moet Hennessy. Throughout this partnership, both the startup and Moet Hennessy work together on creating a unique innovation, mutually beneficial to both parties. The outcome of their joint efforts is then reserved exclusively for Moet Hennessy during a specific time frame, which ranges from six to 24 months.\\n\\nThis period of exclusivity provides Moet Hennessy with the opportunity to capitalize on their investment and the innovative developments made during the partnership. At this time, the startup cannot market or offer the product, service, or technology to other companies. This allows Moet Hennessy to gain a competitive advantage by being the sole company with access to the innovation.\\n\\nHowever, once the exclusivity period ends, the startup gains the freedom to market, sell, or license the developed product, service, or technology to other businesses. This opens up additional revenue streams for the startup, while also potentially increasing their market presence and reach.\\n\\nOverall, this business model serves as a win-win solution for both Moet Hennessy and the partnered startup. Moet Hennessy benefits from the exclusive rights to the innovation, while the startup retains its ownership structure and subsequently gains access to new market opportunities after the exclusivity period. This collaboration approach fosters innovation and growth in the industry, by incentivizing startups to work towards developing cutting-edge products, services, or technologies."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What was created prior to 1950?\\" is in \\"After the establishment of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council.

A:\\nThe answer is:","response":"Looking directly at the Sun, which is a celestial object, can cause blindness. The Sun is a vast and powerful source of light and energy, being the primary source of warmth and light for our planet Earth. It is an immense, continuously burning ball of gas, primarily consisting of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. It is located at the center of our Solar System, with all planets and celestial bodies revolving around it. \\n\\nObserving the Sun with the naked eye, especially during its peak hours, can cause temporary or permanent damage to your eyesight, including blindness. The reason is that the Sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet rays (UV), which can harm the eye's delicate tissues, such as the retina or the lens.\\n\\nLooking directly at the Sun, even for a brief period, can induce a condition called solar retinopathy, which results from the excess intake of solar energy by the eye's retina. Solar retinopathy can lead to varying degrees of visual impairment, from temporary light sensitivity and afterimages to permanent blindness. Moreover, the pain receptors in the retina are usually absent, meaning that the damage caused may go unnoticed at first, and its symptoms are only identified later on.\\n\\nSolar eclipses are particularly dangerous in this regard. When an eclipse happens, the Moon partially or completely blocks the Sun's disk, leading people to believe that it's safe to stare directly at it. However, even during an eclipse, the Sun's edges emit potent UV rays, capable of leading to severe, irreversible eye damage.\\n\\nTo prevent eye injury caused by direct solar observation, it is crucial to take the necessary precautions, such as using specialized viewers or filters, like solar eclipse glasses, which are designed to block out the harmful rays. Another safe option is the projection method, such as a pinhole projector, which allows you to indirectly watch the event without facing the risks associated with staring at the Sun. It is worth noting that using ordinary sunglasses, smoked glass, or other makeshift filters is dangerous, as they may not provide adequate protection.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the celestial object that looking at directly can cause blindness is the Sun. Staring at the Sun without proper protection can have disastrous consequences on your eyes, such as temporary or permanent visual impairment, including solar retinopathy and blindness. To ensure your safety, always use appropriate protection, such as solar eclipse glasses or indirect viewing methods, when observing this powerful celestial body."},{"question":"What type of details about lorenzo clayton  can be gathered from the following bio?

[II] yes.\\nAre questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Question 1: Are there any good tools for managing DynamoDB?\\n\\nYes, there are several tools available for managing Amazon DynamoDB, including both official and third-party options. Some of these tools are:\\n\\n1. AWS Management Console: The primary and most straightforward method provided by Amazon itself. It allows you to create, manage, and monitor DynamoDB tables directly from the AWS Management Console.\\n\\n2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): AWS CLI is a command-line tool that enables you to manage DynamoDB resources and perform various operations on them. By using the AWS CLI, you can create, update, and delete tables, run queries, and much more.\\n\\n3. DynamoDB Local: This is a downloadable version of DynamoDB that enables you to develop and test your application locally without incurring any costs. It provides an identical environment as the actual DynamoDB, making it great for development and testing.\\n\\n4. NoSQL Workbench for Amazon DynamoDB: This is a cross-platform client-side tool provided by Amazon to visually design, create and manage DynamoDB tables, attributes, and indexes. It also supports both data modeling and visualization.\\n\\n5. Third-party tools: There are several third-party tools available for managing DynamoDB. Popular ones include Dynobase, DynamoDB-admin, and AWS-extend-switch-roles.\\n\\nQuestion 2: Why and how is Amazon DynamoDB so much cheaper than RDS?\\n\\nAmazon DynamoDB is generally considered to be more cost-effective than Amazon RDS for several reasons:\\n\\n1. Pricing Model: Amazon DynamoDB follows a pay-per-use pricing model, which means you only pay for the read/write capacity consumed and the amount of storage used. In contrast, Amazon RDS uses a pay-per-instance model, where you are billed for the instance itself, regardless of the actual usage.\\n\\n2. Autoscaling: DynamoDB allows you to configure autoscaling for your tables, scaling read and write capacity up or down based on the actual utilization. This means that you only pay for the capacity you actually use. While RDS also offers autoscaling, it is more focused on storage expansion, and manual scaling of instances is often required.\\n\\n3. Serverless Architecture: Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed and serverless NoSQL database service, which means that you do not need to pay for any underlying infrastructure, management, or maintenance costs. RDS, on the other hand, requires you to manage instances and deal with provisioning, patching, and backups.\\n\\n4. Flexibility: DynamoDB allows you to store both structured and unstructured data, which can be an advantage when compared to the strict design of relational databases. This allows for more efficient data storage and querying, potentially reducing costs.\\n\\nTo summarize, while both Amazon DynamoDB and RDS have their use cases and advantages, DynamoDB is generally considered to be more cost-effective due to its pay-per-use pricing model, autoscaling capabilities, serverless nature, and flexibility in handling data.\\n\\nRegarding your final question, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking about the tools available for managing DynamoDB, while question 2 is asking why and how Amazon DynamoDB is more cost-effective than Amazon RDS."},{"question":"Tweet: plp, have to go to gym and maybe swim, brb  see ya! #asot400\\nPredict the sentiment of this tweet.","response":"To predict the sentiment of this tweet, we will first break down the content and context of the message.

David Cameron has long faced criticism over how he has made Downing Street far too close to internet giants since he became Prime Minister. In summer, the concerns reached fever pitch when he appointed Joanna Shields, a former managing director of Facebook in Europe, to the Lords. Despite the fact that the firm has avoided paying its UK taxes, there is even speculation that she could one day be granted a ministerial role. The appointment deepened concerns that the Conservatives are too close to firms such as Facebook and Google and that they have the ear of the government on sensitive topics. Facebook is a US-based social network company set up by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Its UK arm is based in Covent Garden, and focuses mainly on advertising sales. Miss Shields had a long history in internet firms. She was the managing director of Google in Europe and Africa until 2006, and then chief executive of Bebo, another social networking site. She then went on to take the helm at Facebook, where she was managing director of the company’s European wing between 2008 and 2012 – around the time that the firm was accused of avoiding tax. Facebook UK only paid a small amount of corporation tax in 2011 – much lower than experts said would be expected. And in 2012, Facebook paid zero corporation tax in the UK. It was one of a number of global firms accused of registering subsidiary companies in low-tax countries to avoid paying their full British tax obligations. Facebook UK filed a pre-tax loss of £2.4million on turnover of only £34.6million, despite estimated ad revenues of £223million. The company pushed much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland. At the time, the chairwoman of the powerful Commons public accounts committee called it ‘deliberate manipulation of accounts’. And last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million in 2013. Despite the controversy over the firm’s tax affairs, Miss Shields was unveiled in 2012 as Mr Cameron’s digital adviser and chief executive of the government’s ‘Tech City’ to help boost internet start-ups in east London. The dual US and British national is a non-executive director of the London Stock Exchange. She also sits on Boris Johnson’s ‘smart board’ which aims to establish London as Europe’s digital capital. In August, Miss Shields was raised to the Lords – prompting Labour MP John Mann to say: ‘This is showing two fingers to every taxpaying business and taxpayer in the country, and it’s a green light to tax avoiders.’ Facebook says it always pays tax according to the laws of each country. Last month, Mr Cameron pledged tough actions to force companies such as Facebook – along with Google, Starbucks and Amazon – to meet their full UK tax obligations. ‘We’ve cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we’re the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here’s the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.’ But some will question whether the government, which has such close links to these firms, will really apply the required pressure. The Tories are even closer to Google, which has also been accused of avoiding tax. Their bosses enjoy regular access to senior ministers, while some Conservative employees have taken jobs with the company. For example, Rachel Whetstone, Google’s global head of communications, is a close friend of the Camerons and is married to Steve Hilton, the Prime Minister’ s ex-policy chief. And Naomi Gummer, a former adviser to Jeremy Hunt when he was Culture Secretary, is now a public policy analyst at Google.\\nSummarize the highlights of this article.","response":"David Cameron appointed Joanna Shields, a former managing director of Facebook in Europe, to the House of Lords, despite the tax avoidance controversy surrounding the tech giant.

Shields has an extensive background in the tech industry, having worked for Google and Bebo before taking her role at Facebook. During her time at Facebook, the company faced allegations of tax avoidance and paid little to no corporation tax. Shields was later named Cameron's digital advisor and CEO of the UK government's \\"Tech City\\" project.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process\\nA:","response":"The proposed perturbation would fall under the category of directly impacting a step of the process. This is because it interferes with the critical stage where the larva encases itself in the chrysalis and develops into the pupa, which ultimately grows into the adult butterfly.\\n\\nA chrysalis, or a pupa encasement, is highly crucial in a butterfly's life cycle. It's the stage where a larva undergoes metamorphosis to evolve into an adult butterfly. This process is delicate and vital for the survival and full development of the butterfly. Ensuring the security and undisturbed state of a chrysalis is important to the successful maturation of a butterfly, as any disruptions may lead to death, abnormal development or hinderance in successful maturation.\\n\\nThere are several ways that disturbing a chrysalis might lead to fewer butterflies successfully emerging. Firstly, the disturbance could physically damage the chrysalis, preventing the enclosed pupa from turning into a butterfly. This could lead to the premature death of the butterfly, or deformities that prevent it from living a full and normal adult life. \\n\\nSecondly, even if the disturbance doesn't cause direct physical harm, it could still stress the developing life form. Just as with humans and many other animals, high levels of stress can potentially hinder growth, damage health, and even shorten lifespans in insects too. The stress from a disturbance could stunt the pupa's development or even kill it outright.\\n\\nLastly, there's also a chance that the disturbance could expose the chrysalis to other threats, such as predators, harsh environmental elements or diseases. For instance, if something knocks the chrysalis off its perch, it could be left in a more exposed location where predators can more easily find and eat it. \\n\\nThus, by disturbing a chrysalis, it directly impacts the 'entering chrysalis' and 'growth inside the chrysalis' stages of the butterfly's life cycle, leading to a lower probability of survival or successful maturation. This, consequently, would result in fewer adult butterflies. By decreasing the number of successfully maturing butterflies, this perturbation also indirectly impacts the 'adult butterfly laying eggs' step, as fewer butterflies means fewer eggs laid and hence fewer butterflies in the subsequent generation. So, the direct disturbance indirectly affects the lifecycle continuity too."},{"question":"Dialogue:\\nLinda: Hi guys, we thought about going to italy for 2-3 weeks this summer, any suggestions where?\\nSusanne: you and John?\\nJohn: yup! 🙋‍♂\\nThomas: Maybe Sicily?

That includes a $200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from $900,000 to $1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was $374,062, the report states. Newman also has a $5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing. \\n\\nAfter reading the above, is \\"2011\\" the correct answer to the question \\"In which year did Steven L.

Newman receive a bonus of $374,062?\\", as the article stated that Transocean declared 2010 to be \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history\\" and then awarded executives with bonuses and raises, including the $374,062 bonus for Steven L. Newman.

They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically   in communities across the Washington region and the nation.

Investigations have been launched and the girl's mother is calling for policy changes. \\n  \\n Officer Kevin Brown, 55, was working an off-duty security detail at the Spring Grove Village Kroger, police said. He was investigating a group of juvenile girls suspected of stealing from the store. \\n  \\n According to police officials, Brown approached one of the girls, but she ignored his commands to stop and kept walking out of the store.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) \\n  \\n Chief Eliot Isaac said he was \\"extremely concerned\\" any time force is used on a child of this age. He said his department would begin a thorough review of the policies concerning the using force on juveniles. \\n  \\n Brown was placed on restricted duties pending an investigation into his actions. \\n  \\n When they are effective, Tasers fire two barbs that can embed in the skin and electrically shock a person, resulting in incapacitation. \\n  \\n Cincinnati police are told Tasers can be used on people, ages 7 to 70, actively resisting arrest, which in some cases includes fleeing from officers or ignore commands to stop, according to the department's procedure manual. \\n  \\n “An individual simply fleeing from an officer, absent additional justification, \\n  \\n does not warrant the use of the TASER,” the manual states. “The TASER may be deployed on a suspect actively resisting arrest when there is probable cause to arrest the suspect.” \\n  \\n Officers are told to weigh the severity of the crime and the risk the suspect poses to the public. \\n  \\n \\"The preferred target area is the back of the individual actively resisting arrest,” the manual states. \\n  \\n Last year, the Chicago Police Department revised its Taser policy, advising officers not to shock people who run away, are intoxicated or could fall and suffer a head injury. \\n  \\n Gowdy said her daughter went down face first into the floor when she was struck by the Taser. According to police reports, the girl is 4-feet, 11-inches tall and weighs 90 pounds. \\n  \\n It is unclear if the incident was caught on surveillance cameras. Police officials said Brown was wearing a body camera but did not activate the camera until after the Taser was used. \\n  \\n The department's policy on body cameras states officers are required to activate the devices during all law enforcement-related encounters, but also says under extenuating circumstances, using the cameras may not be possible. \\n  \\n Gowdy wants to know more. She questioned why Brown acted the way he did while working an off-duty detail, and why officers are told that Tasers are an acceptable tool to use on children. \\n  \\n \\"I just want justice,\\" Gowdy said. \\"Not just for mine, but for others, too.\\" \\n  \\n Read or Share this story: https://cin.ci/2MrC8T2 |||||\\nWhat is a summary?","response":"An 11-year-old girl was tasered by a police officer in Cincinnati, Ohio, after allegedly stealing a backpack full of food from a supermarket.

After the terrible car accident, his whole world had been completely dark and quiet for almost ten years. The loss of sight and hearing made him try many times to put end to his life.

On a hot summer afternoon he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started suddenly. He stood under a large tree in order not to get himself wet. Unfortunately he was struck down to the ground by a lightning. The witnesses thought him dead but he woke up some 20 minutes later lying face down in muddy water below the tree. He felt that he was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes ,he didn't dare to believe that he saw a plough(  )lying near the wall. When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of Robert's regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread in his area. And many doctors came to prove the truth of the news. Most of them said that he gained sight and hearing again obviously from the knock of lightning; none of them could give convincing reasons, however. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since Edwards lost his sight and hearing as a result of sudden shock in a terrible accident, perhaps the only way for them to regain was by another sudden shock.

Russia's success at Azov strengthened its positions during the Karlowitz Congress of 1698-1699 and favored the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople in 1700.As Azov's harbor was not convenient for the military fleet, the Tsar selected another more appropriate site on July 27, 1696, on the cape Tagan-Rog . On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels. In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that \\"Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects\\", had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns.

But if you consider China’s history and the notion of deference — which is really at the core of everything Chinese, so to speak — you realize that, in fact, it’s quite the opposite: that a firm handshake is an indication of presumption, possibly arrogance, and a weak one certainly isn’t disrespectful. So you offer your hand, absolutely, just don’t expect a particularly firm shake and don’t misconstrue it as something else.\\n\\nAnything to keep in mind about greetings?\\n\\n­Many times people in China have business cards or social cards, if they are not necessarily in business. First thing you should be aware of is the deference that you should attach to a business card. You accept it with both hands, you make a point of looking at it; that’s a sign of respect. The most staggering example of poor deportment from a Chinese perspective: I was in a series of negotiations, and we were coming to a positive conclusion, and my colleague, a Westerner, not really thinking, began to clean his fingernail with the business card. And that was that. The deal disappeared.\\n\\n­You must try everything, even if something looks aggressively weird. To refuse anything is a loss of face to the host. What happens inevitably is that you’re seated at a round table — there are few rectangular tables in China because in the middle of the table, no matter how posh the circumstances, is what we call a Lazy Susan — and as the food arrives, the host moves it in a clockwise motion toward you, and he will serve himself last. All at the table know to save for the guest the last bites of the most coveted food. If you were a little boy bent on torturing your little sister, you could not come up with some of these possibilities — not in your wildest imagination. My favorite example was a penis of a deer in leek bulbs. Best thing to do is not to ask what you’re eating.\\n\\nAlso, if you do not drink or have a low resistance, as I do — I mean, I’m a very cheap date — you must indicate that immediately, even stretch the truth and say you have a medical condition, otherwise you’re in for the long haul. They are promiscuous toasters.\\n\\nDoes any part of Beijing remind you of the city you saw three decades ago?\\n\\n­Dongzhimen is interesting because it once was Beijing’s northeastern gate that led to the countryside, and now it’s within the second ring of six roads; that’s how much the city has grown. There you can find hutongs, these dwindling labyrinths of narrow streets, formed by rows of what used to be courtyard residences dating back to the 13th century. Along them are these carts serving whatever is fresh to the locals, with these tiny little tables and even smaller little stools. You’re crouching, literally slurping next to the person next to you, and it’s wonderful.\\nWhat was this article about?","response":"This article is about Eden Collinsworth, an American publishing executive who wrote a best-selling book on Western etiquette for Chinese businessmen. The article talks about different ways of doing business in China, how to greet people, and how to handle business cards with respect.

Options: - profanity - content - irreverence - blasphemy - contempt\\nAnswer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Bill treated James with \\"irreverence.\\" This option aligns with common sense because it indicates a lack of respect and proper regard for James' feelings, contrasting against James' religious reverence for Bill. An in-depth analysis of each option is given below to help clarify this choice:\\n\\n1. Profanity: This option represents the use of offensive language or swearing. While it is possible that Bill could have treated James using profanity, it is not the most logical choice based on the information provided.\\n\\n2. Content: This option implies satisfaction or happiness, which doesn't align with the situation described. The context suggests a negative relationship between Bill and James, making this option unsuitable.\\n\\n3. Irreverence: This term indicates a lack of respect or disregard for someone, which seems to fit the context the best. James had a high level of admiration for Bill, and Bill's lack of reciprocation can be described as irreverent.\\n\\n4. Blasphemy: Blasphemy refers to speaking sacrilegiously about religious or sacred matters. Although James' admiration for Bill is described as \\"almost religious,\\" there is no indication that their relationship directly relates to religious or sacred matters. Therefore, this option does not best fit the context.\\n\\n5. Contempt: Contempt pertains to a strong feeling of disapproval or disdain. While Bill could potentially treat James with contempt, which would involve more intense negative emotions, the information provided leans more toward disrespect without necessarily implying such strong disapproval.\\n\\nTo summarize, considering the context provided in the question, Bill treating James with \\"irreverence\\" is the option most in line with common sense. This choice reflects the lack of respect and regard that Bill had for James, who held Bill in high esteem."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Ok Very super😊😊😊😊😊\\"\\nA:","response":"★★★★★"},{"question":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Johns formally assumed the role of a co-producer. The album name means \\"a world within a world\\". Most tracks came from Johns' new-found method of writing material on a piano, a technique he developed during the band's break after Neon Ballroom.In order to complete the vision for Diorama, several other musicians contributed to the album, including Van Dyke Parks, who provided orchestral arrangements to \\"Tuna in the Brine\\", \\"Luv Your Life\\", and \\"Across the Night\\". Paul Mac (from Itch-E and Scratch-E) and Jim Moginie (from Midnight Oil) both on piano also collaborated with the band. While recording Diorama, Johns referred to himself as an artist, rather than simply being in a \\"rock band\\". Upon its release, critics commented that the album was more artistic than previous works.Early in December, the first single, \\"The Greatest View\\", was released to Australian radio networks. Its physical release in January 2002 coincided with the band's appearance on the Big Day Out tour. Early in 2002, Johns was diagnosed with reactive arthritis which made it difficult for him to play the guitar and subsequent performances supporting the album's release were cancelled. In March, Diorama was issued and topped the ARIA Albums Chart – it became their fourth number-one album and spent 50 weeks in the top 50.Five singles were released from the album: \\"The Greatest View\\", \\"Without You\\", \\"Luv Your Life\\", \\"Across the Night\\", and \\"After All These Years\\" – \\"The Greatest View\\" charted highest, reaching No. 3. In October, Silverchair were successful at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, winning five awards including 'Best Rock Album' and 'Best Group', and 'Producer of the Year' for Johns. The band played \\"The Greatest View\\" at the ceremony: the song was also nominated for 'Best Video'. Two singles (and a related video) were nominated for further ARIA Awards in 2003.

Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors.

Brennan is offered a job at the Willis Aircraft Company as chief test pilot for an experimental high speed jet fighter known as the JA-3, designed by Carl Troxell (Richard Whorf). Troxell is also a link to Brennan's past, having known him in the war when Brennan was a bomber pilot. A flashback to B-17 missions over Germany reveal Brennan to be a top-notch pilot. Another connection to his past is his former flame, Jo Holloway (Eleanor Parker), now Willis' secretary. In order to prove the capabilities of the new JA-3, capable of speeds up to 1,400Â mph (2,300Â km/h), Brennan convinces Willis that a record-breaking flight from Nome, Alaska to Washington D.C., via the North Pole, will impress the government. At the same time, Troxell tries to develop a safer version of the revolutionary aircraft, the JA-4, equipped with an escape pod, but dies during a test flight. The earlier record flight is a success with Brennan earning a $30,000 paycheck, enough to marry Jo. Then he learns that Troxell has been killed. Despite his earlier reservations about the need for safety systems, Brennan takes another JA-4 out for the official government demonstrations, using the escape pod to prove that the new aircraft is safe. On landing, he falls into the arms of his beloved.\\nA:","response":"\\"Skybound: The Race for Supersonic Glory\\""},{"question":"Teacher:Given a set of four words, generate the category that the words belong to.

The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's...\\nA:","response":"The full name of the person whose actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government in the article is Sam Houston."},{"question":"Mucus (/ ˈmjuːkəs / MEW-kəss) is a slippery aqueous secretion produced by, and covering, mucous membranes. It is typically produced from cells found in mucous glands, although it may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both serous and mucous cells. It is a viscous colloid containing inorganic salts, antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes), immunoglobulins, and glycoproteins such as lactoferrin and mucins, which are produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands. Mucus serves to protect epithelial cells (that line the tubes) in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, visual, and auditory systems; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish, against infectious agents such as fungi, bacteria and viruses. The average human nose produces about a liter of mucus per day. Most of the mucus produced is in the gastrointestinal tract.\\n\\nAnswer this question: what role does mucus play in the respiratory system? Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"Mucus plays a vital role in the respiratory system by providing a protective layer to the epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract. This moist, viscous substance traps dust, microorganisms, and other airborne particles as they enter the respiratory system, preventing them from reaching the lungs. Additionally, mucus contains antiseptic enzymes such as lysozymes and immunoglobulins, which help to combat potentially harmful pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\\n\\nThe cilia, tiny hair-like structures on the surface of the epithelial cells, work in coordination with mucus to filter debris and move it towards the mouth or nose so it can be expelled from the body, either by swallowing or through sneezing or coughing. This process is known as the mucociliary escalator. By keeping the respiratory tract clean and free from irritants, mucus contributes to maintaining healthy lung function and preventing respiratory infections."},{"question":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Add decorative touches to your shoes. Take them for a test walk!\\"\\n\\nArticle:","response":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Waterproofing and Revamping Your Shoes with Sealant Spray\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nWe all know that it can be quite disappointing when our favorite pair of shoes gets wet and damaged, especially while we're enjoying the great outdoors. However, there is a simple solution to prevent this issue: waterproofing your shoes with a sealant spray. But why stop there? You can also add decorative touches to revamp your shoes and take them for a test walk to ensure their comfort and sturdiness! In this article, we will provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you waterproof, personalize, and properly test your shoes.\\n\\nStep 1: Choose the Right Sealant Spray\\n\\nBefore you begin the process, it is important to choose the appropriate sealant spray for your shoes. There are different types of spray available, such as silicone-based or acrylic-based. Consider the materials of your shoes and pick a suitable waterproof spray that works well with those materials. You can find sealant sprays in most shoe stores or online markets.\\n\\nStep 2: Prepare Your Shoes\\n\\nTo ensure the best results, make sure to thoroughly clean your shoes before applying the sealant spray. This allows the spray to adhere better to the material. Remove any dirt or dust particles using a cloth, and allow the shoes to dry completely before moving on to the next step.\\n\\nStep 3: Apply the Sealant Spray\\n\\nOnce your shoes are clean and dry, you can apply the sealant spray. Follow the instructions provided on the spray bottle and evenly coat the entire shoe surface. It is important to apply the spray in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling any harmful fumes. Allow the sealant to dry for the recommended time provided by the manufacturer. This will ensure that the sealant fully bonds to the shoe materials, providing reliable waterproofing.\\n\\nStep 4: Add Decorative Touches\\n\\nNow that your shoes are waterproof, you can move on to the fun part – adding decorative touches! There are endless ways to personalize your shoes, so use your creativity and imagination to make them uniquely yours. You can use fabric paint, stitching or embroidery techniques, or even sew on patches or appliqués. Make sure that the decorations you add do not compromise the waterproofing of your shoes.\\n\\nStep 5: Take Your Shoes for a Test Walk\\n\\nOnce your shoes are dry and all your decorations are securely in place, it's time to take them for a test walk. This will ensure that your shoes are comfortable, and the sealant and decorations are properly set in place. It's also a great opportunity to show off your new and improved shoes! Walk around your neighborhood or go for a short hike to test how your shoes hold up in different environments. Check for any discomfort or signs of wear that need addressing.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWaterproofing your shoes with a sealant spray not only adds a protective layer to your footwear but can also be an excellent opportunity to personalize them with decorative touches. Following this step-by-step guide, you'll be able to turn heads with your unique, waterproof shoes. So, gear up and confidently step into any terrain without worrying about your shoes getting wet or damaged.

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others.

Usually, I can just let my (medium-sized) dog out in the yard to do his thing. But with the snow so high, he seems really confused, and in order for him to even pee over the past few days, I've had to leash him and take him for a walk around the neighborhood. What do dogs \\"see\\" when there's this much snow? An impenetrable white shield? Does the lack of smells or covering up of smells throw them off? When the snow is a few inches high, he loves to play in it, but this time he was stymied. Any thoughts?\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: Some dogs love snow (our little canine cocktail Quixote who uses his stubby legs to push nose through the snow like a snowplow) and others like my daughter's Pugs hate the snow and want to go #1 and #2 in the house. Since we babysit the pugs a lot and don't want our house to be their bathroom, we simply shovel an area for them to go potty in. In the Spring when the snow is off the ground, the area looks like it's been carpet bombed.\\n\\nanimal shelter needs: Dr. Becker, thanks for doing this chat, could you please remind everyone that the animal shelters are in dire need of food and other supply donations after these dreadful storms? A big bag of dog food, some cat litter, will be a huge help to the needy animal friends and their keepers.\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: Food is fuel and this is even more true in winter and when it's cold. It takes energy to stay warm, and food is the fuel that provides energy to the body. If your pet is outdoors some or all of the time, you may need to increase their food intake. Pets who are always or almost always inside may need less food in the winter because they can stay warm and are less active.\\n\\nBichon owner: Our little bichon frise is almost 14 and she shivers noticeably when coming in from out of doors. We've not noticed this in winters past. Is this a sign of aging or of something else, perhaps? It seems to take a while for her paws to warm up after she's been outside.\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: I have to say, I have a thing for older pets. Sometimes we confuse things like dimished senses, pets being not as playful, slowing down, not as social, more aggressive, sleeping patterns changed, changes in appetite as all being part of growing older. Same with shivering. There is a condition called Cognitive Disorder Syndrome of Canine Brain Aging (like early Alzheimer's) that causes most of these symptoms AND it is treatable. Ask your veterinarian if you pet could have CDS and about potent antioxidant cocktails such as Senilife (CEVA) and Novafit (Virbac) and also special brain diets like Hill's Prescription Diet b/d (stand for brain diet).\\n\\nWashington, DC: Should I be doing anything to my dog's paws before we go out and walk on chemically-treated streets and sidewalks?\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: There are lots of dangers on the streets right now. Make sure your pet doesn't come in contact with antifreeze that may have leaked out of a vehicle (it's lime green colored) as a single lick can be fatal. Also, make sure you use pet friendly antifreeze in your vehicle and double check to make sure your vehicle doesn't leak.\\n\\nThere are also pet friendly de-icers like SafePaw you can use. As far as protecting your pets, I recommend either putting doggy boots on your pets or putting a thin film of Vasoline on feet to protect them from ice and salt. You should also keep hair trimmed between the toes to prevent iceballs from building up. Lastly, if you don't have boots on your dogs, keep a shallow dish of water and a towel by the door so that when they come in from their walk you can just kdp their feet in the water and towel dry.\\n\\nI feel so bad for animals outside in this stuff and especially the feral cats you see occasionally.\\n\\nMy neighbor saw one small cat the day before the latest storm - when he approached it, it ran into the sewer drain along the side of the road. The next day, all that snow had piled over the entrance to the drain including that from the plow. He dug it open to give him a chance to get out - but what are the odds any cat would survive such a storm? What can they possibly eat - everything is covered in snow and it's freezing cold.\\n\\nI suppose being in the sewer drain is shelter, but what an awful existence. It's so sad.\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: I should use this as a chance to say that pet clothing isn't silly at all. Small dogs, older dogs and greyhounds and their cousins (whippets, Italian greyhounds) have a difficult time regulating body temperature, and really do benefit from pet apparel. There are eco-friendly dog sweaters made by West Paw Design.\\n\\nThe worst thing for any animal is wind. If a pet can get out of the wind, they'll typically survive. Ideally, for pets they need four walls and a roof.\\n\\nThe next worse thing is getting wet. A dry outdoor dog or cat fares much better than a wet one in cold temps. Being damp makes heat loss worse and hypothermia happen faster. If you can't keep your pets out of the wind or dry, bring them inside!\\n\\nAlso for outdoor pets, it's important the bottom of the shelter doesn't contact the ground and that the bedding is on top of several layers of foam or bubble wrap to prevent radiant heat loss.\\n\\nHerndon, VA: Do you have any advice on how to deal with sore paws from getting ice melt or other snow melt chemicals on them?\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: Again, boots to prevent the problem. Or put a light layer of Vasoline on the foot pads before you go out. Keep a dish of water and towel by the door to remove salt and deicer products.\\n\\nBe EXTRA EXTRA careful to keep your pets away from deicer products. If they lick or eat them it can cause serious electrolyte imbalances that can be fatal.\\n\\nSilver Spring, MD: I think my beagle is wondering if there are bunnies to chase the other side of Mt. Everest where I dug her out a potty area! She'll pee there but has been holding her poop except for one accident inside. Any suggestions?\\n\\nAlso, I haven't yet found what I consider an affordable set of boots for her -- that will both provide traction and be comfortable, i.e., flexible fabric. In the meantime I'm using Bag Balm on her paws. When is the best time to apply it? I'm afraid it'll be too slippery on ice. OTOH, her pads could -stick- to the ice without it.\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: I'm a huge all weather fan of having a cue word for dogs to go potty. Up at our Almost Heaven Ranch where it gets really cold, we use \\"Be Quick\\" for obvious reasons but it also doesn't sound quite as direct as saying \\"Go Potty\\" when you're around others. I recommend two things for all dog owners:\\n\\n1. Rewards - On occasion, give your dog the cue word to go #2 and then give it an indescribably tasty treat such as a piece of a warm hotdog or piece of chicken. It's like winning the lotto. I go outside, poo, and sometimes my mommy gives me this. Then your pet is much more likely to go when severe weather conditions strike.\\n\\n2. Vary the surface - For you puppy owners out there, NEVER have your dog just go potty on one substrate whether that's grass or concrete. Have them go as puppies on grass, concrete, gravel, snow, everything but the carpet. Then as adults, no matter the season or location, they'll think it's okay to go.\\n\\nKansas City MO: Hi Dr. Becker, thanks for taking time to answer our questions!\\n\\nI don't live in the DC area, but we get nasty weather in Missouri too. My husband and I work with our local shelter fostering dogs to increase their adoptability. The dogs we get often have 'kennel cough' which I know is usually a respiratory infection that we treat with antibiotics.\\n\\nMy question is what are some things we do to hurry their recovery? When we take them out in the awful cold they cough terribly, any ideas to decrease that?\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: Kennel cough is a problem whereever dogs are in close contact for long periods of time. It can be shelters, doggy daycare, dog parks, veterinary hospitals, etc. The only way to prevent is to keep your pet vaccinated against it with an intranasal or injectible vaccine (I vaccinate our own dogs against it every 6 months). The bad thing is it sounds like a dog with kennel cough is going to hack itself to death, but the lucky thing is it's really like the human's common cold. It is typically self-limiting and nothing really works to shorten it. Your veterinarian will only give antibiotics if there is a secondary bacterial infection\\n\\nRegarding the new canine influenze threat, veterinarians recommend it if your pet is also a candidate for kennel cough, if you have an at risk breed (breeds with pushed in faces), or if it's a problem in your area (like FL, KY, NY, CO).\\n\\nOver heating chiquaqua question: My 4year old male chiquaqua likes to sleep on one of our heater grates for hours on end. I worry about him boiling his brains but my husband says if he got too hot he would move. What do you think?\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: We jokingly say as vets (after a beer or two), never trust a dog that shivers in a warm room. :-) Seriously, as long as the dog can move, it will be fine. Some breeds are cold blooded (like Chihuahuas, Whippets, Greyhounds) and other dogs suffer from metabolic conditions like hypothyroidism that can cause shivering, weight gain, changes in haircoat.\\n\\nI recommend ALL pet owners take their pet to the vet twice yearly for wellness visits. It's so much better to catch things early on in that period of grace when you're much more likely to be able to treat or cure. Our goal as veterinarians is always to prevent unneccessary pain, expense or worse.\\n\\nAnonymous: Let's remember that there are a lot of former pets out there on the streets of DC, without homes or even shelter at all. I'm sure the folks who work at the local animal shelters, including Washington Humane Society, had to trudge through the blizzard to take care of the animals housed there. With more spaying and neutering, perhaps the next time the problem will diminish.\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: I agree with you 1000%. Right now at PetConnection.com we're working on a national effort to get beds for all shelter pets. We call it rise up (off the cold concrete), lie down (on a comfy bed) and move out (into a loving home). My friend Dr. Oz mentioned it on his Facebook page and for example, over the past three days we helped raise 100 beds for a shelter in Collier County FL. Please go to PetConnection.com or to Facebook/DrMartyBecker to find out how you can help in your community.\\n\\nGod bless all of you who work to help animals or give of yourselves (time, money, expertise).\\n\\nWashington, DC: Is the salt/chemical everyone uses, myself included, to melt ice and snow on the sidewalks harmful to dogs? Should I wipe the pup's paws after going outside?\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: Can be VERY dangerous if a pet ingests. Fatal even. Use SafePaw de-icer, protect your pet's feet with boots or wash off when come in (so they don't lick).\\n\\nDr. Marty Becker: I want to thank all of my pet loving friends for joining me again.

Gambler Nathan Detroit seeks to organize an unlicensed crap game, but the police, led by Lieutenant Brannigan, are \\"putting on the heat\\". All the places where Nathan usually holds his games refuse him entry due to Brannigan's intimidating pressure. The Biltmore garage is the only venue where Nathan can hold the game, but its owner requires a $1,000 security deposit, which Nathan doesn't have. Adding to his problems, Nathan's fiancée, Miss Adelaide, a nightclub singer, wants to bring an end to their 14-year engagement and actually tie the knot. She also wants him to go straight, but organizing illegal gambling is the only thing he's good at.  Then Nathan spots an old acquaintance, Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything and for high amounts. To win the $1,000 security deposit, Nathan bets Sky that he can't take a girl of Nathan's choosing to dinner in Havana, Cuba. The bet seems impossible for Sky to win when Nathan nominates Sergeant Sarah Brown, a sister at the Save a Soul Mission, which opposes gambling. To approach Sarah, Sky pretends that he is a gambler who wants to change. Sky suggests a bargain. He will get a dozen sinners into the Mission for her Thursday night meeting in return for her having dinner with him in Havana. With General Matilda Cartwright threatening to close the Broadway branch for lack of participation, Sarah has little choice left, and agrees to the date.\\nAnswer:","response":"The first name of the person the nightclub singer's fiance set as the target of a bet is Sarah.

A. Macedonski, Macedonschi or Macedonsky; March 14, 1854 - November 24, 1920) was a Wallachian, later Romanian poet, novelist, dramatist and literary critic, known especially for having promoted French Symbolism in his native country, and for leading the Romanian Symbolist movement during its early decades. A forerunner of local modernist literature, he is the first local author to have used free verse, and claimed by some to have been the first in modern European literature. Within the framework of Romanian literature, Macedonski is seen by critics as second only to national poet Mihai Eminescu; as leader of a cosmopolitan and aestheticist trend formed around his Literatorul journal, he was diametrically opposed to the inward-looking traditionalism of Eminescu and his school.\\n\\nMacedonski also returned with a new volume of poetry, Excelsior (consecutive editions in 1895 and 1896), and founded Liga Ortodoxa (\\"The Orthodox League\\"), a magazine noted for hosting the debut of Tudor Arghezi, later one of the most celebrated figures in Romanian literature. Macedonski commended his new protege for reaching \\"the summit of poetry and art\\" at \\"an age when I was still prattling verses\\". Liga Ortodoxa also hosted articles against Caragiale, which Macedonski signed with the pseudonym Sallustiu (\\"Sallustius\\"). The magazine was additional proof of Macedonski's return to conservatism, and largely dedicated to defending the cause of Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Ghenadie, deposed by the Romanian Synod following a political scandal. It defended Ghenadie up until he chose to resign, and subsequently went out of print. Macedonski was shocked to note that Ghenadie had given up his own defense.  In 1895, his Casa cu nr. 10 was translated into French by the Journal des Debats, whose editors reportedly found it picturesque. Two years later, Macedonski himself published French-language translations of his earlier poetry under the title Bronzes, a volume prefaced by his disciple, the critic and promoter Alexandru Bogdan-Pitesti. Although it was positively reviewed by Mercure de France magazine, Bronzes was largely unnoticed by the French audience, a fact which Tudor Vianu attributes to Bogdan-Pitesti's lack of qualification for the cultural mission Macedonski had trusted him with. By that time, his circle had come to be frequented with regularity by Bogdan-Pitesti's friend and collaborator, the celebrated painter Stefan Luchian, who was in the Symbolist and Art Nouveau stage of his career.  By 1898, Macedonski was again facing financial difficulties, and his collaborators resorted to organizing a fundraiser in his honor. His rejection of the Orthodox establishment was documented by his political tract, published that year as Falimentul clerului ortodox. Between that time and 1900, he focused on researching esoteric, occult and pseudoscientific subjects. Traian Demetrescu, who recorded his visits with Macedonski, recalled his former mentor being opposed to his positivist take on science, claiming to explain the workings of the Universe in \\"a different way\\", through \\"imagination\\", but also taking an interest in Camille Flammarion's astronomy studies. Macedonski was determined to interpret death through parapsychological means, and, in 1900, conferenced at the Atheneum on the subject Sufletul si viata viitoare (\\"The Soul and the Coming Life\\"). The focal point of his vision was that man could voluntarily stave off death with words and gestures, a concept he elaborated upon in his later articles. In one such piece, Macedonski argued: \\"man has the power [...] to compact the energy currents known as thoughts to the point where he changes them, according to his own will, into objects or soul-bearing creatures.\\" He also attempted to build a machine for extinguishing chimney fires. Later, Nikita Macedonski registered the invention of nacre-treated paper, which is sometimes attributed to his father.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: At this time, had he written any literature yet?","response":"Yes, at this time Alexandru Macedonski had written literature.

Dark clouds started rolling in, signaling an approaching storm. The atmosphere was heavy with the scent of rain, and the first droplets began hitting the ground as the girls hesitated. \\n\\nShould they continue or should they retreat? Lisa, the older and more confident of the two, decided that they wouldn't let a bit of rain dampen their spirits. Maddie, her younger sister, carried their brightly colored rainbow kite with both excitement and trepidation.\\n\\nAs they approached the large expanse of the park, they noticed that other people had left, seeking shelter from the storm. This only excited them further as now they would have the whole space to themselves. They sprinted to the center of the park, where the sturdiest trees stood, seeking protection from the wind and the rain.\\n\\nBefore they could unravel the kite, a loud clap of thunder shook the air, making both girls startle and catch their breath. This was turning into a more significant storm than they had anticipated. Lisa and Maddie exchanged worried glances, but neither wanted to be the first to give up.\\n\\nIgnoring their nagging doubts, Lisa unraveled the kite, as Maddie held onto it tightly. With a final nod of assurance, they began to run together, trying to catch the swift gusts of wind that the storm brought. The kite soared into the air, dancing wildly against the dark clouds, and the rain started falling more heavily.\\n\\nThe girls, soaked to the bone, laughed with glee and surprise at their defiance of the weather. They continued maneuvering the kite as best as they could, battling the storm like it was an exhilarating adventure. The wind howled, tugging the kite vigorously as the sisters tried hard not to lose control.\\n\\nJust as the girls were getting the hang of the powerful gusts and guiding their kite smoothly, a deafening boom of thunder cracked the sky, illuminating their surroundings with bright, blinding light. Seconds later, a bolt of lightning struck close to their location, making both of them jump back frightfully.\\n\\nRealization finally hit them that perhaps they were out of their depth. The sisters looked fearfully at one another, soaked and shivering, their clothes sticking to their bodies. What had begun as a lighthearted attempt at thrill-seeking had now turned into a dangerous pursuit, and they knew it was time to seek shelter.\\n\\nThey relinquished their grip on the kite, watching it carried away by the fierce wind. Lisa held Maddie's hand tightly as they hurried back from where they had come, bounding over puddles and navigating slippery paths. The euphoria of earlier was replaced by pounding hearts and anxious breaths, as they felt the urgency of finding safety.\\n\\nUpon reaching home, battered by the storm but relieved to be in the warm shelter, they huddled under their mother's embrace. As their shivering faded away and the rain outside softened to a gentle patter, the sisters recounted their adventure to their parents, describing the highs and lows they encountered in the park.\\n\\nTheir parents, torn between being glad the girls had bonded in such a way and worried about their safety, reminded them of the importance of recognizing and respecting nature's force.

Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful.

California's insurance commissioner said he and other regulators will examine whether the Indianapolis-based company is doing enough to prevent future breaches. ||||| The database of Indianapolis-based health insurer Anthem, which containing personal information for about 80 million customers and employees, has been hacked. WSJ's Stefanie Ilgenfritz reports. Photo: AP \\n  \\n Anthem Inc. ANTM 0.34 % stored the Social Security numbers of 80 million customers without encrypting them, the result of what a person familiar with the matter described as a difficult balancing act between protecting the information and making it useful. \\n  \\n Scrambling the data, which included addresses and phone numbers, could have made it less valuable to hackers or harder to access in bulk. It also would have made it harder for Anthem employees to track health care trends or share data with states and health providers, that person said. \\n  \\n The risks became clear last week, when Anthem discovered that hackers had broken into the database and made off with information on tens of millions of consumers, likely making it the largest computer breach disclosed by a health-care company. \\n  \\n Because the data wasn’t encrypted, it would be easily readable by hackers. The company believes a hacker group used a stolen employee password to access the database. \\n  \\n That storage decision has made the country’s second-largest health insurer the latest poster child for a continuing debate in executive suites: Is turning a corporate network into an electronic Fort Knox worth the potential cost? \\n  \\n Companies can employ random pass codes, limit access from outside the office or use complex math to scramble data. But those things slow companies down, sometimes to a degree they find unacceptable. \\n  \\n There is no evidence yet that identify thieves are using the data stolen from Anthem, it said. On Thursday, investigators began to focus on links to a group in China. Although the investigation remains in its early stages, the Anthem hack relied on malware and tools that have been used almost exclusively by Chinese cyberspies, investigators said. \\n  \\n At a daily press briefing on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the idea that the hackers were Chinese is “groundless,” and reiterated Beijing’s stance that the country is a victim and not a perpetrator of cyberattacks. “We maintain a cooperative, open and secure cyberspace, and we hope that countries around the world will make concerted efforts to that end,” he said. \\n  \\n Employers and government agencies “require us to maintain a member’s Social Security number in our systems so that their systems can uniquely identify their members,” Anthem spokeswoman Kristin Binns said. Ms. Binns said Anthem encrypts personal data when it moves in or out of its database but not when it is stored, which is common in the industry. \\n  \\n “We use other measures, including elevated user credentials, to limit access to the data when it is residing in a database,” she said. \\n  \\n ENLARGE Anthem said it is likely that ‘tens of millions’ of records were stolen. Photo: Darron Cummings/Associated Press \\n  \\n “We join you in your concern and frustration,” Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said in a letter posted on the company’s website. “I assure you that we are working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data.” He didn’t provide details. \\n  \\n Adam Greene, a privacy attorney with the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and former official in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said encryption isn’t a cure-all for data breaches. \\n  \\n “At some point, that information is going to be used in an unencrypted state and if a hacker has access to it at that point, the information could be exposed,” Mr. Greene said. \\n  \\n Last month, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law requiring health insurers operating in the state to encrypt client information, including Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, addresses and identifiable health information. The law was prompted in part by a breach of 840,000 individuals’ information from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey in 2013, following the theft of two laptops containing unencrypted data. \\n  \\n Anthem doesn’t sell plans in New Jersey. \\n  \\n Health insurers don’t always encrypt members’ data, and aren’t required by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to encrypt data. \\n  \\n Under HIPAA, doctors, hospitals, health plans and others must “address” encryption in their operations, but don’t have to scramble data if they determine doing so would impose an unreasonable burden, the likelihood of disclosure is low and they have implemented alternative security measures. \\n  \\n Mr. Greene, the privacy attorney, said repeated breaches show that the risk of disclosure isn’t low. \\n  \\n Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, which enforces HIPAA, is urging providers and insurers to encrypt as much data as possible. The office didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday. \\n  \\n The office has imposed penalties or reached settlements in 24 data-breach cases in recent years, including two in April 2014 involving lack of encryption. Concentra Health Services unit of Humana Inc. HUM -0.77 % agreed to pay $1.7 million after an unencrypted laptop was stolen from one of its facilities. The same month, QCA Health Plan Inc. of Arkansas agreed to pay $250,000 to settle potential HIPAA violations after an unencrypted laptop containing information on 148 individuals was stolen. \\n  \\n HHS’s Office for Civil Rights said at the time: “Our message to these organizations is simple: encryption is your best defense against these incidents.” \\n  \\n Write to Danny Yadron at danny.yadron@wsj.com ||||| Anthem has reached a settlement to completely resolve the multidistrict class action litigation brought against Anthem and other defendants relating to the 2015 cyber attack.

Hackers broke into the company's database storing information for about 80 million people in an attack bound to stoke fears many Americans have about the privacy of their most sensitive information. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (Photo: Michael Conroy, AP) \\n  \\n Security experts knew it was not a matter of whether a major breach would occur in the health-care industry, but when. And they knew it could entail reams of valuable personal data. \\n  \\n Health insurer Anthem Inc. on Thursday attempted to calm fears after announcing late Wednesday that as many as 80 million current and former policy holders may have had their personal information stolen in what is thought to be the largest health-care data breach to date. \\n  \\n While the company said no personal medical data or credit card information had been compromised, the type of information stolen in the breach — including names, birth dates, social security numbers, addresses, member IDs — could represent a treasure trove to cyber-thieves, experts said. \\n  \\n The company, government officials, and privacy experts urged consumers to take steps to protect themselves: Such steps include signing up for free identity theft protection Anthem is offering and remaining vigilant about their financial and insurance information. \\n  \\n \\"The general direction we are giving people is, if you have one of those cards, assume you were probably in the data set,\\" said Thomas Miller, Anthem's chief information officer. \\"At least you know that this compromise has happened. ... We will let you know as soon as we know more.\\" \\n  \\n At this point, it is too early to tell how many people were affected and just who were victims of the breach, Miller said. Nor does Anthem know how far back the records go, though the pool likely includes people now deceased. \\n  \\n 'Mass victimization' \\n  \\n \\"This is absolutely the worst kind of data breach, because thieves have stolen the information that's the most valuable, the most dangerous and impossible to change or cancel,\\" said Neal O'Farrell, Credit Sesame's security and identity theft expert in an email. \\"This is mass victimization of the worst kind.\\" \\n  \\n A website Anthem set up to answer questions and concerns, www.anthemfacts.com, had received more than 265,000 hits by the middle of the day on Thursday. \\n  \\n And an Indianapolis lawyer filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the nation's second-largest insurer, after fielding numerous calls from irate policy holders. \\n  \\n \\"Anthem needs to get its act together. It needs to protect people's data and it needs to provide whatever remedies are allowed by law,\\" said attorney Irwin Levin of the firm Cohen & Malad. \\n  \\n But Anthem officials said that they have gone above and beyond in letting people know about the breach. Other companies could have spent months gathering information before going public with the news that information may have been stolen. Instead, Anthem went public within a week of learning about rogue activity in the company's computer system, Miller said. \\n  \\n Bloomberg News reported Thursday that Chinese hackers may have been behind the theft. \\n  \\n The company had extensive plans in place to protect its information, Miller added. In the past four years, Anthem has doubled the amount of money it spends on cyber-security. The company has almost 200 security specialists on staff. \\n  \\n \\"The industry is certainly a target and we know that,\\" Miller said. \\"You always sit there, wondering could we have done anything different. Our security capabilities are certainly on par with the industry, if not better.\\" \\n  \\n Casualty of doing business \\n  \\n Privacy expert Rick Kam, president and co-founder of the Portland, Ore.-based company ID Experts, agreed that there's only so much companies like Anthem can do to protect their data. Security breaches are just part of doing business, he said, just like toxic and hazardous waste is an unpleasant byproduct of the Industrial Age. \\n  \\n \\"It's just the age we live in; there's information everywhere,\\" Kam said. \\"So, all of us just have to be more vigilant.\\" \\n  \\n Others, however, say the onus lies on the industry to ensure that the precious personal information required to access health care is adequately protected. \\n  \\n The widespread adoption of electronic health records in recent years has, if anything, increased the potential for misuse of that data. \\n  \\n Last August, Community Health Systems, a Tennessee-based hospital chain, announced that Chinese hackers had stolen non-medical data from 4.5 million patients. In 2010, Wellpoint, which had been bought by Anthem in 2004, announced that the credit card information and medical records of about half a million policy holders had been stolen. \\n  \\n A PriceWaterhouseCoopers study found information security incidents rose by 60 percent in the health-care industry in 2014. \\n  \\n Numerous tools exist that companies can deploy and this episode brings home the need for better protective measures, said Benn Konsynski, George S. Craft professor of information systems and operations management at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. \\n  \\n \\"The scale is enormous. I am sort of bewildered that we still have this magnitude of exposure,\\" he said. \\"It certainly is the third or the fourth wake-up call to the market. ... (It) is incumbent on firms like that to go the extra mile to make sure that exposure is prevented or minimized in those processes.\\" \\n  \\n Long-term ill effects \\n  \\n The type of information that the hackers have accessed could create problems for those affected for years to come, experts say. \\n  \\n Such information can be sold on the black market to open the door to a range of identity theft schemes. For instance, criminals have all the information they need to submit fraudulent tax returns, Kam said. Victims might not realize they have been affected until they try to process their returns. \\n  \\n Or, a person could use the information to engage in medical identity fraud, said Ann Patterson, senior vice president and program director of the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance. Consumers need to carefully review all explanations of benefits they received from insurers to make sure that they have not been the victim of medical identity theft. \\n  \\n Medical identity theft could inadvertently result in harm to the victim, Patterson added. For instance, if the perpetrator does not share the same blood type as the victim, a person could receive a dangerous transfusion. \\n  \\n And unlike credit card fraud, this episode may affect not just individuals but entire families. \\n  \\n Greenwood resident John Sickmeier takes pains not to give out his or his five children's Social Security numbers. Whenever asked for this data on a form, he jots down a note, \\"Call for number.\\" That way, he said, he restricts how many people have access to this information. \\n  \\n The Anthem breach, which could include his children's Social Security numbers, could haunt them for years to come, he said. \\n  \\n \\"What was stolen was far more threatening and egregious. It's everything that a thief would need to steal one's identity,\\" Sickmeier said. \\"This could very well be a lifelong battle either for myself or any of my children.\\" \\n  \\n Star reporter Tim Evans contributed to this report. \\n  \\n Call Star reporter Shari Rudavsky at (317) 444-6354.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \\n  \\n / Updated \\n  \\n Health insurer Anthem is offering free credit monitoring after a major breach that may have affected as many as 80 million records, but customers should watch out for an especially insidious type of fraud: medical identity theft. \\n  \\n Anthem disclosed the hack late Wednesday, saying customer information that could have been compromised includes names, Social Security numbers, street addresses -- and the medical ID numbers found on customers' health insurance cards. \\n  \\n Criminals can use those numbers at hospitals, emergency rooms and pharmacies to receive care and prescriptions, racking up charges and wrecking victims' medical records. (No health data or financial information was included in the breach, the company said.) \\n  \\n \\"It's like an unlimited credit card that gets you 'free' access to expensive services and drugs,\\" said Bob Gregg, CEO of ID Experts, which provides breach-response services to major U.S. companies. \\"Everyone thinks about credit cards and bank accounts, but medical identity theft can be much more damaging and extremely hard to fix.\\" \\n  \\n That's because any medical care a criminal receives while using a victim's ID number gets added to the victim's health record -- and may go unnoticed for months or even years. The effects \\"can be life-threatening,\\" as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services notes on its website. \\n  \\n Imagine an unwitting medical ID theft victim who is rushed to the hospital for emergency gallbladder removal, but the patient's record shows the gallbladder was removed last year. That could cause confusion for the healthcare providers and serious delays in treatment, as could incorrect information about blood types or possible drug interactions. \\n  \\n Anthem wouldn't comment specifically on the potential for medical identity theft, but vice president of communications Kristin Binns told NBC News: \\"The best advice and counsel we can give people is that if they’ve been impacted, they'll receive information through a mailing. We're offering credit monitoring for a year and we encourage people to call the number in the mailing if they have any questions.\\" \\n  \\n Read more: Anthem Breach: What Should I Do Right Now? \\n  \\n \\"I think consumers just aren't aware of this. They don’t understand how, exactly, this information can be used and why it can be so dangerous,\\" Larry Ponemon, founder of the privacy and information security research firm Ponemon Institute, told NBC News. \\n  \\n Ponemon Institute's 2013 study (the most recent available) about medical ID theft estimated that about 1.84 million adult Americans or close family members had at some point been victims of medical identity theft -- up from 1.52 million the previous year. More than one-third of victims said they incurred out-of-pocket costs, which averaged nearly $19,000 per person. \\n  \\n Medical ID numbers sold online can fetch $20-$100 each versus just $1-$5 for financial information, said Gregg, the ID Experts CEO. Some physicians have begun asking for photo ID, but the practice isn't widespread and \\"anyone who can get access to your medical ID number can probably fake a license pretty quickly,\\" he said. \\n  \\n Untangling wrecked medical records can be an arduous process even for the experts, as privacy laws protect the release of health information and it can be tough for victims to prove they're not the ones who actually received treatment. Some victims end up paying the fraudulent bills to resolve the situation after months of frustration, Ponemon said. \\n  \\n Protect yourself \\n  \\n Consumers can take steps to protect themselves, said Gregg, whose company offers a medical identity protection program. Both Ponemon and Gregg agreed the best way consumers can catch fraudulent medical services is by checking every Explanation of Benefits (EOB): the statements insurers send after a customer receives treatment. \\n  \\n Check credit reports to be sure there are no odd medical bills listed, and contact the insurer immediately if a charge looks unfamiliar. Upon request, health insurers will also provide a list of benefits paid out in a customer's name each year. \\n  \\n Other tips focus on the common sense and caution that should be applied when handling any sensitive information: Shred medical documents before throwing them out, report lost ID cards and don't give your medical ID number to anyone who may not have your best interests at heart. But those suggestions won't stop ID numbers from being stolen when the insurers themselves are breached. \\n  \\n \\"If 2014 was the year of the data breach, we're expecting 2015 to be the year of the medical data breach,\\" Gregg said. \\"Unfortunately, I think Anthem is going to be the first of many.\\" |||||","response":"Anthem, a big health insurance company, had a lot of important information about their customers, like their names, birthdays, and social security numbers.

Trevor Gibbon, 48, of Harrow, north west London, was remanded in custody when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates' Court this morning. He is accused of killing his neighbour, Alison Morrison, who died half a mile from her Harrow home as she made her way to work on Thursday morning. Residents reported hearing piercing screams and police were called to the attack in Alexandra Avenue at 7.47am. Mrs Morrison was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died from her injuries. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple stab wounds. Gibbon, satellite TV engineer, held on to glass at the front of the dock and looked around the court during today's brief hearing. Magistrate Caroline Whycer told him he was being remanded in custody to stand trial at the Old Bailey, where there will be a bail hearing on Tuesday, followed by a preliminary hearing on January 12. Tributes have been pouring in for Mrs Morrision, who has been described as a 'wonderful and caring' mother and wife who worked hard to reduce crime in her community. Her three sisters, Julie, Paula and Lorraine, have left from their homes in Waterlooville, Hampshire, to comfort her grieving husband Cedric and their 16-year-old son Kori in Harrow. Her sister Julie had been due to stay at their £410,000 end-of-terrace house after visiting the Olympia Horse Show in London this weekend. Mrs Morrison, a mother of one, grew up in Bedhampton, Hampshire, before moving to the capital after finishing university. She was planning to return home to see her family to celebrate Christmas next week. Her brother-in-law, Lee Richards, said her 46-year-old husband called the family to tell them the tragic news. He said: 'We are in shock. It couldn't have happened to a nicer lady. 'You know what sisters are like - you can't separate them. 'They received a phone call from Cedric to say there had been a situation. 'They left what they were doing and went straight up there.' The much-loved mother died from multiple stab wounds after being attacked in Harrow, London, on Thursday. Gibbon, 48,  was remanded in custody when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates' Court (pictured) this morning. Mrs Morrison's sister Paula received the news after stepping off the plane at London Heathrow airport following a 10-day holiday in Cuba. Mr Richards said his wife Julie Brathwaite, a 52-year-old mother-of-two who runs a cleaning business, was inconsolable. He said: 'She's in a mess. I have left the sisters together - that's the best way. 'Alison was here a couple of weeks ago. My family were due to go up this weekend to the Olympia horse show. 'They were going to stay at Alison's home. 'A couple of years ago they lost their dad. 'It's taken them this long to get over that and now this has happened.' Her mother, Valerie Brathwaite, who still lives in the family home in Hampshire was too upset to speak yesterday. But Mr Richards described Mrs Morrison as a 'wonderful, caring mother' to her teenage son Kori. He said she died a lot of voluntary work for her community, and was the vice-chairwoman of her local Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Tributes for the 'wonderful and caring' mother of one have been left at the scene of her death in Harrow. One tribute left at the scene, from one of her sisters, said: 'I'm so sorry you've been taken away from us all' Her full-time job was as a senior manager at consumer organisation Which?, a position she moved to London for after studying a degree. He said: 'She was fun-loving and happy. She was sensible and responsible - this is a disaster.' Bianca Brathwaite, 24, Mrs Morrison's niece, added: 'She was everything you could ask for in a woman, she was strong and always stood up for herself and her family and is loved dearly.' David Perry, leader of Harrow Council, described her as a 'key member of the board'. He said: 'Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a community champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about. 'Alison's colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news, as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the board and a tireless advocate of its work. 'We will do whatever we can to help the police. In the meantime, our thoughts are with Alison's family.' Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens, borough commander for Harrow, said: 'I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Alison in her role as the vice-chair of our borough's Safer Neighbourhood Board. 'She was held in high regard locally, and truly cared about the borough. Her friends within the local community will be devastated by her loss.'

Below is a comprehensive list of some of the most common and popular slang terms for a prison in the United States:\\n\\n1.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Are they legal for the public to possess in the state of Alaska?\\nWhat are tracer rounds? Are they legal for the public to possess in the state of Arizona?","response":"No, the following two questions are not the same. They share a common subject regarding tracer rounds; however, they inquire about the legality of possession by the public in two different states: Alaska and Arizona. Let's discuss both questions individually.\\n\\n1. What are tracer rounds? Are they legal for the public to possess in the state of Alaska?\\n\\nTracer rounds, sometimes referred to as tracer ammunition, are projectiles engineered with a small pyrotechnic charge built into their base. This charge ignites and produces a visible trace when fired, allowing the shooter to effortlessly observe the bullet's trajectory to adjust their aim for greater accuracy. Tracer rounds are commonly employed by military personnel, particularly in low-light conditions or when engaging in rapid-fire situations.\\n\\nAs for the legality of possessing tracer rounds in the state of Alaska, the Alaska State Legislature generally does not place specific restrictions on conventional ammunition, including tracers, for public possession. However, it is essential to keep in mind that federal law in the United States does regulate the sale and possession of some types of ammunition. Under the National Firearms Act, individuals must obtain proper authorization to possess certain types of ammunition, including armor-piercing rounds and explosive projectiles. Nevertheless, tracer rounds are typically not subject to these limitations, so they are generally legal to possess in Alaska. Local laws and regulations can vary, so it is always advisable to consult with local authorities before possessing or using tracer rounds.\\n\\n2. What are tracer rounds? Are they legal for the public to possess in the state of Arizona?\\n\\nThe definition of tracer rounds remains the same as described above: projectiles containing a small pyrotechnic charge used to observe the bullet's trajectory in low-light conditions or rapid-fire scenarios, primarily by military personnel.\\n\\nAs for the legality of possessing tracer rounds in the state of Arizona, the state has relatively lenient gun laws and does not place specific restrictions on the public's possession of tracer rounds. The federal law regarding ammunition still applies, meaning that certain types of ammunition, such as armor-piercing rounds and explosive projectiles, are subject to restrictions under the National Firearms Act. However, tracer rounds are not typically included in these restrictions, making them generally legal for the public to possess in Arizona. As always, it is wise to consult local authorities before obtaining or using tracer rounds, as local laws and regulations can differ.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although both questions cover the subject of tracer rounds, they request information regarding their legality in two distinct states: Alaska and Arizona."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.\\nA text is given in Telugu.

Movie title: The Three Musketeers Context: Callow youth D'Artagnan (Walter Abel) sets off from Gascony for Paris, armed with his father's sword, an old horse and a letter of introduction to his godfather, Captain de Treville (Lumsden Hare), commander of the King's Musketeers. Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well.

Information that was once under lock and key of real estate agents is now freely available to anyone with Internet access.\\n\\nHome buyers can receive a smartphone alert the minute a new listing hits the market in their search area. Home owners can closely monitor neighborhood trends to see how quickly homes are selling and estimate how their home’s value may be evolving over time.\\n\\nAccessing data has never been easier, which has empowered consumers and enabled them to better educate themselves. The challenge for people today is not accessing information, but instead sifting through everything that is available and correctly interpreting that information. So in the world of big data, what data is the most useful? Below I’ve outlined the statistics that are the most insightful as well as some data that can be misleading and easily misinterpreted.\\n\\nThe No. 1 question realtors are asked is “how’s the market?” If you’d like to find out for yourself, the statistics I recommend are months of supply, sale-to-list ratio and median days on market.\\n\\n• Months of supply is a calculation of how many months it would take for all of the current homes on the market to sell if no new homes came on the market. It shows us how inventory relates to demand and is a key indicator of whether buyers or sellers have the upper hand in the current market. Four to five months of supply is average. If the number is smaller, this is an indication of a sellers’ market: There are relatively few sellers with more buyers competing over available homes. The higher the number, the more buyers are favored in the market — meaning there are lots of homes to choose from, and buyers have more negotiating power.\\n\\n[Drilling down on neighborhood data can help in buying or selling in a hot area]\\n\\nYou can calculate the current months of supply by dividing the total number of homes for sale by the number of homes sold in one month. You can find this data on numerous Web sites, including Redfin.com. For example, consider you are exploring the market conditions in Cleveland Park for single-family homes. Set your search for active listings in Cleveland Park and narrow it by single-family homes.\\n\\nLet’s say you find there are currently four single-family homes for sale. Now adjust your search to sold homes in the past month, filtered for just single-family homes. Three single-family homes sold in the past month. Quick calculation of four divided by three, means that there are only 1.3 months of supply for single-family homes right now. If you are thinking about selling your Cleveland Park home, now would be a smart time. If you are looking to buy in the neighborhood, prepare yourself for some stiff competition.\\n\\nI also recommend calculating the rate of sales over a longer period. In Cleveland Park, 34 single-family homes sold over the past year. Dividing 34 by 12 months tells you that homes are selling at an average rate of 2.83 per month. Take the four homes that are for sale now and divide by 2.83 sales rate for the past year and you’ll get 1.4 months of supply – not far off from the 1.3 months of supply when just looking at the past month. This shows you that 1.3 is not an anomaly. Inventory has been tight for the past 12 months, and the market for buyers may be getting even more competitive.\\n\\nYou can calculate months of supply based on your personal search criteria, such as condos between $400,000 and $500,000 within a specific Zip code. This will give you an understanding of the current amount of inventory and level of competition for the homes you are interested in.\\n\\n• Sale-to-list ratio looks at how the price the buyer paid for a home compares with the price the home was listed for. If it’s above 100 percent, the home sold for more than the list price and below 100 percent, the home sold for less than the list price. Looking at sale-to-list percentages can help buyers and sellers get a sense of how to negotiate on pricing. To calculate the average sale-to-list for a group of homes, add up each home’s sale-to-list ratio, then take the average of the total. A home with a high sale-to-list ratio may have had the price escalate in a bidding war. In some cases, the seller may have strategically decided to price below market value to draw buyers in and create a bidding war.\\n\\n• Median days on market is a quick and helpful figure for determining the speed of the market. It is the length of time that homes were on the market before going under contract with a buyer. Redfin provides this data every month as part of our national market tracker report. If you have trouble finding this statistic, your agent should be able to provide the median days on market for the area you are looking in.\\n\\nWhen evaluating the estimated value of a property — either your own or one you’re considering purchasing — beware of relying too heavily on tax assessments, computer-generated estimates and price per square foot calculations.\\n\\n• The county tax assessment should not be equated with market value of a property. There are many reasons that the assessment may be inaccurate. County assessors typically do not enter the home and rely on the public records and an exterior visual review to make a general estimate of value. They do not often reassess the property each year. The county records for the home may be incomplete or outdated. Assessments are not always updated in a timely manner to take account of renovation and additions.\\n\\n• Computer-generated estimates and valuations are often off-base, yet many potential buyers and sellers treat estimates like the “Zestimate” as a hard appraisal of market value. Computer algorithms can crunch numbers and churn out an estimate, but they lack the ability to weigh all the factors that can significantly influence valuation, including a home’s curb appeal and charm, view, location and school district. Post Real Estate columnist Kenneth R. Harney’s article earlier this year on Zestimates explored this topic in detail. While it’s fine to use these types of valuations as a starting point, keep the margin of error and in mind.\\n\\n[How accurate is Zillow’s Zestimate? Not very, says one Washington-area agent]\\n\\n[How accurate is Zillow’s Zestimate? Zillow says the tool is helpful when used the right way.]\\n\\n• Price per square foot is another factor that can vary significantly and should be taken with a grain of salt. Two similar homes can have quite different price/square foot, and some buyers put too much weight in the calculation when determining an asking price. There are two reasons this is a dangerous strategy. First, square footage can be inaccurate. Basements and rooms that are below grade are not counted in total square footage. A home with a nicely finished basement may have a high price/square foot because the list price reflects the usable basement space, but the basement’s square footage is not included in the calculation.\\n\\nSimilarly, a home with high-end finishes, a stunning roof deck, parking or a stellar location will have a higher price/square foot than a home without these features. Price per square foot is typically the most helpful for condo buildings or newer builds in which the age, layout and features of the units are similar.\\n\\nFinally, agents can share a lot of information and data about the local housing market, but keep in mind that there are a few areas that we are prohibited by law from discussing, including area schools, demographics and crime. But just because your agent cannot discuss these factors does not mean that you might not find this information important in your home search. There are a lot of great resources to help consumers assess the external factors of a neighborhood.\\n\\nGreatSchools.org provides rankings of both public and private schools. CrimeReports.com is a great resource that provides a map of reported crimes. Users can search a specific address and see the crimes that have been reported in the vicinity. People have different thresholds for crime and community safety, and this puts the information in your hands to make the decision that works for you.\\n\\nWalkScore.com assesses neighborhoods and properties based on walkability and the proximity of amenities, such as grocery stores, restaurants, parks and other services. If it’s important to you to live in a walkable community, this is a great resource. WalkScore also provides Transit Scores and Bike Scores that make it easy to see how car dependent is an area vs. the accessibility of alternative transportation options.\\n\\nThanks to the plethora of resources and data available online, it’s never been easier to become a real estate market expert. Armed with the right data, you can better prepare yourself to buy or sell and feel more confident about your decisions. And remember that agents are available to help you interpret the trends, guide you and answer any questions along the way.\\n\\nCatch up on Marshall’s previous columns:\\n\\nFive real estate myths that snag buyers and sellers\\n\\nHome buyers’ top five regrets\\n\\nWant to buy a flipped home?

Who was James I and why don't we know where he's buried? \\n  \\n James I of Scotland was a complex and colourful king. \\n  \\n He was a poet, a sportsman, a musician and a patron of architects. \\n  \\n He survived being kidnapped by pirates when he was just 12 years old - and the following 18 years he spent as a hostage to the Lancastrian kings of England. \\n  \\n In 1424, he made a triumphant return to Scotland and was crowned at Scone, but 13 years later he was brutally stabbed to death, his body dumped in the sewer below the Blackfriars monastery in Perth. \\n  \\n Young prince in danger \\n  \\n James Stewart was born in 1394, the third son of King Robert III and Annabella Drummond. \\n  \\n By the time he was eight years old, he was their only surviving son. \\n  \\n His brother Robert died in infancy and his other brother David, the Duke of Rothesay, died in suspicious circumstances at Falkland Castle while he was being detained by his uncle Robert, the Duke of Albany. \\n  \\n After David's death, James was the heir to the Scottish throne, but he was also an impediment to the royal line being transferred to the Albany Stewarts. \\n  \\n Fears grew for his safety and plans were made to send him to France. \\n  \\n In March 1406, he boarded a boat bound for France, but just days into the voyage, the vessel was intercepted in the English Channel by pirates who delivered him to Henry IV of England. \\n  \\n Eighteen years a hostage \\n  \\n On 4 April 1406, Robert III died and the 12-year-old James was now the uncrowned King of Scots. But he was imprisoned in England and his uncle, the Duke of Albany, became regent in Scotland. \\n  \\n James may have been a prisoner, but he was allowed to keep a small household and was treated well by Henry IV. \\n  \\n This lasted until 1413 when Henry IV died, his son Henry V became king, and James was transferred to the Tower of London with other Scottish prisoners. \\n  \\n It took another seven years before James' standing improved enough for him to be regarded more of a guest than a hostage - but it took a third change of monarch in England before James was finally allowed back to Scotland. \\n  \\n Henry V died in 1422, and the regency council for the infant Henry VI were eager to organise his release as soon as possible. \\n  \\n Despite opposition from the Albany Stewarts, it was arranged for 1424 when he arrived triumphantly in Edinburgh on Palm Sunday, accompanied by his newly-wed English wife, Joan Beaufort. \\n  \\n Coronation and assassination \\n  \\n James I was crowned King of Scotland at Scone on 21 May 1424. \\n  \\n Prominent members of the Albany Stewarts were found guilty of rebellion and executed, but a conspiracy against the King began to grow and he reigned for just 13 years before his death. \\n  \\n On 4 February 1437, the King and Queen were in their royal apartments at the Blackfriars monastery in Perth, when a group of about 30 people was let in by one of the conspirators against him. \\n  \\n James I was alerted and had enough time to hide in a sewer tunnel, but his exit was blocked and he was trapped and killed. \\n  \\n He died in a pool of his own blood, stabbed dozens of times. \\n  \\n The assassin, Sir Robert Graham, is said to have screamed after his death: \\"I have thus slayne and delivered yow of so crewel a tyrant, the grettest enemye that Scottes or Scotland might have.\\" \\n  \\n James I was buried within the grounds of Perth Charterhouse, but the priory was destroyed in the reformation a century after his death and now no-one is exactly sure where his grave is. \\n  \\n A stone monument at the corner of Perth's King Street and Hospital Street marks the fact he is buried somewhere in the area. \\n  \\n Discovering the murdered King's exact location would be a major historical find -

Article: I still remember--my hands and my fingers still remember--what used to lie in store for us on our return to school from the holidays. The trees in the school yard would be in full leaf again and the old leaves would be lying around like a muddy sea of leaves. \\"Get that all swept up!\\" the headmaster would tell us. \\"I want the whole place cleaned up, at once!\\" There was enough work there, to last over a week. Especially since the only tools with which we were provided were our hands, our fingers, and our nails. \\"Now see that it's done properly, and be quick about it,\\" the headmaster would say to the older pupils, \\"or you'll have to answer for it!\\" So at an order from the older boys we would all line up like peanuts about to cut and gather in crops. If the work was not going as quickly as the headmaster expected, the big boys, instead of giving us a helping hand, used to find it simpler to beat us with branches pulled from the trees. In order to avoid these blows , we used to bribe  the older boys with the juicy cakes we used to bring for our midday meals. And if we happened to have any money on us, the coins changed hands at once. If we did not do this, if we were afraid of going home with an empty stomach or an empty purse, the blows were redoubled. They hit us so violently and with such evil enjoyment that even a deaf and dumb person would have realized that we were being whipped  not so much to make us work harder, but rather to beat us into a state of obedience  in which we would be only too glad to give up our food and money. Occasionally one of us, worn out by such calculated cruelty, would have the courage to complain to the headmaster. He would of course be very angry, but the punishment he gave the older boys was always very small--nothing compared to what they had done to us.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"?\\nA:","response":"Question: According to the passage, what are the reasons and potential benefits for Jehovah's Witnesses to practice shunning, and what are the different forms of discipline that can be administered by congregation elders?"},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Simon plays in a band and dreams of one day getting paid to write music.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Scratch Orchestra was an experimental musical ensemble founded in the spring of 1969 by Cornelius Cardew, Michael Parsons and Howard Skempton.  - Philip Dadson is a New Zealand musician and artist , who was in the foundation group for the Scratch Orchestra and founder of From Scratch .

The school is located across three buildings, the Mondrian building, Building 431 (or the \\"Main\\" fine arts building), and Elam B, which includes the studios for postgraduate and doctoral students on Princes Street, in central Auckland, New Zealand.  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - The University of Auckland is the largest university in New Zealand, located in the country's largest city, Auckland. It is the highest-ranked university in the country, being ranked 81st worldwide in the 2016/17 QS World University Rankings.

The diameter   of Venus is about 7,520 miles (12,100km), about 400 miles (644km) smaller than that of the earth. No other planet comes closer to the earth than Venus. At its nearest approach it is about 25,000,000 miles (402,000,000km) away. As seen from the earth, Venus is the first planet or star that can be seen in the western sky in the evening. At other times, it is the last planet or star that can be seen in the eastern sky in the morning. When Venus is near its brightest point, it can be seen in the daylight.

Article: Every day since March 8, people all over the world keep asking the same question: Where did Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 go? It turns out to be the biggest mystery in modern aviation   history. In the early hours of March 8, a Boeing 777 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur  . It was heading to Beijing. But about two hours into the flight, the plane lost contact. There were 239 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight, including 154 Chinese. About 12 countries, including China, the US and Australia, have joined the search for the missing plane and passengers. The plane's disappearance was a \\"mystery\\", said officials. The plane was flying at a height of more than 10,000 meters when it suddenly lost contact. The weather was clear. The pilots didn't make any distress calls  . When a plane crashes, broken parts are usually recovered. But up to April 2, officials have not found anything.    People are also talking about a possible hijacking. Interpol   said that two people on the flight used stolen passports. But that information alone isn't evidence  of a hijack. The investigation   is still going on. It could take months or even years to find out what happened to the flight. \\"We are looking at all possibilities,\\" said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein. \\"The most important thing now is to find the plane.\\" On March 24 came a piece of sad news.

Everybody is looking for that edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically fit. One approach taken by many athletes is the use of amino acid supplements. The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for muscles. However, the only real benefit comes to the people who make and sell the pills. Studies have not showed any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves. You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet.  Now, I have a new situation: A big marathon is being held in Chicago this year, Many people from the area are going to participate and there is a cash prize of $10000 for the winner. A sporting goods store that specializes in amino acid supplements  begins advertising more heavily during the time coming up to the race.  Answer this question please: Given most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes, will sales at the sporting goods store increase or decrease for amino acid supplements?\\nAnswer:","response":"Based on the provided background and situation, it is likely that sales of amino acid supplements at the sporting goods store will increase during the time leading up to the marathon. This increase can be attributed to several factors.\\n\\nFirstly, the majority of the marathon participants are competitive athletes who are constantly seeking ways to improve their performance. The prevailing belief among many athletes and fitness enthusiasts is that amino acid supplements may provide an advantage in terms of enhancing endurance, muscle growth, and recovery. Although scientific studies have not consistently demonstrated a clear advantage of amino acid supplementation for athletes, consumer perceptions often drive purchasing behavior.\\n\\nSecondly, the increased advertising by the sporting goods store can also contribute to a boost in sales. Advertising is a powerful tool to persuade consumers and create awareness of a product. The store's heavy advertising campaign, targeting the growing excitement surrounding the marathon, is likely to attract the attention of potential participants and other fitness-minded consumers.\\n\\nFurthermore, the presence of a cash prize of $10,000 for the winner of the marathon can also act as an incentive for athletes and marathon enthusiasts to try every available strategy to increase their chances of winning, including the use of amino acid supplements. The allure of the prize money might push individuals to experiment with new products or strategies, even if scientific evidence regarding their efficacy is limited.\\n\\nLastly, with the marathon being held in Chicago, a densely populated urban area, the sporting goods store is likely to have a larger potential customer base. The increased visibility of the marathon in the local community will create buzz around the event and related products, further boosting sales potential.\\n\\nIn conclusion, given the competitive nature of the athletes participating in the marathon, the increased advertising efforts by the sporting goods store, and the overall excitement surrounding the event, it is reasonable to expect an increase in sales of amino acid supplements during the time leading up to the race. However, it is worth noting that individuals looking to improve their athletic performance should prioritize a healthy and balanced diet, as the actual benefits of amino acid supplementation for athletes are still inconclusive."},{"question":"How to feel drunk without drinking<br>Hit the gym or the local park.

It is important to be empathetic and understanding in such situations, and denying someone's experience could cause further harm.\\n\\nIn ACTION2, breaking up a family unit and living one's own life could be viewed as less ethical or not, depending on the context. Choosing to live independently might not necessarily be unethical; it could be a personal choice for self-growth or finding personal happiness. However, if the individual is causing harm to others or abandoning their responsibilities, then it might be considered less ethical.\\n\\nConsidering both actions, it is not possible to conclusively identify which statement is less ethical, so the answer is 'no'."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: One day, three farm boys come upon a wounded outlaw named Harry Spikes.

Ryan Gorman. PUBLISHED:. 12:58 EST, 30 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 16:21 EST, 30 August 2013. Towson University’s champion cheerleaders have been suspended for hazing. The Baltimore school’s cheerleading squad has been suspended for a recent hazing incident that the school has not yet disclosed. An investigation into the matter has been completed, but an appeal is still on-going, Gay Pinder, media relations, told MailOnline. The university first learned of the allegations Aug. 6. A total of 10 incoming freshman co-eds were hazed, Ms Pinder told MailOnline, adding that they went unharmed. No title defense: Despite an automatic place in the next cheer championships, in 2014, it appears unlikely the team will defend its title. The team has been suspended for the entire 2013-2014 academic year, according to Ms. Pinder. First enacted while the university looked into the allegations, the punishment stood after the investigation was completed. The suspension was first reported by the university’s student newspaper The Torchlight. ‘Towson has a policy of no hazing and we do take that very seriously, said Ms. Pinder, ‘we have high expectations of our students and expect them to treat each other with the utmost respect.’ The school has not yet released the details surrounding exactly how the students were hazed, and Ms Pinder declined to provide those details to MailOnline. Champions: The squad won the most recent Division I cheer championships, earning an automatic bid in next year's tournament. Banned: Towson University's cheerleading team has been suspended following allegations of hazing. It is not clear if this is the first incident of hazing involving the cheer team, according to Ms Pinder.While sports teams have usually been in the hazing spotlight, pep squads have been outed as hazers as well. A drum major at Florida A&M University died after a 2011 hazing incident during which he was beaten by several members of the school band. ‘I have never heard of a whole team getting suspended,’ Jim Lord, executive director of the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators told the Baltimore Sun. ‘That is pretty rare, maybe unheard of,’ he added. In April, Towson’s cheerleaders placed first in the All-Girl Division I section of the National Cheerleaders Association's Collegiate Cheerleading Championship. Their win proffered them an automatic spot in the 2014 competition, one they look unlikely to attend.\\nHere is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Towson University's champion cheerleading squad was suspended for the 2013-2014 academic year due to a hazing incident involving 10 incoming freshmen co-eds.

Question:   When Dave screams outside he notices that the sound travels at different speeds in different temperatures. The sound travels faster when it is cold. or hot?    Paragraph :  For a given medium, sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures.\\nAnswer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, when Dave screams outside and notices that the sound travels at different speeds in different temperatures, it is observed that the sound travels faster in hot temperatures rather than cold temperatures. The paragraph states that \\"for a given medium, sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures.\\" This implies that in colder temperatures, the speed at which sound travels is slower, meaning that sound waves move more quickly in warmer temperatures.\\n\\nThis variation in the speed of sound occurs due to the changes in the properties of the medium (such as air) through which the sound waves are travelling. Warmer air has more energy which allows the air molecules to move more freely and quickly, thus facilitating the rapid transmission of sound. Conversely, colder air has less energy, causing the air molecules to move sluggishly, which slows down the speed of sound.\\n\\nIn essence, when Dave screams outside and observes the sound travelling at different speeds in varying temperatures, the sound travels faster in hot temperatures as opposed to cold temperatures, as stated in the provided paragraph."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Sasha would no longer be able to compete after breaking her leg.  Given the context: How would you describe Sasha?  Possible answers: hurt that she couldn't compete, hindered, sad that she couldn't compete\\nA:","response":"Sasha can be described as experiencing a range of emotions and facing physical limitations as a result of her unfortunate situation. Firstly, she could be feeling hurt that she couldn't compete. Breaking her leg must have been a traumatic experience that could result in disappointment and frustration, as it is preventing her from participating in a competition she might have been looking forward to and prepared herself for. Sasha could have worked tirelessly and shown dedication to be ready for the competition, but now is forced to miss out on the opportunity.\\n\\nSecondly, Sasha can be perceived as hindered by her broken leg. This physical limitation potentially impacts not only her ability to compete but also her everyday activities and routines. Sasha's freedom of movement and independence may be compromised as she adjusts to mobility aids, medical treatment, and the process of healing and rehabilitation. Delays and setbacks in reaching her goals might add to her feelings of being hindered.\\n\\nLastly, it is entirely possible that Sasha feels sad that she couldn't compete. The emotional toll of being unable to participate in an event she was passionate about could result in feelings of sadness and perhaps even a sense of loss. Missing out on the competition might make Sasha question her self-worth and abilities as an athlete or competitor. As she navigates her journey in recovery, Sasha might feel disheartened and struggle to maintain her spirits.\\n\\nIn conclusion, describing Sasha as hurt that she couldn't compete, hindered, and sad that she couldn't compete accurately portrays the physical, emotional, and psychological challenges she faces in light of breaking her leg. These descriptions acknowledge the multi-faceted impact of her injury on her ability to participate in the competition and her overall wellbeing."},{"question":"Dialogue:\\nEdi: So?\\nAnnabelle: I got pissed off!\\nEdi: I believe so!

Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter. High-speed debris from the Russian satellite strikes the Explorer and Hubble, detaching Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), recovers Stone and they return to the Explorer. They discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. They decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450Â km (900Â mi) away.

There are several men involved, creating a chaotic environment with continuous movement and action.\\n2. The character in focus (presumably a female) is engaged in some form of conflict with the mentioned Stick.\\n3. The Stick is already wounded before the character intervenes.\\n4. The female character successfully pins the knife-wielding hand of the Stick.\\n5. The female character proceeds to cut deep into the Stick's neck, presumably inflicting a critical or fatal wound.\\n\\nNow let's analyze the hypothesis:\\n\\"The Stick had the upper hand.\\"\\n\\nThe hypothesis suggests that the Stick was in a dominant or advantageous position during the conflict, either generally or at a specific point in time. To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, we must investigate whether the presented events align with this notion.\\n\\nBased on the premise, it can be argued that the Stick may have initially held an advantageous position due to it being a chaotic environment with other men involved. However, the Stick is also described as wounded even before the female character intervenes, indicating that the hypothesis' claim of supremacy might not hold true.\\n\\nAdditionally, the female character successfully pins the weapon-wielding hand of the Stick and causes a severe or lethal injury by cutting its neck. This strongly suggests that the Stick loses the upper hand in the conflict, contrary to the hypothesis.\\n\\nThus, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well.

Inhalation through the nose or mouth: Breathing begins when air is drawn into the body through the nose or mouth. This is the very first step, as it initiates the process of delivering and exchanging gases needed for respiration. Without this first step, air cannot enter the bronchioles.\\n2. Air enters bronchioles: The inhaled air travels down the trachea and into the bronchi, which eventually lead to the bronchioles.\\n3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: These small air sacs facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs.\\n4. Alveoli are surrounded by small blood vessels: These vessels, known as capillaries, enable gas exchange.\\n5. Oxygen is absorbed by small blood vessels: The oxygen in the air diffuses into the capillaries for transport throughout the body.\\n6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: Oxygenated blood is circulated throughout the body, providing cells with the oxygen they need to produce energy.\\n7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to the lungs: As cells produce energy, they also create carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct. This carbon dioxide is transported back to the lungs by the blood.\\n8. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: As you breathe out, the carbon dioxide that has been brought back to the lungs is expelled from the body.\\n\\nThe process outlined is for the exchange of gases during respiration, and the missing first step, inhalation through the nose or mouth, is essential for initiating this process."},{"question":"24 November 2015 Last updated at 06:48 GMT\\nHer dad decided to do something about it.\\nHe created a comic starring Emily as a superhero called, \\"The Department of Ability\\".\\nRicky went to meet the girl behind the superhero mask.\\nWhat is a summary of this text?","response":"On the 24th of November 2015, an inspiring story was shared about a father who took matters into his own hands to give his daughter, Emily, a unique and empowering experience.

The premise directly contradicts the hypothesis, suggesting that March is known for strong, rather than calm, winds.\\n\\nTo understand the reasoning behind this discrepancy, it's helpful to have some background information on why March is generally associated with high winds. There are several meteorological factors contributing to this weather phenomenon. Here are some of the prominent factors that lead to higher winds in certain regions during March:\\n\\n1. Jet stream: The jet stream is a strong, high-altitude air current that separates cold, dense air from warm, lighter air, and strongly influences weather patterns. During the transition from winter to spring, the jet stream begins to shift northward. This movement creates an increased temperature gradient, leading to more vigorous storms and stronger winds in certain regions.\\n\\n2. Temperature differences: As the Earth moves through its orbit, the tilt of its axis causes seasonal changes in the amount of sunlight received by each hemisphere. As the Northern Hemisphere warms up during the transition from winter to spring, there is a larger temperature difference between polar and equatorial regions. This temperature difference amplifies the pressure gradient between high and low-pressure systems, leading to increased wind speeds.\\n\\n3. Seasonal storm systems: During March, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, the atmosphere becomes more dynamic, with stronger, more potent storm systems developing. This increased storm activity results in more frequent and stronger wind events. These systems are fueled by the temperature contrast between the cold, retreating winter air and the increasingly warm, advancing spring air.\\n\\nTaking these factors into consideration, it can be said that the premise \\"March is the month for high winds\\" is supported by meteorological evidence and weather patterns. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"The winds are calm in March\\" would not be considered true based on the premise provided. It is important to note, though, that weather patterns can vary between geographical locations and from year to year, so there may be instances where March is relatively calm in some places. However, in general, March tends to see heightened wind activity, making the hypothesis unlikely to be considered true."},{"question":"Article: Many songs, poems, and books have been written on love's strong effect on people. The state of being in love has even been compared to being sick or mad. A study by Professor Semir Zeki of University College London has found that love does affect people's brains by making them feel great. Zeki studied young men and women who had recently fallen in love. He found that, when they were looking at photos of their loved ones, there was heightened activity in four areas of their brains. These areas deal with emotions, and one of them, in particular, is known to respond to drugs that cause feelings of great joy and excitement. Interestingly, the study also found a lack of activity in two other areas of the brain when the volunteers looked at their lovers' photographs. One of these areas is linked to feelings of sadness, while the other is often active in people suffering from depression. It seems love really can be _ . The state of being in love, according to some scientists, may actually be good for your health. Although scientists know that being in love can make a person feel great, the exact influence of love on a person's health is harder to determine. However, scientists say that people do need love in order to live healthy lives. According to Dr. Thomas Lewis, people need to be in relationships because that is how we are designed. He says the brain can only maintain  the overall stability of a person's immune  system, bodily rhythms, and heart if it receives input  from outside the body in the form of emotional connections with others. Professor Antonio Damasio has a similar view. He says that love enriches a person's imagination and creativity, and makes a person's body work better. He also believes that love can even improve the body's ability to fight against disease. Damasio's wise words of advice are \\" Choose love and you will live longer.\\" Question: The main idea of this passage is   _  .

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket.

What might they be watching?  Choices:  - movies - school - theatre - event - new york  The rationale to choose \\"movies\\" as the answer is that:\\nThe answer to this question is:","response":"\\"movies.\\" The rationale for this choice revolves around the context provided in the question and general customs associated with each option.\\n\\nAt intermission, people viewing a performance often take a break. Intermissions are common in theaters (for plays), concerts, and other live performances to provide the audience and performers a brief respite. However, the critical clue in this question is the mention of popcorn purchasing during intermission. Out of the options provided - movies, school, theatre, event, and New York - the practice of having an intermission for popcorn purchasing aligns best with movie-watching customs.\\n\\nIn movie theaters, there is traditionally a snack counter where audiences can buy drinks, candy, and notably popcorn. Popcorn and movies have been mentally linked for many people given this long-standing custom, making it conventional for audiences to enjoy popcorn while watching a movie. Additionally, although it's uncommon, some extended movie screenings may have intermissions during which viewers can buy snacks and use the comfort room.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the other choices in the list - school, theatre, event, and New York - either don't typically include popcorn as part of the experience or don't regularly include intermissions in the same way as movies. \\n\\nSchools typically do not have intermissions where students and teachers can buy popcorn—break times are used for other purposes like studying, eating lunch, or socializing. In theatre-setting, although there could be an intermission, popcorn is not usually part of the theatre etiquette—it is seen as distracting and could even detract from the immersive experience of the performance because of the noise it might create. In general events, the intermission structure and popcorn's place is highly variable and not consistent.\\n\\nAs for \\"New York,\\" it's not an activity or event but rather a place, making it an unlikely answer to the question. While one could argue that there are movie theaters in New York, it isn't specific enough compared to the direct relevance of \\"movies.\\"\\"\\"\\n\\nSo, given the popcorn purchase during an intermission, the most plausible scenario would indeed be, watching a movie."},{"question":"Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who had a procedure that took 55 minutes and was a complete success? ?  After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is  and the situation: Robert is generating waves using an oscilloscope in his high school physics class. As part of the experiment, Robert first has to create waves with a long wavelength, waves that we will call long waves. Afterwards, Robert has to create waves with a short wavelength, waves that we will call short waves.  Answer the following question: Which waves will have a higher frequency?\\nAnswer:","response":"The short waves will have a higher frequency. This is because wavelength and frequency are inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases, and vice versa. Since short waves have shorter wavelengths, they will have a higher frequency compared to the long waves."},{"question":"Question: \\"According to the CCTV interview, what may the company Microsoft be using to take advantage of users' secure details concerning Windows 8??\\"  Context: \\"In June 2014, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows 8 as a threat to national security. The story featured an interview with Ni Guangnan, who stated that operating systems could aggregate \\"sensitive user information\\" that could be used to \\"understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society\\", and alleged that per documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the U.S. government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information. Yang Min, a computer scientist at Fudan University, also stated that \\"the security features of Windows 8 are basically to the benefit of Microsoft, allowing them control of the users' data, and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security.\\" Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network Sina Weibo, which stated that the company had never \\"assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients\\" or provided client data to the U.S. government, never \\"provided any government the authority to directly visit\\" or placed any backdoors in its products and services, and that it had never concealed government requests for client data.\\"  Answer:\\nThe answer to this question is:","response":"Microsoft may be using various means to take advantage of users' secure details concerning Windows 8, according to the CCTV interview and the statements made by Ni Guangnan and Yang Min. These methods may involve the aggregation of sensitive user information, cooperation with the U.S. government, security features within the operating system, and potential backdoors.\\n\\n1. Aggregation of sensitive user information: Ni Guangnan mentioned in the interview that operating systems, such as Windows 8, could aggregate \\"sensitive user information,\\" which might be used to \\"understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society.\\" This implies that Microsoft may be collecting and analyzing data from Windows 8 users, possibly gaining insights into various aspects of their lives, including economic and social activities.\\n\\n2. Cooperation with the U.S. government: The interview also alleged that documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that the U.S. government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information. This suggests that Microsoft may have been collaborating with government agencies to access users' secure details, which could be a cause for concern regarding users' privacy and the security of their data.\\n\\n3. Security features of Windows 8: According to Yang Min, a computer scientist at Fudan University, \\"the security features of Windows 8 are basically to the benefit of Microsoft, allowing them control of the users' data, and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security.\\" This statement implies that certain security features within the operating system may be designed to give Microsoft greater control over user data, potentially granting them access to sensitive information.\\n\\n4. Potential backdoors: In a series of posts on the Chinese social network Sina Weibo, Microsoft denied ever providing any government the authority to directly visit or place any backdoors in its products and services. However, the fact that they felt the need to address these concerns may lead some to believe that the possibility of backdoors in Microsoft software cannot be completely ruled out.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Microsoft has denied all these claims and stated that the company had never \\"assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients\\" or provided client data to the U.S. government. The company also emphasized that they had never concealed governmental requests for client data.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the CCTV interview and statements by Ni Guangnan and Yang Min raise concerns about Microsoft potentially using various methods to take advantage of users' secure details concerning Windows 8, including the aggregation of sensitive information, collaboration with the U.S. government, and specific security features within the operating system. However, it is essential to keep in mind that Microsoft has denied these accusations."},{"question":"Question: Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation.

Football Club: The sentence speaks about a football club named Associazione Calcio Chievo Verona, often referred to as A.C. Chievo Verona or simply ChievoVerona. This football club is based in Chievo, a district of 26,000 inhabitants in Verona, Italy.\\n\\n2. The Manager: The name of the manager is mentioned as Rolando Maran. From this information, you can understand that Rolando Maran is the person who is responsible for running the team, strategizing their playstyle, making decisions about team composition and player's positioning, training routines, and managing every aspect of the football team's performance on and off the field. \\n\\n3. Affiliation with Unione Triestina 2012 SSD: The sentence also mentions that Rolando Maran plays for Unione Triestina 2012 SSD. This statement is somewhat confusing since managers, especially in major professional football, are typically not active players. Unione Triestina 2012 Società Sportiva Dilettantistica, commonly referred to as Triestina, is an Italian football club based in Trieste, northeastern Italy.\\n\\nA few clarifying points are necessary after breaking down the data:\\n\\n1. The roles of a football team's manager and a football player are typically separate. Managers are generally retired players who have moved into team management. The initial sentence might be suggesting that Rolando Maran has a role in both A.C. Chievo Verona and Unione Triestina 2012 SSD. However, it does not determine in what capacity he serves Unione Triestina 2012 SSD – whether as a player, coach, or in some other administrative or professional role.\\n\\n2. It isn't usual for a person to manage one professional team and play for another concurrently. It's more plausible to assume a sequential timeline where Rolando Maran once played for Unione Triestina 2012 SSD and now manages A.C. Chievo Verona.\\n\\nThis analysis is based on the assumption that the original sentence may contain an ambiguity or error. For more accurate data extraction, additional context or clarification around Rolando Maran's exact roles within these two teams would be helpful."},{"question":"Given the question: Information:  - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England.

It weakens the insult, it lessens the tension in the situation, and it gets others on your side.  Consider using humor the next time someone puts you down.  You might find it appropriate to even exaggerate or extend the put down, which serves to further lessen the power of the insult. For example, if someone insulted you with the comment, “Your ears are so big,” you could offer a humorous response by saying, “Oh yes.  The better to hear you with, my dear” (a reference to Little Miss Riding Hood). Laughing at an insult can be a very powerful response. Laughter makes the insult seem insignificant, and it also communicates that you were not hurt by the insult.  Furthermore, it takes away the emotional power that the insulting person was hoping to gain from putting you down. Bullies are typically looking for a reaction or disagreement from you to fuel their desire to cause you pain.  Instead of giving the bully what she is looking for, give her the unexpected by agreeing with whatever she said to insult you.  Just say something like, “You are so right.  I couldn’t agree more,” and keep agreeing as she continues the insult. She will get bored of teasing you of you don't provide a reaction. The person launching the insult is probably seeking for you to engage negatively.  By walking away, you are essentially ignoring the person’s insult and the individual himself. Try to walk away the next time someone says something unkind. If you want, you can provide a brief comment as you walk away. For example, if your spouse were to say, “You are such a slob,” you response could be, “Okay,” and then walk away.\\nWhat is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article emphasizes the use of humor as an effective way to respond to insults, as it weakens the insult, reduces tension in the situation, and gains the support of others.

Answer choices: - emotion  - absence  - murmur  - energy  - waves  - arteries  - feelings  - voltage\\nAnswer:","response":"Vibrating matter can cause music through various modes, each of which contributes to the overall experience and perception of music. Here, we will discuss each of the mentioned answer choices in depth, providing a better understanding of how vibrating matter can create music.\\n\\n1. Emotion: Music is often associated with the emotions it can evoke in the listener. Vibrating matter can cause music through emotion because different frequencies, tempos, and harmonies produce different emotional responses in the listener. These emotions, in turn, influence our perception and enjoyment of music. For instance, a melancholic tune may resonate with someone experiencing sadness, while an upbeat one may connect with someone in a joyful mood.\\n\\n2. Absence: Absence refers to the effect of silence or pauses in music, which is a vital element that gives structure, depth, and dynamics to a musical piece. Vibrating matter can create music through the absence of sound, creating tension and contrast. This phenomenon impacts the aesthetics of a composition and allows for the interaction of various elements within the piece.\\n\\n3. Murmur: A murmur is a low, continuous, and indistinct sound that is often perceived as soothing or calming. Vibrating matter can create music through these gentle sounds, providing a subtle backdrop or ambiance. This is particularly useful in creating atmosphere or tension in a piece, such as in film scores or background music for events.\\n\\n4. Energy: Vibrating matter creates sound waves that travel through a medium, such as air or water, and reach our ears as a form of energy. Energy transfers from the vibrating matter into the medium, which then oscillates to produce the sound waves we perceive as music. This energy is essential in the process of turning vibrations into the music we hear and enjoy.\\n\\n5. Waves: Sound waves are the primary way through which vibrating matter creates music. These waves are oscillations in a medium that propagate as a result of the vibration of objects, such as musical instruments or vocal cords. The movement and interactions of these waves produce different frequencies and amplitudes, which our auditory system interprets as sound.\\n\\n6. Arteries: Although arteries aren't directly related to the creation of music, they can contribute to our experience and perception of music. The circulatory system, including arteries and veins, plays a role in supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain. Adequate blood flow allows the brain to function optimally, enabling us to process and appreciate the different elements of music more effectively.\\n\\n7. Feelings: Similar to emotions, feelings are subjective reactions to the world around us, including music. Vibrating matter can cause music through feelings by connecting with and influencing our internal mental states. For instance, music may stir up feelings of nostalgia, excitement, or tranquility, depending on the specific composition and its components.\\n\\n8. Voltage: Voltage can be described as the electric potential difference between two points in a circuit, and it is closely linked with electronic music production. Vibrating matter can cause music through voltage, particularly in the realm of electronic music, where electricity powers synthesizers, samplers, and other audio processing equipment. These devices allow artists to harness the power and flexibility of voltage to create rich, diverse soundscapes that contribute to the overall experience of the music created.\\n\\nIn summary, vibrating matter can cause music through various modes, including emotion, absence, murmur, energy, waves, arteries, feelings, and voltage. Each of these elements is interconnected, contributing to the creation, perception, and experience of music. Ultimately, the diverse nature of these modes allows for a rich array of musical styles and expressions to be born from the vibrations of matter."},{"question":"Information:  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari:  , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language.

He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1990.  - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts.

Described as doting parents, Scarpelli ran the Madison Wellness Center and his wife worked as the receptionist. The business had recently closed, the Daily Mail reports, and the couple was reportedly in deep debt, facing multiple tax liens. Scarpelli was sued in federal court for failing to pay back a student loan and owed about $123,000 to the feds and $42,000 to the state in unpaid taxes since 2003, per the Mail. The couple’s children attended an elite high school, and both enrolled in private colleges. Last year Joseph praised his parents in a school speech, saying they “repeatedly told me that I could wake up one day and lose everyone I love, but no one will ever be able to take away my faith.” A crowd-funding page was set up to aid the children's education.\\n\\nExpand this summary.","response":"A chiropractor named Glenn Scarpelli and his wife Patricia Colant were having a very hard time with money because they owed a lot of it to different people.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".\\n\\nPersistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection. Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism, often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection. There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body. Some viruses once acquired never leave the body. A typical example is the herpes virus, which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise.\\n\\nWhere does the herpes virus avoid?","response":"The herpes virus avoids being cleared from the body by hiding in the nerves. It stays there in a sleeping mode, and when some special situations happen, it can wake up and cause active infections again. It's like the virus playing a game of hide and seek inside your body, hiding in the nerves where your body can't easily find it."},{"question":"Bjorn Ulvaeus was one half of the songwriting genius behind Swedish pop legend ABBA. After the band split up in 1982 Ulvaeus turned his talents to writing musicals, including \\"Mamma Mia,\\" now a blockbuster movie. Bjorn Ulvaeus on the ABBA phenomenon: \\"I'm amazed how this could happen. I'm just grateful and humble.\\" He took My City_My Life on a tour of his home town of Stockholm and talked about his past and future as pop royalty. CNN: What is the secret of ABBA's success? Bjorn Ulvaeus: I think the secret behind the fact that our songs are still around and that ABBA became so big is a lot of factors together. But one of them was definitely that we put so much effort into song writing. We hardly ever toured, we just wrote and wrote and produced the records over a period of seven or eight years. So it's the songs, plus I think the two girls, the voices -- the blend was unique and very special. CNN: Where did get the inspiration for your songs? BU: Well mostly in song writing my experience is that there isn't so much inspiration as hard work. You sit there for hours, days and weeks with a guitar and piano until something good comes. But the urge to write is something you have to have. A conviction, an ambition to write and never stop until you think, \\"This is the best I can do.\\" Watch Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm ». CNN: What drives you? BU: In my career the push has always been to take another step, to try something new. That means that after ABBA, when we split up in 1982, we were onto writing a musical [\\"Chess\\"] because we hadn't done that before. CNN: How do you feel about working in the theater? BU: Every time I sit in the audience and watch a show that I have been involved with, it is such an amazing feeling to see all those people around me, knowing they are actually watching and enjoying something I have written. That is such a feeling of pure joy that never goes away and that's why I guess I'm so attracted to work in the theater. CNN: How did \\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" come about? BU: When you have a big hit on the West End and on Broadway with a musical, as we had with \\"Mamma Mia,\\" there is always the question, \\"when are you going to do the movie?\\" Some people say you shouldn't do it until the actual stage musical is on its last legs, but I don't think that matters. We had been on Broadway for seven or eight years and eight or nine in the West End and we thought now is the time to make that movie. CNN: How has Stockholm changed over the years? BU: A city like Stockholm, being so dynamic and following trends, develops all the time. It's gradually changing but you can hardly see that. It is changing in a very healthy way that cities should change. CNN: How would you describe Stockholm in a few words? BU: Stockholm is unique in the world in that it's built on, I think, 14 islands. There are so many bridges and it doesn't have any high-rise buildings to speak of. It's quite spread out and open and airy with lots of parks. See photos of Bjorn Ulvaeus in Stockholm ». CNN: Let's talk about the cultural scene in Stockholm. BU: There is a very vibrant cultural scene in Stockholm. There are lots of places where there are concerts and there are loads of museums and theaters. There is everything really, and eventually there is going to be an ABBA museum as well. CNN: When will that happen? BU: I don't know -- I like to be arm's length when it comes to a museum about oneself. Other people should do that. CNN: That's quite a Swedish trait... BU: A lot of Swedes are quite modest and unassuming. I think that's actually the closest you can get to a national trait, if there is one. CNN: How does it feel that people from different generations are still enjoying ABBA songs? BU: In a way I'm kind of a bystander looking at this phenomenon that is ABBA, which is still around, and that I thought would be finished in 1981 and forgotten. I'm amazed how this could happen and I don't know why it happened. I'm just grateful and humble. I just sit back and enjoy. CNN: What would you like your legacy to be? BU: I would like for my children to feel that what I left behind was something that I did whole heartedly and with honesty, and something that was the best I could do and hopefully that they too can enjoy.\\n\\nWrite highlights for this article.","response":"1.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

She sweetens the deal with a $25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \\"Lewd is Crude\\", \\"Quit with Tit\\" and \\"Women Right On!\\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \\"Women Right On!\\" is found at the scene.

Their disagreement had escalated to the point where he couldn't bear to even look at his own daughter. \\"I disassociate myself from you,\\" he said with a finality that echoed through the empty halls of their home. Fact 1: Anu's father disassociates himself from daughter.\\n\\nTears streamed down her face as she let the door close behind her, shutting out the silence that had consumed her life. Feeling lost and abandoned, Anu called her friend, Venu. She poured out her heart to him through choked sobs. He listened intently, understanding the depth of her pain. Venu, being the kind and gentle soul that he was, decided to take her to his family's lake house, hoping the serene surroundings would bring her some comfort. Fact 2: Venu takes Anu to place.\\n\\nIt was in this tranquil setting that Anu found solace in Venu's arms. Overwhelmed by his kindness and vulnerability, the two bonded and soon found themselves falling in love. It was a whirlwind romance, one that held the promise of a bright and happy future. But their happiness was short-lived, for Anu was already married to a man named Arun. Fact 3: Arun is Anu married to him.\\n\\nAs news of her relationship with Venu spread through the village, the whispers grew louder and the judgment harsher. Anu's heart ached, but her love for Venu remained steadfast. It was then that she made the hardest decision of her life—she would go back to her father's house, confront the past, and tell him the truth about her relationship. Whether he accepted or rejected her was something she was willing to face for love.\\n\\nWith a trembling heart, she opened the door to her childhood home and stepped inside.

She had confessed her love for a man who was not her husband, tearing down the walls her father had built to protect her reputation and his own.

Sruthi's mother insidiously smiled from the corner of the room, a glint of victory in her eyes.

Fact 5: Sruthi's mother asks Anu to arrange her daughter's and Venu's wedding.\\n\\nThrough tear-filled eyes, she looked at her cousin's smug expression with a newfound determination to fight for the man she loved. Anu turned to face her father once more, her voice carrying the resolve and strength she had been deprived of for so long. As she boldly revealed her intentions, everyone in the room stared at her in shock. She would stand against her family's expectations and the confines of tradition, no matter the cost.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, Anu and Venu's love blossomed, nurtured by their newfound courage. Together, they faced the judgment and rejection of their families, choosing love over obligation. Despite the obstacles they encountered, their unyielding commitment to each other paved the way for a brighter future.\\n\\nThrough the darkest moments in Anu's life, Venu had been the beacon of hope that guided her. Their love had risen above the shackles of societal norms, creating a bond that could never be severed.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  I am facing a new situation today: Croatia and Italy were two countries of similar size and population located on opposite shores of the same sea. Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country caused the formation of hypoxia?\\nA:","response":"Based on the information provided in the background article, we can analyze which country is more likely to cause the formation of hypoxia in the sea.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the main causes of hypoxia\\n- The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals, mainly agriculture fertilizer chemicals, livestock and human waste.\\n\\nStep 2: Examine the economies of Croatia and Italy\\n- Croatia: Economy based on tourism and fishing.\\n- Italy: Economy based on conventional agriculture.\\n\\nStep 3: Determine which activities are more likely to contribute to hypoxia\\n- Fertilizers and livestock waste in agriculture can lead to excessive nutrients and chemical runoff into rivers, ultimately reaching the ocean.

Article: Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime.

Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island.

Title: Mother and Son Movie plot: \\"Mother and Son\\" (1997) is a love story, not of the \\"Romeo and Juliette\\" or \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. \\"Mother and Son\\" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by \\"Father and Son\\" (2003), and by \\"Two Brothers and a Sister,\\" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads.

It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country...., what would be the answer ?\\nAnswer:","response":"The answer to the question would be: In 2017, the nominal GDP rank of the global economy of India, the country that became independent in 1947, was the sixth largest."},{"question":"Q:-  Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body.

When it comes to walking over a lake, we are essentially referring to the ice covering the lake's surface, which will only form when the temperature drops below the freezing point of water, which is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under normal conditions.\\n\\nIn the given options, \\"happy dogs,\\" \\"meowing cats,\\" and \\"hot lava\\" have no impact on the formation of ice over the lake. Happy dogs and meowing cats represent unrelated scenarios that won't alter the temperature or physical state of water. Hot lava, on the other hand, would actually contribute to the opposite effect, as it would lead to an increase in temperature, and subsequently, a prevention of freezing.\\n\\nFreezing temperatures, as the name suggests, are essential for the freezing process to take place. As the temperature of water falls below its freezing point, water molecules slow down and lose energy. This loss of energy causes the molecules to come closer together, forming a crystalline solid structure known as ice. When a lake has completely frozen over and the ice is thick enough to support the weight of a person, it will then be safe to walk over it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, freezing temperatures are necessary for the formation of ice on a lake's surface, which is essential for safely walking over the lake. The other options - happy dogs, meowing cats, and hot lava - are either unrelated or counterproductive to this process."},{"question":"The club paid off outstanding rents and legal fees to Herefordshire Council on Friday after it launched repossession proceedings.\\nA high court petition calling for the club to be wound up was adjourned for six weeks on Monday.\\nClub chairman Andy Lonsdale said a new investor and sponsor would be named within three weeks.\\n\\"We're trying to resolve the problems we've inherited as best we can and as quick as we can,\\" he said.\\n\\"We've got investment.

What victims of Tortious Non-Vaccination should do is file a complaint seeking to certify a defendant class action and bring a claim against all Tortious Non-Vaccinators [who had gotten the disease].\\n\\nI think the kind of burden of proof shifting along the lines of Summers v. Tice would be appropriate. Thus, here, a member of the defendant class would have the opportunity to, say, prove that he could not have infected anyone.\\n\\n[A]nd since it’s a negligence claim, you target the homeowners insurance policy. Anti-vaxers insurance rates will rise to internalize the cost of non-vaccination.\\n\\nSummers v. Tice is a famous tort case in which plaintiff was allowed to recover from his two fellow hunters, when he was injured by one of them but it wasn’t clear which one. Usually, a plaintiff has to show that there’s a greater than 50% chance that the particular defendant he is suing caused his injury; but in this instance the court relaxed the requirement. (I include an edited version of Summers below.)\\n\\nI’m skeptical about my friend’s theory. Summers, I think, is a limited exception to the general tort law rule that the plaintiff must show that his injury was likely caused by the defendant. And I doubt that Summers would be extended to a situation such as communicable disease, given how unrelated and variegated the potential tortfeasors are, how many there are, and how unlikely each one is to have injured this particular plaintiff.\\n\\nI agree that if you know that D has infected P, and D failed to take reasonable precautions to prevent this (e.g., getting vaccinated), this would be tortious under normal negligence principles. (This is often litigated in sexually transmitted disease cases, but historically that came out of other communicable disease cases, where the source of the infection was known; the principle dates back to the late 1800s and early 1900s.) But if a plaintiff is suing everyone who hasn’t been vaccinated and has contracted the disease — some of whom had more serious forms of the disease and some of whom had less serious forms, some of whom spent a lot of time during their illness around other people and some of whom spent less, and nearly of all whom are likely not to have caused plaintiff’s illness, directly or indirectly — I don’t think the Summers theory would or should apply to defendants.\\n\\nIndeed, this pretty closely tracks the way the law deals with pollution. In some situations, particular polluters can indeed be sued under general tort law principles for harm to particular plaintiffs. But in large part because of the difficulty proving causation, the tort route is often unavailable. The law has (generally) dealt with this not by relaxing the causation requirement, but by setting up a regulatory scheme requiring polluters to take various steps to diminish pollution.\\n\\nAnd I think pollution in general is a good metaphor for non-vaccination. Factories sometimes emit chemical pollutants. Factory owners have a legal duty to take various reasonable steps to reduce the risk and magnitude of such emissions.\\n\\nHuman bodies sometimes emit biological pollutants. It makes sense that humans would have a legal duty to take reasonable steps to reduce the risk of such emissions. In the process, they also on balance help themselves, because the pollutants hurt them first. But they also have a moral and legal duty to take reasonable steps to protect others against the pollution that they could inadvertently emit.\\n\\nFor some more thoughts on immunization, liberty, and safety, see this thread, which arose in the specialized context of immunization against HPV, which is a largely sexually transmitted disease. The arguments there (especially in the Libertarianism and Communicable Disease post) strike me as even more apt for more casually transmitted diseases.\\n\\nHere is an edited version of Summers v. Tice:\\n\\nPlaintiff’s action was against both defendants for an injury to his right eye and face as the result of being struck by bird shot discharged from a shotgun. The case was tried by the court without a jury and the court found that on November 20, 1945, plaintiff and the two defendants were hunting quail on the open range. Each of the defendants was armed with a 12 gauge shotgun loaded with shells containing 7½ size shot.\\n\\nPrior to going hunting plaintiff discussed the hunting procedure with defendants, indicating that they were to exercise care when shooting and to “keep in line.” In the course of hunting plaintiff proceeded up a hill, thus placing the hunters at the points of a triangle. The view of defendants with reference to plaintiff was unobstructed and they knew his location. Defendant Tice flushed a quail which rose in flight to a ten foot elevation and flew between plaintiff and defendants.\\n\\nBoth defendants shot at the quail, shooting in plaintiff’s direction. At that time defendants were 75 yards from plaintiff. One shot struck plaintiff in his eye and another in his upper lip. Finally it was found by the court that as the direct result of the shooting by defendants the shots struck plaintiff as above mentioned and that defendants were negligent in so shooting and plaintiff was not contributorily negligent….\\n\\nThe one shot that entered plaintiff’s eye was the major factor in assessing damages and that shot could not have come from the gun of both defendants. It was from one or the other only….\\n\\nWhen we consider the relative position of the parties and the results that would flow if plaintiff was required to pin the injury on one of the defendants only, a requirement that the burden of proof on that subject be shifted to defendants becomes manifest. They are both wrongdoers both negligent toward plaintiff. They brought about a situation where the negligence of one of them injured the plaintiff, hence it should rest with them each to absolve himself if he can.\\n\\nThe injured party has been placed by defendants in the unfair position of pointing to which defendant caused the harm. If one can escape the other may also and plaintiff is remediless. Ordinarily defendants are in a far better position to offer evidence to determine which one caused the injury….\\n\\nIn a quite analogous situation this Court held that a patient injured while unconscious on an operating table in a hospital could hold all or any of the persons who had any connection with the operation even though he could not select the particular acts by the particular person which led to his disability. Ybarra v. Spangard. There the Court was considering whether the patient could avail himself of res ipsa loquitur, rather than where the burden of proof lay, yet the effect of the decision is that plaintiff has made out a case when he has produced evidence which gives rise to an inference of negligence which was the proximate cause of the injury. It is up to defendants to explain the cause of the injury.\\n\\nIt was there said: “If the doctrine is to continue to serve a useful purpose, we should not forget that ‘the particular force and justice of the rule, regarded as a presumption throwing upon the party charged the duty of producing evidence, consists in the circumstance that the chief evidence of the true cause, whether culpable or innocent, is practically accessible to him but inaccessible to the injured person.’” Similarly in the instant case plaintiff is not able to establish which of defendants caused his injury….\\n\\nEugene Volokh teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law, where he has also often taught copyright law, criminal law, and a seminar on firearms regulation policy.\\n\\nWrite a title for it.","response":"Exploring the Concept of Tortious Non-Vaccination and Its Implications in Legal Cases"},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary:\\n\\nTry \\"reality checks\\" throughout the day.

It's not uncommon for individuals to lose touch with the present moment, dwelling on past experiences or focusing on future plans, neglecting what really matters – the now. This is where the concept of \\"reality checks\\" comes into play. By consciously devoting time to deliberately assess our current situation, we improve our ability to live more fully in the present moment, thereby increasing our overall happiness and productivity. This article will discuss the benefits of integrating reality checks into your daily routine and will offer some tips and tricks for acing your reality checks and gradually building up to bigger activities.\\n\\nStep 1: Try \\"Reality Checks\\" Throughout the Day\\n\\nTo begin incorporating reality checks into your day, try setting reminders for yourself to take a few moments periodically to evaluate your current situation. This could be as simple as setting an alarm on your phone, or placing sticky notes in visible locations. By doing this, you create an opportunity for yourself to pause and reflect on how you are feeling, the thoughts you are experiencing, and whether your actions are in alignment with your values and goals.\\n\\nStep 2: Ace Your Reality Check\\n\\nOnce you've set the stage for regular reality checks, the next step is to make the most of these moments. You can accomplish this by asking yourself questions that will help you gain insight into your present experience. Here are some example questions to ask yourself during a reality check:\\n\\n- How am I feeling right now, both physically and emotionally?\\n- What is currently occupying my thoughts?\\n- Am I currently working towards my goals and priorities?\\n- Am I engaging in any activities or habits that are counterproductive or harmful?\\n\\nBy asking yourself these questions, you actively engage with your present experience, allowing you to better understand your current mental and emotional state.\\n\\nStep 3: Gradually Build Up to Bigger Activities\\n\\nAs you become more comfortable and proficient in conducting reality checks, you can start incorporating more significant practices that will further enhance your ability to connect with the present moment. Some examples of these practices include:\\n\\n- Gratitude journaling: Regularly write down the things you are grateful for, helping you to cultivate a deep appreciation for the present moment.\\n- Mindfulness meditation: Dedicate time each day to practice mindfulness meditation, focusing solely on your breath or another focal point, enabling you to build a stronger connection with the present.\\n- Engage in activities that require full concentration: Look for hobbies or tasks that demand your undivided attention, promoting presence and focus.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIncorporating reality checks into your daily routine can have profound effects on your overall well-being and happiness. By making a conscious effort to regularly assess and engage with your present experience, you'll find that you are better equipped to handle any challenges life throws your way. Start by setting reminders to conduct reality checks throughout the day, acing your checks by asking yourself insightful questions, and finally, building up to bigger activities that promote an even greater connection with the present moment. By taking these steps, you're on your way to transforming your everyday experiences and living a more fulfilling life."},{"question":"CNBBR297DLL blue screen slow PC program and system crashing Fix\\n\\nAdd punctuation.","response":"CNBBR297DLL blue screen, slow PC, program, and system crashing: Fix.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the issue - The user is experiencing a blue screen error, slow PC performance, program issues, and system crashes, and they need a fix for these problems.\\n\\nStep 2: Research possible solutions - Look up potential fixes for the CNBBR297DLL blue screen error, methods to improve PC performance, and ways to prevent program and system crashing.\\n\\nStep 3: Apply fixes - Implement the researched fixes, which may include updating drivers, optimizing performance settings, using a registry cleaner, and running a system file checker.\\n\\nStep 4: Test the results - After applying the fixes, test the user's PC to see if the blue screen error, slow performance, program issues, and system crashes have been resolved.\\n\\nStep 5: Follow up and support - If the issues have been fixed, provide the user with any necessary information on how to maintain their system's performance and stability.

What actor and political activist played a role in the film Tea and Sympathy?\\nThe answer to this question is:","response":"Deborah Kerr was the actress and political activist who played a significant role in the film \\"Tea and Sympathy\\". \\n\\nDeborah Kerr was a Scottish-born actress who, throughout her career, garnered exceptional popularity for her distinctive ability to adopt and master different accents, such as American, English and even Australian. This unique trait was highly instrumental in enabling Kerr to portray an array of diverse roles across multiple genres – drama, comedy, romance, and, adventure.\\n\\nHer role in \\"Tea and Sympathy\\", released in 1956, stands as one of her most commendable performances. This film was directed by Vincente Minnelli and produced by Pandro S. Berman.\\n\\nIn the film, Kerr reprised her Broadway role in the film adaptation. She played the character of Laura Reynolds. The story revolves around Tom Lee, a young man who struggles to fit into an all-boys boarding school due to his non-masculine interests. He finds himself alienated and ridiculed by his classmates and even his teachers. Kerr's character, Laura, who is a housemaster's wife and one of the few female presences in Tom's life, becomes his support. She empathizes with his predicament, and they form a bond that leads Laura to challenge the rigid and overbearing norms of masculinity in their environment. Kerr's portrayal of a compassionate, understanding, and empathetic character was highly praised.\\n\\nBesides her exceptional acting career, Kerr was an outspoken political activist. She was passionate about her work in promoting world peace and advocating for children's rights around the world – working closely with non-profit organisations like UNICEF.\\n\\nShe was nominated for the Oscar for best actress for her role in 'Tea and Sympathy' and it was also for performances of this caliber that the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences awarded her an honorary Oscar in 1994, for her indelible contributions to the film industry.\\n\\nEven though Deborah Kerr is no longer with us, her legacy remains very much in the heart of the film industry.

Her performance in \\"Tea and Sympathy\\" stands as an iconic testament of her acting abilities, perfectly amalgamating her artistic depth and her social consciousness."},{"question":"Summarize this article:\\n\\nImmortality, much? Scientists believe that the hydra may be able to eternally resist going gentle into that good night. \\n  \\n The Hydra of Greek myth was a terrifying many-headed water monster with virulent breath and noxious blood. And it was a creature with the wonderfully weird regenerative trait of being able to grow more heads when one was chopped off. Meanwhile, over in the pond, we have a genus of real-life little animals that share their name with the Greek horror show. And while they have the beast's regenerative powers in common, unlike the Hydra who was slain by Heracles, the little wiggly pond hydra appear to be immortal. \\n  \\n Belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, hydra are part of a group of organisms known as cnidarians which include jellyfish and sea anemones. And even though hydra are wee little multicellular organisms of less than half an inch in length, they are marvels of the animal world. \\n  \\n They feed on small aquatic invertebrates; they stick to surfaces with their single adhesive foot and hunt by somersaulting. They bend over and grab the surface with their mouth and tentacles, release the foot, and the body swings around to a new place where they re-attach their foot. Total little acrobats. And though not speedy, this alots them several inches of travel a day. When they attack their prey, they wrap it in their tentacles and can devour it in about 10 minutes; they are able to extend their body walls more than twice their size to consume meals larger than they are. \\n  \\n However, back to the immortality business. By all appearances, they seem to neither age nor die of old age. How can an animal not age? Radiolab's Robert Krulwich wonders the same and asks, why the hydra? \\"If nonsenescence, or biological immortality, is an option in nature, how come this particular mini-bit of pond scum got the big prize?\\" he muses, \\"Why not (excuse me for asking), us? Evolution is such a random, casino-like affair.\\" \\n  \\n To tackle the mystery of the eternal hydra, Krulwich and his NPR science reporter Adam Cole, produced a video to show us more about the immortality-lottery winning hydra: ||||| Everything Dies, Right? But Does Everything Have To Die? Here's A Surprise \\n  \\n A puzzlement. \\n  \\n Why, I wonder, are both these things true?

It has an extremely short life. \\n  \\n Hello, Goodbye, I'm Dead \\n  \\n It hatches. Three days later, it's all grown up, with a fully adult body \\"complete with a mouth, a gut, sensory organs and a brain,\\" says science writer Carl Zimmer. In 72 hours it's ready to make babies, and as soon as it does, it begins to shrivel, crumple ... and usually within a week, it's gone. Dead of old age. \\n  \\n Sad, no? A seven-day life. But now comes the weird part. There's another very small animal (a little bigger than a gastrotrich) that also lives in freshwater ponds and lakes, also matures very quickly, also reproduces within three or four days. But, oh, my God, this one has a totally different life span (and when I say totally, I mean it's radically, wildly, unfathomably different) from a gastrotrich. \\n  \\n It's a hydra. And what it does — or rather, what it doesn't do — is worthy of a motion picture. \\n  \\n So we made one. Well, a little one. With my NPR colleague, science reporter Adam Cole, we're going to show you what science has learned about the hydra. Adam drew it, animated it, scored it, edited it.

If nonsenescence, or biological immortality, is an option in nature, how come this particular mini-bit of pond scum got the big prize? Why not the gastrotrich? Why not (excuse me for asking) ... us? Evolution is such a random, casinolike affair; it's startling to learn that longevity varies without regard to size. I know Daniel Martinez's hydras were cleaned, fed, protected. They didn't live in the wild. But still, they have lasted and lasted and lasted. I expect sequoias, redwoods and whales to last longer than mayflies, daisies and clover. Big things go on, but when two little freshwater animals have such drastically different life expectancies, all I can think is ... whoa! Life is a puzzlement. \\n  \\n My friend Carl Zimmer introduced me to the gastrotrich in his introductory essay to Rachel Sussman's book, The Oldest Living Things in the World.

Context: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. Question: What do museums think about Chihuly's works becoming part of their exhibits?

Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages. As it turns out for my siblings and...

Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology.

Let us analyze the premise and hypothesis in more detail.\\n\\nFirst, let's look at the premise:\\n\\n\\"yeah well they make allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take the test\\"\\n\\nThe statement suggests that allowances are made for certain situations, conditions, or circumstances at the time of taking the test. This could include, for example, technical issues, health-related problems, or personal/mental/emotional factors that could impact an individual's performance on the test. These allowances might be designed to ensure fairness and to accommodate the specific needs of different test-takers. The premise implies that allowances are made provided that such problems are reported at the time of the test, so proper accommodations and adjustments can be put in place.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the hypothesis:\\n\\n\\"They will know if you are lying on the test\\"\\n\\nThe hypothesis proposes that test administrators will be able to detect dishonesty or falsification by test-takers. This could entail spotting inconsistencies within the test-taker's responses, identifying patterns of deceptive behavior, or using other tools and methods to assess the truthfulness of the individual. While test administrators may possess certain strategies and techniques to detect dishonesty, it is important to recognize that any conclusion about the validity of this hypothesis would require a deeper analysis of the specific test, its methodology, the context in which it is administered, and the expertise of those interpreting the results.\\n\\nGiven the premise provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"They will know if you are lying on the test\\" is true. While the premise suggests that allowances are made in certain situations, it does not directly address the issue of lying, deception, or dishonesty on the test. Moreover, the detection of lying falls under a different scope of considerations from those related to accommodations and adjustments made during the test.\\n\\nFurther investigation into the test's design, the capabilities of administrators, and the context of the testing process would be necessary to draw a more informed conclusion about the truth of the hypothesis. It is essential to consider how test administrators or institutions might address lying and deception, any specific procedures or tools in place to detect dishonesty, and whether a test-taker’s reporting of issues is scrutinized for deceit.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the premise provided may hint at the potential for accommodations during the test-taking process, it does not offer enough evidence to support or refute the hypothesis \\"They will know if you are lying on the test.\\" A deeper analysis of the testing context, methodology, and administration is necessary to draw a more accurate conclusion about the validity of this hypothesis."},{"question":"Q: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of numbers.

It is hinted that Darcy didn't have a normal family or childhood by how she constantly goes on about Rachel being the sister she never had and the mother she always wanted. Ethan is Rachel's best guy friend, who also has known Darcy since childhood. There is a history shown that for the 6th grade dance Ethan went with both Rachel and Darcy, presumably because Darcy couldn't let Rachel have a date when she didn't.

What are suggestions for how I can control my calorie intake?\\n\\nWould the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Answer 1: To determine how many calories you need to eat when you start road cycling, we'll need to consider a few additional factors, such as the distance and intensity of your cycling sessions, your weight, and your overall goals (such as weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain). Here's a step-by-step process to estimate your calorie needs:\\n\\nStep 1: Determine the calories burned during road cycling. On average, a person can burn approximately 400-600 calories per hour of road cycling, depending on intensity and weight. \\n\\nStep 2: Calculate your cycling sessions per week and estimate total calories burned. For example, if you cycle for one hour, three times a week, you might burn approximately 1200-1800 calories from cycling.\\n\\nStep 3: Combine your normal calorie intake (2000 calories) with the additional calories burned from road cycling. If you want to maintain your current weight, add these burned calories to your regular intake (e.g., 2000 + 1200 = 3200 calories per week).\\n\\nStep 4: Divide the total calories by seven to estimate your daily calorie needs. For our example, 3200 / 7 = approximately 457 calories per day more than your regular intake. This would bring your daily intake to around 2457 calories per day.\\n\\nKeep in mind that these numbers are approximate, and individual factors may vary. It's important to listen to your body and adjust your calorie intake accordingly.\\n\\nAnswer 2: Controlling calorie intake while eating out can be challenging but manageable with some simple strategies:\\n\\n1. Research the menu beforehand and make healthier choices. Many restaurants have their menus available online, allowing you to plan your meal ahead of time.\\n\\n2. Watch portion sizes. Restaurant portions can be more significant than necessary. Consider asking for a half portion, sharing a meal with a colleague, or packing half of your meal to eat later.\\n\\n3. Limit high-calorie beverages like sugary drinks and alcohol. Opt for water or low-calorie alternatives.\\n\\n4. Choose dishes that are steamed, grilled, or baked, instead of fried, and ask for sauces and dressings on the side.\\n\\n5. Opt for a salad, vegetables, or fruit as your side dish instead of fries or other high-calorie options.\\n\\n6. Be mindful of overall caloric intake throughout the day. If you know you'll be eating out for dinner, try and have a lighter lunch or breakfast.\\n\\nThe answers to these questions are not the same. The first answer provides a method for calculating your calories when you start road cycling. The second answer offers strategies for controlling calorie intake while eating out, which could help in maintaining a balanced diet regardless of your physical activity levels."},{"question":"Question: Question: What does she make Charlie promise to do after she helps him escape?

In ancient Greece people knew about the healing  powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially   produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red   and ultra-violet   rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\".

There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold.

Some, however, remained hesitant and unsure, choosing to stay away from the mine until they were confident the situation had been resolved peacefully.\\n\\nWhile Lonmin, the company which owns the platinum mine, has sought to address the concerns raised by the labor dispute, they have also acknowledged the significant financial impact that this strike has had on their bottom line. Platinum prices have surged globally due to the unrest and anticipated decrease in production output, putting immense pressure on the company to address the workers' grievances and restore normal operations as quickly as possible. \\n\\nIn response to the violence and loss of life, the South African government launched an investigation into the underlying issues behind the deadly confrontation, including the validity of the workers' wage demands and working conditions at the site. Labor organizations, human rights groups, and political parties have also weighed in on the matter, with some criticizing the government's handling of the crisis and calling for broader conversations about the income inequality that continues to plague South Africa, nearly three decades after apartheid. \\n\\nMoving forward, Lonmin executives have pledged to work closely with local authorities, employees, and community representatives to reach a solution that adequately addresses the concerns of all parties involved. This process will likely entail the opening of dialogues and negotiations concerning wage increases, improved working conditions, and stronger employee representation in company decision-making. \\n\\nIn the meantime, the tragic events at the Rustenburg mine have brought the plight of South Africa's mine workers to the forefront of public discourse, shedding light on the precarious balance between the economic success of large companies and the well-being of their labor force. This tragedy serves as a sober reminder of the importance of ensuring that the gains of economic growth are equitably distributed and that worker rights and safety are respected across industries and borders.\\n\\nAs the mine slowly resumes production and the nation continues to grapple with the fallout from the strike, all those involved - from the workers on the ground to the executives at the top - must commit to fostering communication, cooperation, and mutual understanding in the pursuit of a more stable, equitable, and peaceful future for South Africa's mining industry."},{"question":"Question: Information:  - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth.

Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888.  - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology .  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students.  Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College.  - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley.  - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866  June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

So I was trying to sleep one time, and I sleep under the blankets 99% of the time. I sleep downstairs, so hearing noise is pretty normal. Also, my door doesn’t lock, or even latch the door handle, so you can just push it open. So I was laying down, maybe at 60% in terms of how close I was to falling asleep, so I just had to lay down for like 5 more minutes. But there are a lot of noises, and they freak me out even though I just sorta pretend that they’re definitely a cat or my dog or something. So, I’m already slightly spooked, but I’m ignoring it and going to sleep anyway. But then, I hear my door open. That isn’t too weird, I do have cats, so even though by this point my fear is intense, I just sorta blow it off and keep trying to sleep. And then, something that’s never happened in a situation like this, I feel something moving towards me on my bed. It feels like a cats movements, with light feet making slight reverberations on the bed. So my fear goes away entirely, and I’m like “Oh okay, it’s just the cat, that’s good.” And I lift my blankets off my head to let my cat under with me, and because the fear seemed to make the atmosphere under there very hot and tense, and then I look at my bed and there’s nothing. So I just pretend nothing happened and go to sleep, but that still sticks with me and even though it’s kinda underwhelming I still think it was very strange since I wasn’t at the “edge of consciousness” stage of going to sleep, so I feel like the chances I imagined it aren’t too high.

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping $8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Article: After commuting, cooking dinner and doing household chores, the average parent has just 30 minutes to devote to their children in the evenings, according to a new study. One in four working parents worry that half an hour simply isn't enough, while almost half fret that they aren't a good enough parent during the week. However, parenting experts believe just 12 minutes a day may be enough for mothers and fathers to fully _ with their child -- as long as they ask the right questions. Child psychologist Dr Claire Halsey said asking a series of open-ended questions can help improve parents' relationship with their children. Among the questions recommended in the research are: \\"How many times have you smiled today -- what made you laugh?\\"; \\"Can you act out what you did at breaktime?\\"; \\"Who is taller -- mummy or your teacher?\\" and \\"What are the names of the toys you played with today?\\" Parents of older children are advised to start up a conversation with: \\"I've got a great story for you but I want one in return... you first!\\" or \\"Tell me some school gossip ... _ !\\" Dr Halsey, working with the makers of Ribena Plus, who commissioned the research, said: \\"There is no one as tough on their own parenting skills as a parent -- but this study shows there is no need for parents to be so harsh. It's hard for working parents to juggle all their responsibilities and it can feel like guilt is simply a parent's lot -- but it's absolutely not. By using clever tactics such as a little preparation alongside use of open-ended questions -- such as 'Tell me what the best bit about your day was?' -- parents can reduce the time worrying about chores and work and spend more time learning about their children's day.\\" Question: Which of the following open-ended questions is for a three-year-old child?

But Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: he attempts to see the good, or silver linings, in all that he experiences. At dinner with his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), Pat meets Veronica's sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow with depression and relationship problems. Sparks fly between Pat and Tiffany and she tries to connect by offering casual sex, but Pat keeps focusing on getting Nikki back. Tiffany tries to get closer to Pat and even offers to deliver a letter to Nikkiâif, in return, he will practice dancing with her (which she does as a therapy) and to partner with her in an upcoming dance competition. He reluctantly agrees and the two begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki that he has changed and become a better person. Patrizio hopes to open his own restaurant and has resorted to illegal bookmaking. Having put virtually all of his money on the outcome of a Philadelphia Eagles game, he asks Pat to attend as a \\"good-luck charm\\". Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, in which she cautiously hints there may be a chance for reconciliation between them. Before he gets into the stadium, Pat gets involved in a fight when some racist fans harass the Indian fans there including his therapist...\\nAnswer:","response":"In the movie \\"The Silver Linings Playbook,\\" Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, supposedly delivers a letter to Nikki, Pat's estranged wife. This arrangement is part of a deal proposed by Tiffany to Pat, who is trying to reconnect with Nikki after his release from a mental health facility. Pat, who is focusing on getting Nikki back, gets to know Tiffany through a common friend. Despite their instant connection, Pat is unable to see beyond his obsession with getting back to Nikki.\\n\\nTiffany seizes this opportunity and offers to help him reach out to Nikki. She suggests delivering a letter from Pat to Nikki, who has moved away and has a restraining order against him. However, this deal comes with a condition - Pat must partner with Tiffany in a dance competition and dedicate considerable time to practice. Tiffany uses dance as a therapy to deal with her own issues, including depression and relationship problems.   \\n\\nReluctantly, Pat agrees to this deal and they start practicing for the dance competition. Pat nurtures the hope that the competition will serve as a platform to prove to Nikki that he has changed and is a better person now. Later, Tiffany hands Pat a typed reply from Nikki. In this letter, Nikki vaguely suggests that there might be a chance for them to reconcile. This reinforces Pat's belief in his plan and he gets more invested in the upcoming dance competition.\\n\\nHowever, the movie delves into the complexities of human relationships and emotional healing, and keeps it ambiguous whether Tiffany really delivers the letter to Nikki or she writes the reply herself to motivate Pat. Nevertheless, the supposed letter from Nikki plays a key role in driving the movie's plot forward."},{"question":"Possible answers: a). yes. b). no.\\nDoes \\"Eton also runs a number of choral and English language courses during the summer months.\\" correctly answer the question of What are some courses Eton offers in the summer months?\\n\\n","response":"Step 1: Analyze the question for key elements\\nThe question asks me to determine if the given statement correctly answers what courses Eton offers in the summer months.\\n\\nStep 2: Identify the key elements in the given statement\\nThe key elements in the statement are: Eton, choral courses, English language courses, and summer months.\\n\\nStep 3: Compare the key elements in the question and statement\\nThe question asks about courses offered by Eton in the summer months.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

Spray the item with rubbing alcohol to create a dull, weathered look. Apply acetone nail polish remover to remove color and shine.","response":"Title: How to Remove Mirror Shine and Create a Weathered Look\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nMirror shine and glossy finishes can look impressive and can add a sense of style and sophistication to various items. However, there might be instances where you'd rather have a more weathered, rustic appearance instead. If you're looking to transform a shiny object into something more worn and aged, follow these simple steps to get it done. This article will guide you through the process of removing that mirror shine and creating a dull, weathered look using a wax stripping product, rubbing alcohol, and acetone nail polish remover.\\n\\nStep 1: Choose the Object\\n\\nFirst off, decide on the object that you want to work on. Ensure that your chosen item is a suitable candidate for this process – avoid objects that may be damaged or destroyed due to harsh chemical treatments. Test the object's material and its response to the chemicals on a small, inconspicuous area before proceeding.\\n\\nStep 2: Wax Stripping\\n\\nHaving selected the object, the first step in removing the mirror shine is to apply a wax stripping product. Wax stripping products are specially formulated to break down and dissolve wax coatings and polish on various surfaces like furniture or shoes.\\n\\n(1) Clean the object thoroughly. Remove any dirt or debris that might interfere with the wax stripping process.\\n(2) Put on gloves and other protective equipment as necessary to protect your skin and eyes from the chemicals.\\n(3) Apply the wax stripper following the manufacturer's guidelines. Ensure that you cover the entire surface of the object.\\n(4) Allow the wax stripper to work on the surface according to the recommended time frame on the product label.\\n(5) Wipe away the dissolved wax with a soft cloth or sponge. \\n\\nStep 3: Dulling the Surface with Rubbing Alcohol\\n\\nOnce the wax has been stripped away, the next step is to create a dull, weathered look by spraying the object with rubbing alcohol. \\n\\n(1) Pour some rubbing alcohol into a spray bottle.\\n(2) Spray a light, even layer of alcohol over the object's surface.\\n(3) Allow the alcohol to air-dry. As the alcohol evaporates, it will leave behind a dull, matte finish.\\n\\nStep 4: Removing Color and Shine with Acetone Nail Polish Remover\\n\\nIf the object still has some residual color or shine after the rubbing alcohol treatment, you can use acetone nail polish remover to further dull its appearance.\\n\\n(1) Dip a cotton ball or pad into the acetone nail polish remover.\\n(2) Gently rub the soaked cotton ball or pad on the object's surface, focusing on the areas with remaining color or shine.\\n(3) Wipe the surface with a clean, dry cloth to remove dissolved polish and color.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nFollowing these steps will help you effectively remove the mirror shine and create a more weathered, rustic look on your chosen item. Whether it's a piece of furniture or a decorative object, this process can transform your glossy finish into something more subdued and charming. Remember to wear proper protective gear and work in a well-ventilated area, as you'll be working with chemicals that can have strong fumes and may be harmful to your skin and eyes."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below:\\nSweet maudlin is another nickname for strawberry.\\n\\nAchillea ageratum, also known as sweet yarrow, sweet-Nancy, or sweet maudlin, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, native to southern Europe (Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Balkans).

After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training. \\n\\nQuestion: \\"When did Abu Zubaydah say, \\"The time for training is over.\\"\\"\\n\\nResponse: \\"Novemer 30, 1999\\"\\nOptions:\\n (a). no;\\n (b). yes;\\nDoes the response correctly answer the question?\\n\\n","response":"(b). yes\\n\\nThe response correctly answers the question because it provides the exact date when Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over,\\" which is November 30, 1999.

Article: What do you do if you don't get into your first choice of university? That's the dilemma that faces thousands of British students every year. Many candidates turn to Clearing, the service that helps find university places for students at the last moment. If they don't have the marks to get into their first choice of institution, Clearing tells them about places available at other universities, though they might have to read another subject. But this year has seen a record number of people applying to university. This, combined with the weak economy, an uncertain job market and budget cuts at universities, means that _ than usual. Some sources say six students have applied for each remaining undergraduate university place. The British university admissions service, UCAS, says up to a quarter of this year's university applicants --- almost 190,000 people --- still don't have a place on a degree course. That's a rise of over 46,000 students from last year. Faced with these figures, some British students might be thinking of an interesting alternative: studying abroad.

Bush.\\n\\nGenerate a detailed description of this data","response":"The Gulf War was a significant military operation that took place between August 2, 1990 and February 28, 1991 in the Middle East, primarily in Iraq and Kuwait. This conflict is sometimes referred to as Operation Desert Shield, which was the initial defensive response to the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, and Operation Desert Storm, which was the offensive operation led by the United States and a coalition of international forces to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. At the helm of this strategic military campaign was the commander, then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush.\\n\\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, tensions between Iraq and Kuwait had escalated due to various economic and political factors, including border disputes and disagreements related to oil production. The Iraqi President at the time, Saddam Hussein, accused Kuwait of overproducing oil, which contributed to a decline in oil prices and, consequently, negatively impacted the Iraqi economy. In need of financial resources, Iraq invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait on August 2, 1990.\\n\\nThe international community swiftly condemned this act of aggression, and the United Nations Security Council passed numerous resolutions demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. In response to this crisis, U.S. President George H. W. Bush spearheaded diplomatic efforts to assemble a multinational coalition of forces to counter the Iraqi aggression and ultimately liberate Kuwait. This coalition consisted of more than 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other nations from across the Middle East and Europe.\\n\\nAs the commander of the coalition's military efforts, George H. W. Bush initiated Operation Desert Shield, which focused on the deployment of a significant number of U.S. and international troops, as well as naval, air, and ground forces, to the Arabian Peninsula. The main objective of this operation was to create a deterrent to prevent further Iraqi aggression and protect key regional allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, from potential attacks. During this period, Bush, his administration, and military leaders worked tirelessly to drum up international support for their cause and carefully plan the military operations that would ensue.\\n\\nAfter several months of preparatory operations, diplomatic negotiations, and an international economic embargo against Iraq, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Storm on January 17, 1991. This offensive operation included a large-scale air campaign, which targeted Iraqi military infrastructure, as well as its command and control systems. The ultimate goal was to weaken Saddam Hussein's regime and force the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.\\n\\nFollowing weeks of sustained aerial bombardment, coalition ground forces began a rapid and decisive ground campaign that took advantage of the weakened Iraqi military's lack of coordinated defense. As a result, the coalition successfully liberated Kuwait on February 28, 1991. In total, the war resulted in a low number of U.S. and coalition casualties compared to the substantial losses experienced by Iraq's military and civilian populations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Gulf War was a pivotal moment in modern military history as it showcased the ability of a large coalition of countries to act in unison against a common aggressor. Under the firm leadership of George H. W. Bush, the coalition forces successfully conducted a well-planned and executed military campaign that achieved their objectives. The rapid and decisive victory not only liberated Kuwait but also reinforced the credibility of the United Nations and the international community's commitment to upholding the principles of global peace and security."},{"question":"What claim can be made from the following pieces of evidence?\\n\\n1.

Trump also will request $30 billion in supplementary military spending for fiscal 2017, an administration official said. \\n  \\n But without providing specifics, the administration said that most other discretionary spending programs would be cut to pay for it. Officials singled out foreign aid, one of the smallest parts of the federal budget, saying it would face “large reductions” in spending. \\n  \\n [Budget breakdown: What the Obama White House wants to spend money on] \\n  \\n (Reuters) \\n  \\n It is the first indication of spending priorities by the new administration, with the president set to arrive on Capitol Hill on Tuesday night for a speech to a joint session of Congress. But the full budget negotiations between Trump and Congress will not be complete for many months. \\n  \\n In a statement at the White House on Monday morning, Trump said that his budget would put “America first” by focusing on defense, law enforcement and veterans using money previously spent abroad. \\n  \\n “We are going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people,” he said. “We can do so much more with the money we spend.” \\n  \\n [Analysis: The U.S. foreign-aid budget, visualized] \\n  \\n The White House did not specify how Trump’s budget would address mandatory spending or taxes, promising that those details would come later. The vast majority of federal spending comes from programs Trump can’t touch with his budget. Social Security costs totaled about $910 billion last year, and Medicare outpaced defense spending with a total cost of $588 billion. Medicaid, interest payments on debt and miscellaneous costs made up an additional $1.2 trillion. \\n  \\n White House officials declined to answer questions about the president’s priorities on a host of other fiscal issues, including infrastructure improvements and plans to pay for a wall between the United States and Mexico. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), emphasized that the priorities outlined Monday do not reflect policy on broader fiscal issues, which he said will be addressed later. \\n  \\n “We are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars,” Mulvaney told reporters. “A full budget will contain the entire spectrum of what the president has proposed.” \\n  \\n (Reuters) \\n  \\n Defense spending accounts for almost the same proportion of the federal budget as all non-discretionary domestic spending, meaning that the Trump administration’s proposal will result in a roughly 10 percent across-the-board cut in all other federal spending programs. \\n  \\n Budgets for most federal agencies would be reduced substantially, said an OMB official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on a call with reporters to discuss the proposal. \\n  \\n The announcement marks the beginning of a process in which the OMB will coordinate with agencies to flesh out the plan. \\n  \\n Trump said his budget, which will be submitted to Congress next month, will propose “historic” increases in spending to bolster the country’s “depleted military,” and he said it will support law enforcement in an effort to reduce crime. \\n  \\n [Trump team plans for infrastructure ‘task force’ to advance top spending priority] \\n  \\n Trump noted that the country faces an urgent infrastructure problem, which he promised during the campaign that he would address with a $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan. Although the administration has not yet outlined whether infrastructure will be part of Trump’s budget proposal, the president spoke about it at length before a gathering of governors at the White House on Monday. \\n  \\n “We’re going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure,” he said. “We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads.” \\n  \\n He added: “Infrastructure, we’re going to start spending on infrastructure — big.” \\n  \\n Republicans in Congress expect that the details released this week will be the first elements of a broader budget that will be rolled out next month. The Trump administration is expected to release a pared-down “skinny budget” the week of March 13 and a fuller list of requests by the end of March or early April, said multiple Republican congressional aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the process. \\n  \\n Democrats have warned that under the current circumstances, Trump would be hard-pressed to make significant cuts to domestic programs without significantly reducing some government services. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that the scant details the Trump administration released probably would lead to cuts to widely used programs. \\n  \\n “A cut this steep almost certainly means cuts to agencies that protect consumers from Wall Street excess and protect clean air and water,” Schumer said. \\n  \\n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) added that deep reductions could have a major effect on programs that keep the American workforce competitive. \\n  \\n “A $54 billion cut will do far-reaching and long-lasting damage to our ability to meet the needs of the American people and win the jobs of the future,” she said in a statement. “The President is surrendering America’s leadership in innovation, education, science and clean energy.” \\n  \\n Individual agencies were expected to begin the customary process of sending budget requests for the upcoming fiscal year to the White House beginning Monday, the aides said.

Trump has said his budget will not include cuts to Medicare or Social Security, the usual targets of Republicans trying to trim federal spending. \\n  \\n Story Continued Below \\n  \\n “This budget follows through on my promise of keeping America safe, keeping out terrorists, keeping out criminals and putting violent offenders behind bars or removing them from our country altogether,” he said. \\n  \\n The White House has not yet defined the depth of cuts to particular programs. But some targets, such as the EPA, are in the cross-hairs of conservative groups that want severe reductions in programs such as the Obama administration's climate initiatives. \\n  \\n OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said Monday afternoon the Trump administration’s fiscal 2018 budget would include $462 billion in domestic funding and $603 billion in defense spending. \\n  \\n The proposed defense total is a $54 billion increase above the Budget Control Act spending caps for defense. Mulvaney called it one of the “largest increases in history.” \\n  \\n But the Obama administration also proposed a defense budget that busted the spending caps in fiscal 2018, and defense hawks in Congress were not happy with Monday’s announcement. \\n  \\n “Such a budget request would represent an increase of $18.5 billion above the level proposed by President Obama for fiscal year 2018,” Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in a statement. “In other words, President Trump intends to submit a defense budget that is a mere 3 percent above President Obama’s defense budget, which has left our military underfunded, undersized, and unready to confront threats to our national security.” \\n  \\n McCain and House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) have proposed a defense budget of $640 billion for fiscal 2018. \\n  \\n Trump said the proposed increase in military spending “will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government.” He didn’t offer specifics, though he pointed to recent attempts to negotiate military contracts, adding, “We cut the hell out of the prices.” \\n  \\n OMB officials declined to comment on how hard the funding reductions would hit the EPA, which now has an $8.1 billion budget. But they did note the proposal would conform to Trump’s campaign pledges to take an ax to the agency. (The president promised on the campaign trail to \\"get rid of it in almost every form,\\" leaving only \\"little tidbits left.\\") \\n  \\n Foreign aid, which makes up about 1 percent of the federal budget, will also be heavily targeted. “This budget expects the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding in the past,” an OMB official said. \\n  \\n The president said he would “substantially” increase spending to law enforcement, on the local and federal levels, blasting violent crime in urban areas like Chicago. \\n  \\n The Trump administration has not said how much money it will ask Congress to spend in total, or from where the cuts would come. Administration officials have said Trump’s budget blueprint will not touch entitlement programs or other mandatory spending, which makes up about two-thirds of federal spending each year. \\n  \\n Trump hinted that he would provide some additional details in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, when he is expected to lay out his priorities for his first year. \\n  \\n The White House will propose a full budget “later in the year,” but the budget “blueprint” agencies will now work on is expected by mid-March, the OMB officials said. \\n  \\n Trump hinted that budget would adhere to fiscal standards, in line with previous remarks from close advisers like OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. \\n  \\n “With the $20 trillion in debt, the government must learn to tighten its belt,” Trump said. \\n  \\n But he also made clear he planned to stick with his big-ticket agenda items like infrastructure. \\n  \\n Lamenting the state of the nation’s roads, bridges and tunnels, Trump promised massive investments nationwide. \\n  \\n “We’re going to take care of that.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) \\n  \\n WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says President Donald Trump's upcoming budget will propose a whopping $54 billion increase in defense spending and impose corresponding cuts to domestic programs and foreign aid. The result is that Trump's initial budget wouldn't dent budget deficits projected to run about $500 billion. \\n  \\n White House budget officials outlined the information during a telephone call with reporters given on condition of anonymity. The budget officials on the call ignored requests to put the briefing on the record, even though Trump on Friday decried the use of anonymous sources by the media. \\n  \\n Trump's defense budget and spending levels for domestic agency operating budgets will be revealed in a partial submission to Congress next month, with proposals on taxes and other programs coming later. \\n  \\n The big, approximately 10 percent increase for the Pentagon would fulfill a Trump campaign promise to build up the military. The senior budget office official said there will be a large reduction in foreign aid and that most domestic agencies will have to absorb cuts. He did not offer details, but the administration is likely to go after longtime Republican targets like the Environmental Protection Agency. \\n  \\n Tentative proposals for the 2018 budget year that begins Oct. 1 are being sent to agencies, which will have a chance to propose changes to the cuts as part of a longstanding tradition at the budget office. \\n  \\n Trump's budget, once finalized and sent to Congress in mid-March, is sure to set off a huge Washington battle. Democrats and some Republicans are certain to resist the cuts to domestic agencies, and any legislation to implement them would have to overcome a filibuster threat by Senate Democrats. A government shutdown is a real possibility. \\n  \\n Trump's budget also won't make significant changes to Social Security or Medicare, according to an administration official. \\n  \\n Capitol Hill aides confirmed details of the upcoming blueprint on the condition of anonymity to discuss information that's not yet been made public. \\n  \\n Trump's first major fiscal marker will land in the agencies one day before his first address to a joint session of Congress. For Trump, the primetime speech is an opportunity to refocus his young presidency on the core economic issues that were a centerpiece of his White House run. \\n  \\n The upcoming submission covers the budget year starting on Oct. 1. But first there's an April 28 deadline to finish up the unfinished spending bills for the ongoing 2017 budget year, which is almost half over, and any stumble or protracted battle could risk a government shutdown then as well. \\n  \\n The March release is also expected to include an immediate infusion of 2017 cash for the Pentagon that's expected to register about $20 billion or so and contain the first wave of funding for Trump's promised border wall and other initiatives like hiring immigration agents. \\n  \\n The president previewed a boost in military spending during a speech Friday to conservative activists, pledging \\"one of the greatest build-ups in American history.\\" \\n  \\n \\"We will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before,\\" he said. \\n  \\n In an interview with Fox News Channel's \\"Sunday Morning Futures,\\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said cuts to Social Security and Medicare would not be part of the administration's first budget. Trump's priority is passing legislation to reduce middle-class and corporate taxes, he said. \\n  \\n As a candidate, Trump promised to leave major entitlements untouched, breaking with some Republican leaders who believe the costly programs need to be reformed. \\n  \\n The White House budget office issued a statement confirming that an interim budget submission will be released in mid-March but declining to comment on an \\"internal discussion.\\" \\n  \\n \\"The president and his Cabinet are working collaboratively to create a budget that keeps the president's promises to secure the country and restore fiscal sanity to how we spend American taxpayers' money,\\" said Office of Management and Budget spokesman John Czwartacki. \\n  \\n Czwartacki said that the March submission would only address agency operating budgets funded by Congress and that proposals on tax reform and so-called mandatory programs — they include food stamps, student loans, health programs and farm subsidies — will be released later. \\n  \\n By increasing defense and leaving Medicare and Social Security untouched, the Trump final budget plan is sure to project sizable deficits. In the campaign Trump promised huge tax cuts but top GOP leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin don't want this year's tax reform drive to add to the budget deficit. |||||\\n\\nWrite a summary.","response":"President Trump plans to propose a federal budget that would increase defense spending by $54 billion while cutting federal agencies by the same amount, according to an administration official. The proposal represents a 10 percent increase in the already $603 billion defense budget focusing on national security, while other priorities, including foreign aid, would receive significant reductions. The move has been met with resistance by those concerned that significant cuts to domestic programs would affect education, infrastructure, and government services."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Process: - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption.

First off, Ang Lee i think tries WAY too hard to make movies with good storylines too big. Paycheck was a good movie, but he tried to make it way too emotional, instead he gets a two dimensional image of a good actor.

A more comprehensive and detailed answer would be as follows:\\n\\nThe expense of live singing can be attributed to multiple factors arising from the increasingly complex and high-quality production values that have become an essential part of modern live performances. These factors may include enhanced visual and audio elements, highly athletic dancing, and the use of advanced technology, all of which have the potential to impact the quality of live singing.\\n\\nOne of the most significant expenses of live singing comes from the elaborate stage productions that have become a norm in the entertainment industry. Shows by iconic artists like Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson have set new standards for showmanship. These concerts showcase breathtaking visual elements, such as intricate stage designs, elaborate costumes, and precision-timed pyrotechnics, which, while stunning, can potentially affect live performances due to their complexity and requirement of extensive preparation and rehearsals.\\n\\nFurthermore, live performances have evolved to incorporate highly athletic dancing routines. As artists' dedication to delivering visually spectacular performances has grown, the intricate and intense choreography has become a staple of many modern live concerts. This heightened emphasis on dance can lead to artists lip-syncing as they execute these physically demanding routines, as it becomes challenging to maintain a high standard of vocal performance while also delivering flawless dance moves. This trade-off comes at the expense of live singing, a fact that some fans may find disappointing.\\n\\nAdditionally, the increasing use of technology in live performances brings both significant benefits and challenges. On the one hand, advanced audio systems, lighting, and special effects can enhance the overall experience for the audience, creating a memorable event. On the other hand, the reliance on technology can also hinder live singing. The use of pre-recorded tracks, vocal effects, and auto-tune may impair the purity and authenticity of the artist's live vocal performance, leading to debates on the ethics of such practices in live performances.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the expense of live singing can be attributed to several factors, such as elaborate stage productions, highly athletic dancing, and the use of technology. While these developments contribute to creating visually stunning and memorable live performances, they can also detract from the authenticity and quality of live singing, as artists may opt to lip-sync or use technological aids to maintain a seamless performance in the face of increasing physical and logistical demands on stage."},{"question":"what does cch stand for in law enforcement??","response":"CCH stands for \\"Computerized Criminal History\\" in law enforcement.

Later on in the twentieth century these eventually gave way to stores such as Felix B. Maduro, Sarah Panamá, Figali, Danté, Sears, Gran Morrison and smaller ones such as Bon Bini, Cocos, El Lider, Piccolo and Clubman among others. Of these only Felix B. Maduro (usually referred to as Felix by locals) and Danté remain strong. All the others have either folded or declined although Cocos has managed to secure a good position in the market.\\n\\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How did Panama's department stores originally end? ","response":"It is not possible to provide a single definitive answer to how Panama's department stores originally ended, as each store's decline or closure may have resulted from various factors. However, some common reasons that could have contributed to the end of several Panamanian department stores include:\\n\\n1. Economic Factors: Economic downturns, recessions, or financial crises may have negatively impacted the profits and financial health of many department stores, making it difficult for them to sustain their operations. Businesses often close or downsize when they can no longer generate enough revenue to cover their operating costs.\\n\\n2. Competition: The rise of modern shopping malls, supermarkets, and big-box retail stores could have lured customers away from traditional department stores, leading to a decline in foot traffic and sales. Additionally, the emergence of online shopping and e-commerce platforms may have further exacerbated this issue, as consumers increasingly turn to the internet for their shopping needs.\\n\\n3. Inability to Adapt: Some department stores might have failed to adapt to changing consumer preferences and retail trends. This could include not offering the products or services that customers desire or not adopting the latest technologies to improve the shopping experience. Stores that fail to evolve in response to such shifts in the market can lose their competitive edge and ultimately close down.\\n\\n4. Mismanagement: Poor business decisions, financial mismanagement, or lack of strong leadership can also contribute to the decline and eventual closure of a department store. Businesses that are not well-managed or have inefficient operating systems are more likely to face financial struggles and fail.\\n\\n5. Mergers and Acquisitions: Some of the department stores may not have ended operations but instead were acquired or merged with other businesses. This could mean that they no longer exist as independent entities but have been absorbed into larger corporations or have had their brand names replaced.\\n\\nIn conclusion, several factors could have contributed to the end of Panama's department stores. These might include economic issues, increased competition, an inability to adapt to changing market demands, mismanagement, or mergers and acquisitions. Each department store's decline or closure would have been influenced by a unique combination of these factors, making it impossible to provide a single, overarching answer."},{"question":"Available options: I. The Center Kingdom II. not enough information III. Silver's Drey IV. The mountains\\nGiven those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.
