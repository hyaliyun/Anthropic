Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort. Although I’m one of the few people in the developed world who does not watch Game of Thrones, my co-workers tell me this was one of the locations used for a scene in the show.

Hirata's parents died there seven years ago, and the seven year death anniversary is a significant event in Japanese culture. Hirata must perform a ceremony in the river where they died after drowning in an avalanche – the drowned must be fed by the surviving family members if they are to find peace. Hirata goes to Iceland – to Reykjavík. His final destination is a remote river on the far side of the island. He encounters one mishap and misadventure after another. He first accidentally gets on a wrong bus filled with German tourists traveling to see the hot springs. He also confronts a language barrier; Hirata cannot speak any Icelandic, and knows very little English. After his first day's misadventures, Hirata decides to purchase an ancient, bright red Citroën DS to make the journey. During the long drive, Hirata meets several strange people along the way. These include the mystical woman who sells him the car, that only plays one radio station. Next, Hirata meets a local woman who collects photographs of funerals. The following day, Hirata meets two American hitchhiker/fugitives (Lili Taylor and Fisher Stevens), who turn out to be armed and dangerous who proceed to steal his car.

Understand the entities mentioned: Somali National Alliance and Battle of Mogadishu.\\n2. Research their relationship.\\n3. Explain the connection between them.\\n\\nStep 1: Understanding the entities\\n- Somali National Alliance (SNA) was a political and military coalition formed in the early 1990s in Somalia. It was led by Mohamed Farrah Aidid, an influential Somali general and faction leader during the Somali Civil War.\\n- Battle of Mogadishu was a military confrontation that took place in 1993 between U.S. and UN forces and Somali militiamen, primarily those loyal to Aidid.\\n\\nStep 2: Research their relationship\\nThe relationship between the SNA and the Battle of Mogadishu lies in their connection to the complex political and military events that occurred in Somalia during the early 1990s. The activities of the SNA and its leader, Aidid, played a significant role in the events leading up to the Battle of Mogadishu.\\n\\nStep 3: Explain the connection between them\\nThe SNA and the Battle of Mogadishu are related because the SNA was one of the key Somali factions involved in the conflict. The Battle of Mogadishu was an attempt by the United States and the UN to capture General Aidid and weaken his control over the city of Mogadishu. The operation, however, turned into a deadly urban battle, with both U.S. and Somali casualties. The SNA, under Aidid's command, played a crucial role in resisting the U.S. and UN forces and amplified the challenges faced during the Battle of Mogadishu.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu are related through their involvement in the same complex political and military events during the Somali Civil War, particularly as the SNA faction and its leader, Mohamed Farrah Aidid, were significant factors in the events leading to the Battle of Mogadishu."},{"question":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: A.F.C.

Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of different regions traded among themselves in the Pre-Columbian Era, but Europeans participated in the trade beginning from the time of their arrival in the New World and extended its reach to Europe. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada in the 17th century, and the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland. The 19th-century North American fur trade, when the industry was at its peak of economic importance, involved the development of elaborate trade networks.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, more organized violence than in previous decades occurred between the Native Americans involved in the deerskin trade and white settlers, most famously the Yamasee War. This uprising of Indians against fur traders almost wiped out the European colonists in the southeast. The British promoted competition between tribes, and sold guns to both Creeks and Cherokees. This competition sprang out of the slave demand in the southeast - tribes would raid each other and sell prisoners into the slave trade of the colonizers. France tried to outlaw these raids because their allies, the Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Yazoos, bore the brunt of the slave trade. Guns and other modern weapons were essential trading items for the Native Americans to protect themselves from slave raids; motivation which drove the intensity of the deerksin trade. The need for Indian slaves decreased as African slaves began to be imported in larger quantities, and the focus returned to deerskins. The drive for Indian slaves also was diminished after the Yamasee War to avoid future uprisings.  The Yamasees had collected extensive debt in the first decade of the 1700s due to buying manufactured goods on credit from traders, and then not being able to produce enough deerskins to pay the debt later in the year. Indians who were not able to pay their debt were often enslaved. The practice of enslavement extended to the wives and children of the Yamasees in debt as well. This process frustrated the Yamasees and other tribes, who lodged complaints against the deceitful credit-loaning scheme traders had enforced, along with methods of cheating or trade. The Yamasees were a coastal tribe in the area that is now known as South Carolina, and most of the white-tailed deer herds had moved inland for the better environment. The Yamasees rose up against the English in South Carolina, and soon other tribes joined them, creating combatants from almost every nation in the South. The British were able to defeat the Indian coalition with help from the Cherokees, cementing a pre-existing trade partnership.  After the uprisings, the Native Americans returned to making alliances with the European powers, using political savvy to get the best deals by playing the three nations off each other. The Creeks were particularly good at manipulation - they had begun trading with South Carolina in the last years of the 17th century and became a trusted deerskin provider. The Creeks were already a wealthy tribe due to their control over the most valuable hunting lands, especially when compared to the impoverished Cherokees. Due to allying with the British during the Yamasee War, the Cherokees lacked Indian trading partners and could not break with Britain to negotiate with France or Spain.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Were any other furs besides deer fur important during this time?","response":"The provided information does not specifically mention other types of furs being important during this time.

The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks in guest roles. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield.\\n\\nFor inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff referenced a poster featuring more than 320 Simpsons characters. Groening said they tried to include every single character in the film, with 98 having speaking parts, and most members of the crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people. The series' regular voice actors: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer, as well as semi-regular performers Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor, and Karl Wiedergott, reprised their roles. Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, while Albert Brooks, who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was hired as Russ Cargill, after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film. For \\"about a week\\", he was to reprise the role of Hank Scorpio, but when the character was omitted from the film, he ended up voicing Cargill.  The cast did the first of three table readings in May 2005, and began recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production. James L. Brooks directed them for the first time since the television show's early seasons. Castellaneta found the recording sessions \\"more intense\\" than recording the television series, and \\"more emotionally dramatic\\". Some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving the voice cast exhausted.  The writers had written the opening concert scene without a specific band in mind. Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call. Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides the voice of the father in the \\"new Grand Canyon\\" commercial with Hanks. Due to time restraints, several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film. Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut. Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt the voice was too distracting, so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice. Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos, but their scenes were cut. Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points, but these scenes were also cut. Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star.  Although he does not provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States rather than then-President George W. Bush because, according to Groening, \\"in two years ... the film [would be] out of date\\". Brooks was nervous about the idea, noting that \\"[Schwarzenegger's] opinion polls were way down\\", and has said that they \\"were [hoping] he'd make a political comeback\\". The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger, but one of the staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainer Wolfcastle as President. This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle, himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger, being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle.\\n\\nwere there other famous voices that are not on the regular show?","response":"Yes, there were other famous voices that are not part of the regular show.

Lauderdale, Florida, she adopted the stage name Paige O'Hara to pay homage to her grandmother's Irish roots.\\n\\nPaige O'Hara, a Broadway actress and singer at the time, initially auditioned for the role in 1989 and was later cast as the voice of Belle. Her casting was based on a combination of her singing ability, her Broadway experience, and her warm and empathetic voice. The film's directors, Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, felt that her voice conveyed the intelligence, wit, and empathy that Belle's character required. Paige O'Hara went on to receive a Disney Legend award in 2011 for her contributions to the Disney legacy.\\n\\nThe character of Belle is known for her assertive, intelligent, and kind-hearted nature. As the film's heroine, she is unique among Disney princesses in that she values her autonomy and desires more than a traditional lifestyle. Her creative spirit and determination are what captivated audiences and made her an enduring role model for young girls.\\n\\nWhile Paige O'Hara is best known for voicing Belle, it is important to mention that she also provided the speaking voice for Belle in Disney's sequels, \\"Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas\\" (1997) and \\"Belle's Magical World\\" (1998).

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet.

Fitting the collar:\\n\\nEnsure that the collar is fitted correctly on your pet. It should be snug, but not too tight, as it can cause discomfort or irritation. You should be able to fit two fingers between the collar and your pet's neck. Remember to regularly check the collar's fit, especially when your pet is growing or if it gains or loses weight.\\n\\n2. Attach pet's ID tags:\\n\\nAttach the pet's identification tags to the collar in a secure manner, ensuring that they are not too close to the pager mechanism to avoid interference. These tags should include your pet's name, your phone number, address, and any other relevant information that could be helpful in case your pet gets lost or needs assistance.\\n\\n3. Test the pager collar:\\n\\nBefore letting your pet wear the collar outdoors, test the pager collar to ensure it is functioning correctly. Press the activation button on the remote control, and the collar should respond with a light, sound, or vibration to alert your pet. It is crucial to familiarize your pet with these alerts by rewarding it with treats or affection when it responds correctly.\\n\\n4. Training your pet using the pager collar:\\n\\nTo train your pet using the pager collar, first, teach it to associate the collar's sound, light, or vibration with a command or desired action. For instance, if you want your dog to come to you when you activate the collar, activate the collar and give the command \\"come\\" simultaneously. When your pet responds correctly, provide positive reinforcement (such as treats, petting, or verbal praise).\\n\\nRepeat the process multiple times, gradually extending the distance between you and your pet, until it can consistently respond to your commands from various distances.\\n\\nIt is essential to remain patient and consistent during the training process and avoid using the pager collar as a form of punishment.\\n\\n5. Monitoring your pet:\\n\\nUse the pager collar to monitor your pet's whereabouts, especially in open spaces where it might wander off. Activate the collar's signal if you lose sight of your pet or need to call it back to you.\\n\\n6. Adjusting the collar settings:\\n\\nMany pager collars come with adjustable settings for the sound, light, or vibration intensity. Be sure to choose the appropriate settings for your pet's size, breed, and temperament. You may need to modify the settings as your pet becomes better trained or grows older.\\n\\n7. Battery and maintenance checks:\\n\\nPeriodically check the collar's battery to ensure it is working correctly and replace it when necessary. Additionally, keep the collar clean and well-maintained to avoid malfunctions or discomfort for your pet.\\n\\n8. Safety precautions:\\n\\nNever leave your pet unsupervised while wearing the pager collar, as it may pose a choking hazard or cause injury if caught on an object.

I was looking for my \\"Lady and the Tramp meatball moment.\\"   Instead, I came away underwhelmed.   I believe much of my issues stem from the prix fixe menu that was available, but there were other problems as well.   The service was average at best. I forget our servers name, but she rattled off the entrees, brought us our bread, and then expected us to order. We were both a little shocked. Personally, I felt rushed all evening and I had to work against the servers to slow the evening down.   The ambience was less than ideal. Italian music played oh-so-faintly in the background. The lights were up all the way. No candles on any of the tables. We at least got the wine glasses promptly (though the provided wine key had a really loose hinge), though our wine was so-so (a custom labeled zinfandel I had got from a different place. Great label, average wine).   These issues were important to setting the mood for the evening, but we still had to eat. I had high expectations for the food, especially given the large number of very positive reviews from other Yelpers. However, the food did not live up to expectations.   The gnocchi I ordered was pillowy soft, exactly the way it's supposed to be, with wonderfully flavorful sauce. Alli's dish, a chicken piccata, was long on chicken, short of pasta, and the lemon sauce was only okay. In short, the presentation needed work.   Again, I think the problems with the food stemmed from the prix fixe menu. Under normal circumstances, I'm sure Ristorante Guiseppe serves wonderful, authentic, full-blooded Italian food, but this time, the experience felt rushed, cheap, and quick. In summation: not the Valentine's Day ambience one is trying to create.  I am very willing to give it another shot, but I would not recommend Ristorante Guiseppe for a special occasion.\\nHow would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","response":"This review can be described as having mixed sentiment leaning toward negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the service, ambiance, and some aspects of the food, particularly on their special occasion.

It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.) Watching the shower of golden pine needles drift down from the redwoods whilst I typed out a blog post, I enjoyed seeing squirrels scamper and birds twitter their way around the boughs and branches.

The term \\"laser\\" originated as an acronym for \\"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light \\"coherently\\". Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond.  - Geomorphology (from Ancient Greek: , \\"gê\\", \\"earth\\"; , \\"morph\\", \\"form\\"; and , \\"lógos\\", \\"study\\") is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of topographic and bathymetric features created by physical, chemical or biological processes operating at or near the Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and numerical modeling. Geomorphologists work within disciplines such as physical geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archaeology and geotechnical engineering. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.  - Forestry is the science and craft of creating, managing, using, conserving, and repairing forests and associated resources to meet desired goals, needs, and values for human and environment benefits. Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands. The science of forestry has elements that belong to the biological, physical, social, political and managerial sciences.  - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.  - Laser guidance directs a robotic system to a target position by means of a laser beam. The laser guidance of a robot is accomplished by projecting a laser light, image processing and communication to improve the accuracy of guidance. The key idea is to show goal positions to the robot by laser light projection instead of communicating them numerically. This intuitive interface simplifies directing the robot while the visual feedback improves the positioning accuracy and allows for implicit localization. The guidance system may serve also as a mediator for cooperative multiple robots. Examples of proof-of-concept experiments of directing a robot by a laser pointer are shown on video. Laser guidance spans areas of robotics, computer vision, user interface, video games, communication and smart home technologies.   - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\".  - In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-, and gamma radiation.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - Stimulated emission is the process by which an incoming photon of a specific frequency can interact with an excited atomic electron (or other excited molecular state), causing it to drop to a lower energy level. The liberated energy transfers to the electromagnetic field, creating a new photon with a phase, frequency, polarization, and direction of travel that are all identical to the photons of the incident wave. This is in contrast to spontaneous emission, which occurs at random intervals without regard to the ambient electromagnetic field.  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.  - Geodesy,  also known as geodetics, geodetic engineering or geodetics engineering  a branch of applied mathematics and earth sciences, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the Earth (or any planet), including its gravitational field, in a three-dimensional time-varying space. Geodesists also study geodynamical phenomena such as crustal motion, tides, and polar motion. For this they design global and national control networks, using space and terrestrial techniques while relying on datums and coordinate systems.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - Seismology (from Ancient Greek  (\\"seismós\\") meaning \\"earthquake\\" and - (\\"-logía\\") meaning \\"study of\\") is the scientific study of earthquakes and the propagation of elastic waves through the Earth or through other planet-like bodies. The field also includes studies of earthquake environmental effects such as tsunamis as well as diverse seismic sources such as volcanic, tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric, and artificial processes such as explosions. A related field that uses geology to infer information regarding past earthquakes is paleoseismology. A recording of earth motion as a function of time is called a seismogram. A seismologist is a scientist who does research in seismology.  - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  - A portmanteau (; plural \\"portmanteaus\\" or \\"portmanteaux\\" ) or portmanteau word is a linguistic blend of words, in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word.  as in \\"smog\\", coined by blending \\"smoke\\" and \\"fog\\", or \\"popportunity\\", from \\"popping\\" and \\"opportunity\\", or \\"motel\\", from \\"motor\\" and \\"hotel\\". In linguistics, a portmanteau is defined as a single morph that represents two or more morphemes.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - In modern engineering, the term laser scanning is used with two related, but separate meanings. The first, more general, meaning is the controlled deflection of laser beams, visible or invisible. Scanned laser beams are used in some 3-D printers, in rapid prototyping, in machines for material processing, in laser engraving machines, in ophtalmological laser systems for the treatment of presbyopia, in confocal microscopy, in laser printers, in laser shows, in Laser TV, in ceramic laser treatments, and in barcode scanners.  - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec.

The name \\"lidar\\", sometimes considered an acronym of \\"Light Detection And Ranging\\" (sometimes \\"Light Imaging, Detection, And Ranging\\"), was originally a portmanteau of \\"light\\" and \\"radar\\". Lidar is popularly used to make high-resolution maps, with applications in geodesy, geomatics, archaeology, geography, geology, geomorphology, seismology, forestry, atmospheric physics, laser guidance, airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM), and laser altimetry. Lidar sometimes is called \\"laser scanning\\" and \\"3D scanning\\", with terrestrial, airborne, and mobile applications.  - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.  - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters.  - Surveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional position of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish land maps and boundaries for ownership, locations like building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.  - Arthur Leonard Schawlow (May 5, 1921  April 28, 1999) was an American physicist. He shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.  - Geology (from the Ancient Greek , \\"g\\", i.e. \\"earth\\" and -o, \\"-logia\\", i.e. \\"study of, discourse\\") is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars).  - Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials would involve a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.  - In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium. This includes:  - Atmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the atmosphere. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model Earth's atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations, chemical models, radiation budget, and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere (as well as how these tie into other systems such as the oceans). In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory, wave propagation models, cloud physics, statistical mechanics and spatial statistics which are highly mathematical and related to physics. It has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including remote sensing instruments.

Having grown up in a family that prioritized financial education, Leslie had developed a keen understanding of investment strategies and market dynamics. Robert, on the other hand, was good at earning money but lacked the expertise needed to make the most informed choices about where to invest it.\\n\\nStep 1: Introduce the characters' backgrounds\\nBefore continuing the story, it's important to establish who the characters are, their motivations, and their backgrounds. This can help create a more immersive and believable story for the reader.\\n\\nRobert had always been passionate about his career as a software engineer, working long hours, and taking on challenging projects to boost his income. Although he had accumulated a sizable fortune over time, he had never truly focused on managing his finances. Leslie, meanwhile, had majored in finance and had worked as a financial analyst for five years before deciding to become a freelance financial advisor, giving her the flexibility to pursue her other passions, like writing.\\n\\nStep 2: Present the problem\\nNow that the two characters' backgrounds have been established, it's necessary to introduce a problem or conflict that they must overcome together.\\n\\nOne day, Robert checked his investment accounts and realized that they were severely underperforming in comparison to market indices. Concerned about his financial future, he decided he needed Leslie's help to grow and diversify his investment portfolio.\\n\\nStep 3: Show them working together\\nWith the problem presented, it's time to show Robert and Leslie collaborating to solve it. This can be used to further develop their relationship and present opportunities for growth and learning.\\n\\nLeslie started by carefully reviewing Robert's current investments and was surprised to see that the majority of his funds were concentrated in a handful of tech stocks. Despite being an expert in tech, Robert had inadvertently neglected the importance of diversification. Leslie explained the benefits of spreading investments across various sectors and asset classes to minimize risk and potentially achieve more long-term growth.\\n\\nStep 4: Introduce new challenges\\nThrow in some challenges that force the characters to adapt or think creatively to test their skills, providing the reader with excitement and new insights.\\n\\nAs Leslie dug deeper, she also noticed some discrepancies in Robert's investment accounts. Upon closer investigation, she discovered that a few unauthorized transactions had been made, causing a significant loss to Robert's overall earnings. Alarmed by this discovery, the duo realized that Robert's online account had been compromised and they needed to take immediate action to prevent any further damage.\\n\\nStep 5: Resolution\\nLastly, wrap up the story by showing how the characters overcame their problems and what they've learned from the experience.\\n\\nWorking diligently together, Leslie helped Robert secure his investment accounts, recoup some of his losses, and redesign his portfolio to better align with his goals, values, and risk tolerance. As they collaborated, Robert gained valuable insights into personal finance, while Leslie was able to sharpen her crisis management skills. The experience forged a strong bond between the two friends, with Robert vowing to prioritize financial education and Leslie coming to appreciate the importance of remaining vigilant even in the digital age. Both now felt better equipped for the uncertainties of the financial world, and looked forward to navigating its complexities together."},{"question":"Here is a premise:\\ncourse i'm tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but it's a lot of fun and it's it's a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you don't realize you're getting exercise you know it's so much fun you don't really think about it\\n\\nHere is a hypothesis:\\nIt is a fun and good way to exercise.\\n\\nHere are the options: OPTIONS: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no;\\nIs it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?\\n","response":"(A). yes\\n\\nExplanation: In the premise, it is mentioned that \\"it's a lot of fun and it's a good way to get exercise.\\" This statement directly supports the hypothesis that \\"It is a fun and good way to exercise.\\" Therefore, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true.\\n\\n(B) is wrong because the premise clearly states it as fun and a good way to exercise.\\n(C) is wrong because the statement provides evidence that supports the hypothesis, not contradicting it."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said.

This zinc coating provides the object with enhanced corrosion protection, ensuring its longevity, enhancing its appearance, and reducing maintenance requirements. The sherardized coating is achieved through a diffusion process, which involves heating the material in a closed container along with zinc powder.\\n\\nThe origin of sherardizing dates back to the early 1900s when metallurgist Sherard Osborn Cowper-Coles developed this unique method for corrosion protection. Sherardizing is also known as vapor galvanizing, dry galvanizing, or diffusion galvanizing. It is commonly used in industries such as automotive, construction, aerospace, and in the manufacture of various machine parts and tools.\\n\\nThe sherardizing process begins with the cleaning and preparation of the object to be coated. This includes removing any existing coatings, rust, grease, scale, or other contaminants that could interfere with the formation of a solid bond between the zinc and the base material. After cleaning, the object is placed inside a sealed, temperature-controlled rotary drum along with zinc powder. \\n\\nThe drum is then heated to a temperature range of approximately 380°C to 450°C (716°F to 842°F) for a specific period, typically between 1 to 8 hours, depending on the desired thickness of the coating and the type of material being coated. The zinc powder inside the drum vaporizes and diffuses into the surface of the object, forming an iron-zinc alloy layer as the drum rotates. This iron-zinc alloy layer provides enhanced corrosion resistance and helps to maintain the mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility, of the base material.\\n\\nOnce the sherardizing process is complete, the object is cooled slowly to prevent the coating from cracking or peeling. The object can then be post-treated to improve specific characteristics and performance. This may include passivation, sealing, or applying a topcoat such as paint or powder coating to increase the level of corrosion protection and enhance the appearance of the object.\\n\\nThe main advantages of sherardizing include:\\n\\n1. Uniform coverage and thickness: The sherardizing process allows for an even and consistent zinc coating over the entire surface of the object, including hard-to-reach areas and complex geometries.\\n\\n2. Enhanced corrosion resistance: The iron-zinc alloy layer formed during the process offers superior barrier protection from corrosion when compared to other zinc coating methods, such as hot-dip galvanizing or electroplating.\\n\\n3. Improved mechanical properties: The diffusion process used in sherardizing helps to maintain the mechanical properties of the base material, thus preserving its strength and ductility.\\n\\n4. Environmentally friendly: Sherardizing involves fewer chemicals and produces fewer pollutants when compared to other galvanizing methods. \\n\\n5. Increased wear and abrasion resistance: The zinc-iron alloy coating formed through sherardizing offers improved resistance to wear and abrasion when compared to other methods.\\n\\nIn summary, sherardizing is a coating process in which an object, typically made of steel or other ferrous materials, is coated with a protective layer of zinc. This process entails heating the object in a sealed container along with zinc powder to create a chemically bonded, corrosion-resistant iron-zinc alloy layer. The resulting sherardized coating offers enhanced corrosion resistance, improved mechanical properties, and an even, uniform coverage perfect for various applications in different industries."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?\\nSitting and sleeping are mutually exclusive activities.

The context clues provided allow us to analyze the presented options and narrow down the best possible answer.\\n\\nA gymnasium typically hosts indoor sports, such as basketball, volleyball, or gymnastics. Hooligans, who are characteristically rowdy and aggressive, are not associated with these sports, rendering this option less likely.\\n\\nA baseball stadium might experience moments of excitement, but the nature of the game tends to be less aggressive, and the pace is often slower compared to other sports. Hooligans are not typically found at baseball games, and using smoke bombs is highly unusual in this environment, making this an unlikely answer.\\n\\nA soccer game is a plausible answer since hooliganism has been historically associated with soccer matches, especially in certain parts of Europe. The intense loyalty and rivalries between soccer clubs make these events notoriously contentious, often breeding aggressive behavior from a minority of their fans. Smoke bombs are also not uncommon in soccer games, specifically in connection with hooliganism.\\n\\nA sports match is a vague option that could include any of the above and additional sports. Although it would not be incorrect, the other alternatives provide a better opportunity for specificity.\\n\\nLastly, a football stadium does witness enthusiastic fan behavior, but hooligans are not as prevalent as in soccer games. Additionally, the use of smoke bombs is an uncommon occurrence in football games.\\n\\nTaking all of this into consideration, the most appropriate answer to the question is \\"soccer game\\" as it is the environment with the strongest ties to hooliganism, chant disruptions, and the use of smoke bombs."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

It's difficult to look back on one's own childhood without some element of nostalgia .I have four brothers and sisters, and my memories are all about being with them.Playing board games on the living room floor, or spending days in the street with the other neighborhood children, racing up and down on our bikes, or exploring the nearby woods.My parents scarcely appear in these memories, except as providers either of meals or of severe blame after some particularly risky adventure. These days, in the UK at least, the nature of childhood has changed dramatically.Firstly, families are smaller, and there are far more only children.It is common for both parents to work outside the home and there is the feeling that there just isn't time to bring up a large family, or that no one could possibly afford to have more than one child.As a result, today's boys and girls spend much of their time alone.Another major change is that youngsters today tend to spend a huge amount of their free time at home, inside.More than anything this is due to the fact that parents worry far more than they used to about real or imagined dangers, so they wouldn't dream of letting their children play outside by themselves. Finally, the kind of toys children have and the way they play is totally different.Computer and video games have replaced the board games and more interesting activities of my childhood.The irony  is that so many ways of playing games are called \\"interactive\\".The fact that you can play electronic games on your own further increases the sense of loneliness felt by many young people today. Do these changes mean that children today have a less relaxing childhood than I had? I personally believe that they do, but perhaps every generation feels exactly the same. Which is NOT a reason for the changes? A) Families are smaller today B) Toys can be played by children alone at home C) It's too dangerous to play outside D) Parents worried too much about their children\\nA:","response":"D) Parents worried too much about their children"},{"question":"Process:  - Bacteria enter the body - Bacteria start to divide and grow - The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells - Other cells cannot function properly - We feel unwell - The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins - Toxins harm the body - The body tries to react to the toxins - The body&#x27;s natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell.

The refugees seem to have shown a significant interest in participating in the 2004 Afghan presidential election by registering in large numbers, despite the threats and warnings from radical groups. This determination to vote highlights their commitment to contributing to the future of their country and the democratic process.\\n\\nThe situation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan is critical due to the long-lasting conflict and instability in Afghanistan. Many Afghans have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries, such as Pakistan and Iran. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there were around 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan in 2004.\\n\\nThe 2004 Afghan presidential election was a significant event in the country's history as it marked the first direct presidential election since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. The election was part of the political transition process laid out by the 2001 Bonn Agreement, which aimed to establish a new democratic government in Afghanistan. The agreement also set the foundation for a new Afghan constitution, which was adopted in January 2004.\\n\\nThe election took place on October 9, 2004, and resulted in Hamid Karzai, who had served as interim president since December 2001, being elected as the president of Afghanistan. Karzai's victory in the elections, along with the adoption of the new constitution earlier in the year, marked a significant milestone in Afghanistan's journey toward democracy.\\n\\nAllowing Afghan refugees living in Pakistan to register and vote in the election was important for several reasons. First, it ensured that the voices of a large number of Afghans who were living outside their home country were not overlooked in the political process. Including refugees in the democratic process is essential for building sustainable peace and development in Afghanistan. Second, it demonstrated to the international community that Afghanistan was making progress in its transition to democracy, which could lead to increased international support and investment in the country.\\n\\nHowever, the process of refugee participation in the Afghan elections was not without its challenges. Many refugees faced intimidation and threats from Islamic militants who opposed the election and the democratic process. These threats were mainly targeted towards those working at registration centers and those who registered to vote. Despite these challenges, the fact that nearly three-quarters of a million Afghan refugees registered to vote indicates their resilience and determination to contribute to the future of their country.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Afghan refugees in Pakistan had shown considerable courage and commitment to contribute to the development of a new democratic Afghanistan by participating in their country's first direct presidential election in 2004. Despite facing numerous challenges and threats from Islamic militants, a significant number of refugees still registered to vote, demonstrating their desire for peace, stability, and a brighter future for Afghanistan. This participation played an essential role in shaping the country's political landscape and is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Afghan people."},{"question":"Q: Context: Early Netherlandish painting is the work of artists, sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives, active in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands during the 15th-and 16th-century Northern Renaissance; especially in the flourishing cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Louvain, Tournai and Brussels, all in contemporary Belgium. Their work follows the International Gothic style and begins approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the early 1420s. It lasts at least until the death of Gerard David in 1523, although many scholars extend it to the start of the Dutch Revolt in 1566 or 1568 (Max J. Friedländer's acclaimed surveys run through Pieter Bruegel the Elder). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but is seen as an independent artistic culture, separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy. Because these painters represent the culmination of the northern European medieval artistic heritage and the incorporation of Renaissance ideals, they are sometimes categorised as belonging to both the Early Renaissance and Late Gothic.\\n\\nQuestion: who was one of the first artist to use the netherlandish style of painting?\\nLet's give stream of consciousness below\\n","response":"To find the answer to the question, let's break down the information given in the context:\\n\\n1. \\"Early Netherlandish painting is the work of artists, sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives, active in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands during the 15th-and 16th-century Northern Renaissance.\\"\\n2. \\"Their work follows the International Gothic style and begins approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the early 1420s.\\"\\n\\nFrom these two points, it becomes clear that the Netherlandish style of painting emerged during the 15th and 16th centuries, in the context of the Northern Renaissance.

The context specifically states that the Soyuz spacecraft is of Russian origin. Let's analyze the context further for a better understanding:\\n\\n1. The context mentions \\"Russian Soyuz spacecraft,\\" which directly states the spacecraft's nationality and type. Soyuz is a well-known brand of Russian spacecraft designed by the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. It has been in use since the 1960s and has a proven track record of successful launches and missions.\\n\\n2. The location of the spacecraft's departure, Baikonur Cosmodrome, is significant. This cosmodrome is situated in Kazakhstan, just a few hundred kilometers from the Russian border, and it is the world's oldest and largest operational space launch facility. Historically, Baikonur Cosmodrome has had a strong connection with the Russian space program, having served as the primary launch site for Soviet and later Russian space missions. The current Russian space agency, Roscosmos, and the Russian Aerospace Forces both use this facility.\\n\\n3. The fact that the spacecraft completed a two-day flight from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to the International Space Station (ISS) indicates that it was a crewed or uncrewed mission with a specific goal. The ISS is a cooperative space endeavor between various international space agencies, including the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Russia has been one of the major contributors to the ISS since its inception, providing Soyuz spacecraft for crew transport and supply missions.\\n\\nConsidering these points, it is reasonable to draw the hypothesis that the spacecraft in the given context was Russian.

One such scientist, Dylan, suddenly begins to become manipulated by an invisible force, which creates a scene to the guests and drags the scientist into the nearby bathroom and proceeds to brutally beat and throw Dylan around the room.

Though he does not know how to make more, Dylan mentions that another scientist, Maggie Dalton (Laura Regan), knows the formula. Seemingly accepting this, the invisible man releases Dylan and tells him not to tell anyone he was here, to which he agrees. No sooner has he left, than Dylan attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man, who only pretended to leave to see if Dylan would stay silent, smashes the phone on the ground, and slashes Dylan's neck with the broken circuit board, killing him.The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct an investigation, but the military supervisor of the laboratory, Colonel Gavin Bishop (William MacDonald), insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction over the crime, and refuses to relent even when one of the detectives, Frank Turner (Peter Facinelli), points out that they have no experience conducting a proper criminal investigation.Fearing another attack on the remaining scientists, the lab company owner, Dr. William Reisner (David McIlwraith), employs Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez (Sarah Deakins), to protect Maggie (despite the military forcing the police out of the investigation), but refuses to divulge any information to the detectives on the nature of the work they are doing, which includes refusing to tell them that an invisible killer is on the loose.Turner and Lisa, after gaining Maggie's reluctant cooperation,...\\nAnswer:","response":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"question":"Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to $10 from $5 and in circuit court to $20 from $10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is $50.50, and in circuit court $108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about $1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said. \\n\\nQuestion: \\"Who made the following remark: ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away.\\"\\"\\n\\nResponse: \\"Hamon\\"\\nSelect from the following.

(CBSNewYork/AP) — A New Jersey police chief was looking back Thursday on his efforts to save a suicidal woman thousands of miles away in Italy. \\n  \\n As CBS2’s Meg Baker reported, the woman he saved gave thanks in an email several days later. \\n  \\n An email form a concerned friend of the woman in Verona, Italy, mistakenly ended up in the inbox for the police department in Verona, New Jersey. \\n  \\n But that did not stop Chief of Police Mitchell Stern. \\n  \\n Stern said the department received the email on Thursday, April 14 from a Chinese student in the United Kingdom. He was concerned about another Chinese student at the Verona Academy of Fine Arts in Italy. \\n  \\n “He was conversing on a chat app — a messaging app — with another Chinese student, female, in Verona — and that she was in process of possibly committing suicide,” Stern said. \\n  \\n Stern figured out that the friend was trying to contact the police department in Verona, Italy, and not the department for his Essex County, New Jersey township. But he still stepped into action, knowing that time was of the essence. \\n  \\n He could not get through to the Verona, Italy police department, so he tried the Italian embassy in New York. It was after hours, so Stern then called New Jersey State Police and was able to find a contact at Interpol in Washington, D.C. \\n  \\n That contact in turn sent the desperate message to Interpol in Italy. \\n  \\n “Ultimately, the Italian state police responded to assist this young woman,” Stern said. “She had taken some pills and she had attempted to hurt herself physical. They transported her to hospital.” \\n  \\n On Tuesday, the woman – who survived thanks to the chief’s relentless calls for help – wrote him an email. Stern read it out loud to CBS2’s Baker. \\n  \\n “I am the girl from China who got saved by you, now in Verona, Italy,” the email read. “Though we don’t know each other before, you did really help me a lot. I believe there is millions of people like you. The lucky thing is that I have a chance to write this letter to you and say thank you. No wonder I begin to enjoy everything around me. Life is brilliant.” \\n  \\n All Verona, New Jersey officers get special training to deal with delicate circumstances such as the ones Stern encountered. \\n  \\n “We go to multiple in service classes to familiarize ourselves with situations like this, and he did a good job remembering his training,” said Verona police Officer Brendan Huber. \\n  \\n Stern was humble about his own role. \\n  \\n “It’s great that I helped with this, but I also want to remember; everybody needs to remember – that it wasn’t just me. It was everybody from the start, including girl who had the courage to tell her friend, and then her friend who emailed me,” he said. \\n  \\n The chief said his department had a similar situation in town just last week, and that this is not just a tale of two Veronas. He said someone in your town may be seeking help as well. \\n  \\n The chief asked that anyone with thoughts of harming themselves take time to talk with someone – a friend, a counselor, or even your local chief of police. \\n  \\n (TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

The key areas where this cooperation has the potential to make a significant impact include trade, investment, and economic growth. Here, we will discuss the benefits of this collaboration in more detail, as well as the ways in which it stimulates the allocation of resources towards future investments in both Argentina and other Latin American countries.\\n\\nFirst, the cooperation between Argentina and the European Union leads to greater trade possibilities and opportunities. By working closely together, both parties can benefit from the exchange of valuable goods and services. This cooperation facilitates the reduction of trade barriers and tariffs, which ultimately broadens the market for businesses and entrepreneurs in both regions. In turn, this expanded market enables greater exposure to a diverse range of products and services, fostering innovation and the growth of new industries.\\n\\nSecond, the partnership between the two parties encourages increased investment in both regions. The involvement of the European Union provides a level of financial stability and access to resources for Argentine businesses and entrepreneurs. This stability allows for added confidence in the market, which, in turn, leads to the attraction of more diverse investment opportunities from both local and foreign investors. Additionally, the European Union's financial support opens up the opportunity for collaborations and joint ventures between Argentinian and European businesses, ultimately bringing about further economic development in Argentina and Latin America.\\n\\nLastly, this cooperation between Argentina and the European Union facilitates economic growth in both regions. The exchange of expertise, knowledge, and resources allows for a positive transfer of skills and practices that contribute to sustainable development. It is important to note that this growth is not limited to Argentina alone – this collaboration also benefits the Latin American region as a whole. The progress made by Argentina can serve as a blueprint for other Latin American countries, encouraging similar steps for further economic and societal development.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the cooperation between Argentina and the European Union presents an array of benefits, including greater trade possibilities, an increased flow of investments, and the enhancement of economic growth for both sides. This collaboration not only serves to strengthen ties between the two parties but also presents numerous opportunities for Argentinians and other Latin Americans to allocate more resources towards future investments, driving progress and development throughout the region."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: \\"I believe you're the right person to write an advice column for the students called \\"Dear Amy!\\".

Given the two facts above, what can help prevent hypothermia?\\nAnswer:","response":"Given the two facts above, using insulated clothing and materials can help prevent hypothermia. By wearing well-insulated garments, such as thermal clothing, warm layers, and waterproof outerwear, you can effectively trap body heat and maintain warmth, thus reducing the risk of experiencing a dangerous drop in body temperature. Additionally, keeping dry by avoiding wet clothing and wet environments is essential to prevent heat loss, as water conducts heat away from the body faster than air does. In summary, dressing in insulated, warm, and dry clothing is crucial to prevent hypothermia."},{"question":"Write a negative movie review.","response":"Title: \\"Oblivion of Creativity\\"\\n\\nOblivion, a 2013 science fiction film starring the renowned Tom Cruise and directed by Joseph Kosinski, can best be characterized as a vast, inundating wasteland of wasted potential. The movie postures as an intellectual sci-fi film while exhibiting a disappointing lack of originality and creativity, proving itself to be a compilation of borrowed ideas rather than a unique contribution to the genre.\\n\\nFrom the onset, the film presents itself as a profound, mystical venture into a dystopian future, banking heavily on the charisma of its lead actor, Tom Cruise. Cruise, despite his commendable efforts, is unable to single-handedly carry the convoluted storyline and compensate for the glaring absence of a well-rounded ensemble cast. Moreover, his character, Jack Harper, is as deep as a puddle after a brief drizzle. The lackluster character development throughout the film creates an unfortunate emotional disconnect between the characters and the audience, leaving us numb towards their trials and eventual outcomes.\\n\\nThe movie's plot, while seemingly intriguing, is heavily laden with clichéd science fiction tropes and predictability. The overarching themes of big brother, lost memory, and alien warfare are recycled with little to no innovation. The narrative structure is draped in false complexity which unravels down to simplicity in the most unrewarding of ways. Even the supposed plot twists and climaxes are foreshadowed too heavily, making the reveal less of extraordinary and more of a ritual in motion.\\n\\nThe visual effects, though visually pleasing, fail to compensate for the poor storytelling. While the post-apocalyptic vistas and high-tech gadgetry provide some level of aesthetic allure, it is not enough to be the film's saving grace. The overwhelming over-reliance on CGI and vast panoramic shots of destruction and desolation only serve to distract from the disjointed plot rather than enhance it.\\n\\nAs for the dialogue, it seems to have been written on autopilot. Lackluster and often borderline ludicrous, the movie’s script seriously underutilizes the acting prowess of both Cruise and co-star Olga Kurylenko. Attempts at emotional depth and connection via dialogue fell flat and were overshadowed by overproduced action sequences.\\n\\nMoreover, \\"Oblivion\\" falls tragically short in the music department as well. The score is every bit a non-entity as the film itself, offering nothing new or innovative to engage the viewer. M83, despite their exceptional talent in producing evocative and immersive soundscapes, fails to breathe life into this motion picture with their compositions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Kosinski's \\"Oblivion\\" is an empty vessel that looks pretty from a distance, but upon closer inspection, it lacks a soul. The movie is a maelstrom of missed opportunities, unexplored plot tangents, and underdeveloped characters. Its meandering storyline, coupled with a lack of originality, makes the film a forgettable addition to the plethora of far superior science fiction offerings out there. It is perhaps a classic case of style over substance, with its grand visuals not enough to save it from the oblivion it unfortunately descends into."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Hubie deduces that having had their fill of 2000 lifetimes worth of cheese, there's no reason to go on living.After leaving a note, the two go into a residential home, and try to get the cat there to eat them. When the cat refuses, they try everything from pleading to bullying, which does nothing but frighten the cat.After being driven to the end of his rope, the cat leaves a note, and heads out to end his life. Finding a dog, he provokes it and pleads to be 'massacred.' The dog finds this perplexing that a cat would so willingly want to die.As they talk, the dog sees the two mice accost the cat, and try to get him to eat them, with the cat refusing. The dog then asks the cat if he likes to eat mice, and is met with a 'no.'

One Florida woman thinks so. \\n  \\n In what her lawyer said is a first-of-its-kind case, Melanie Beacham, of St. Petersburg, Fla., filed a complaint against MarkOne Financial, LLC, alleging that employees of the Jacksonville, Fla.-based company harassed her and her family members over Facebook to intimidate her into paying an alleged debt. \\n  \\n In papers filed with a Florida court, citing violations of state consumer protection law, Beacham is asking for damages as well as court intervention to stop MarkOne Financial from using the social network to contact her and her relatives. \\n  \\n \\"This is a huge invasion of privacy,\\" said Billy Howard, Beacham's attorney. \\"It's important to send a message to other debt collectors that this type of invasion of privacy will not be tolerated by America. …Other people need to know that their rights are being violated by debt collectors when they are contacting friends and family members on Facebook.\\" \\n  \\n In a statement, MarkOne Financial said it does not comment on pending litigation, but added, \\"We firmly believe that the facts will demonstrate that the harassment allegations made against us are false, and that we have and do operate within the spirit and scope of the law.\\" \\n  \\n Woman Claims Debt Collector Contacted Her Sister, Cousin on Facebook \\n  \\n The company said that its policy is to use Facebook to locate customers when the customer has a fully public profile and when he or she has not responded to requests through \\"conventional means.\\" \\n  \\n Howard said Beacham fell behind on car payments after taking medical leave from work. He said she contacted MarkOne to explain her circumstances but collectors started calling her, up to ten times a day. \\n  \\n Later, Beacham learned that the company contacted her sister and cousin via Facebook, Howard said, adding that it's possible that other friends and family members were also contacted. \\n  \\n \\"For an individual to know where you are and how to contact you, and then to be contacting you through Facebook, your family and friends through Facebook, it's a clear instance of harassment,\\" he said. \\n  \\n Expert: Debt Collection Industry Needs Debate About Social Media \\n  \\n According to Beacham's complaint, MarkOne \\"intentionally harassed and abused the Plaintiff in outrageous format\\" in July, when a representative contacted two of Beacham's acquaintances on Facebook, asking them to call him. \\n  \\n A screengrab of the Facebook communication included with the complaint shows the representative writing: \\"Please Have Melanie D Beacham call me\\" and included his phone number. Howard said Beacham's sister deleted the message from MarkOne. \\n  \\n The original complaint was filed in August, but the motion to enjoin MarkOne from using Facebook to contact Beacham was added this month. Howard said MarkOne had not yet responded to the suit. \\n  \\n David Cherner, legal counsel and director of state government affairs for the Association of Credit and Collection Professionals, said that legal issues surrounding the usage of Facebook in debt collection are somewhat vague because the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) was written decades ago, long before the advent of social media. \\n  \\n \\"There are certain ambiguities in the law that create risks for debt collectors to communicate with consumers in certain ways,\\" he said. \\"There needs to be debate about modernizing the law so that consumers can be communicated with how they choose.\\" \\n  \\n Regardless of what kind of medium debt collectors use to reach consumers, Cherner said, they are prohibited from revealing information to third parties and cannot make false, deceptive, misleading or harassing representations. \\n  \\n When debt collectors use social media, they need to understand how they are going to be using it and for what purpose, he said, because it can be a risky practice. \\n  \\n \\"I think there certainly needs to be a broader debate about communications with consumers,\\" he said. \\"The FDCPA was enacted so long ago and consumers communicate in so many ways and, not only that, but they want to be communicated with in so many ways.\\" ||||| A Florida woman claims a debt collector went far beyond the usual phone calls in an attempt to recoup $362 for an unpaid car loan by sending her messages on Facebook _ and by telling family on the social networking site to have her call the agency. \\n  \\n Melanie Beacham, who is suing the debt collection agency Mark One LLC in a Florida court, said she never expected to hear from a collection agency on Facebook, which she used to talk to loved ones and post the occasional photo or funny status update. \\n  \\n \\"I was shocked when I found out these collectors used Facebook to contact my family because they knew exactly where I was,\\" Beacham, 34, told The Associated Press in an e-mail on Thursday. \\"I'm angry they caused me so much embarrassment with my family.\\" \\n  \\n Beacham's attorney, Billy Howard of the Morgan and Morgan law firm in Tampa, said the debt collectors violated Beacham's privacy and Florida's consumer protection law, which prohibits collectors from harassing people. Beacham filed the lawsuit in August, though updated court papers were filed Thursday. \\n  \\n \\"It's an invasion of privacy on steroids,\\" Howard said. \\"Normally, it takes a while for collection agencies to contact family members or friends, or co-workers, but on Facebook you have a very powerful harassment tool at your fingertips.\\" \\n  \\n The lawsuit also claims that Mark One contacted Beacham six to 10 times a day by phone, sent her a text message, contacted her neighbor and sent a courier to deliver a letter to her workplace. Beacham's attorney has asked a judge to prohibit Mark One from contacting her or her family through Facebook or Twitter. \\n  \\n Beacham at one point took the license plate off her car, telling the debt collector in a text message to just take it away and stop contacting her, according to court documents. \\n  \\n In a statement sent Thursday, the collection agency said it will not discuss Beacham's case and denied any wrongdoing. But the company acknowledged that its collectors use Facebook to find people when they don't respond to other means, like letters and phone calls. \\n  \\n Beacham's case won't be heard in court until January, but it underscores how seemingly private information becomes quite public on the Internet. \\n  \\n \\"The reality is that debt collectors, law firms, private investigators _ you can come up with a long list of people _ are using Facebook as well as geo location networks such as Gowalla and Foursquare to track people down,\\" said Amy Webb, the CEO of the Baltimore-based Webbmedia Group, an international digital media consulting firm. \\"They can contact people through their connections and ultimately collect a debt or get incriminating information.\\" \\n  \\n U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who along with Republican Sen. George LeMieux has introduced a bill aimed at curbing harassment from debt collectors, said he wasn't surprised to hear of cases like Beacham's. \\n  \\n \\"Unscrupulous debt collectors are using every tool at their disposal to make a buck, sometimes targeting the wrong person, going after debts that have already been collected, or harassing family members,\\" Franken said Thursday. \\n  \\n Howard said his office has gotten more than a dozen complaints similar to Beacham's, and said recently debt collectors have started to use such sites more often. \\n  \\n Jeffrey Hyslip, a Chicago lawyer, said he had one client who was friended on Facebook by a young woman in a bikini. The account turned out to be a debt collector's, something his client realized only when the \\"friend\\" posted a message on his wall: \\"Pay your debts, you deadbeat.\\" \\n  \\n Beacham's lawsuit's states that one of her family members received a Facebook message from a Mark One representative identifying himself as Jeff Happenstance. \\n  \\n \\"Please Have Melanie D Beacham call me ... Thanks,\\" the message said. \\n  \\n The family member replied by suggesting the person contact Beacham himself. \\n  \\n Hyslip said that kind of exchange could be a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which states that collection agencies are only allowed to contact third parties to confirm someone's location. |||||\\nWhat is a summary?","response":"Melanie Beacham, a Florida woman, filed a complaint against MarkOne Financial, a debt collection agency, for allegedly harassing her and her family on Facebook over an unpaid car loan.

The son studied really hard.\\n2. The cause of the high grade is directly attributed to studying hard.\\n\\nBoth sentences discuss the relationship between studying hard and getting a high grade. The key difference between the two sentences is the direction of reasoning.\\n\\nIn Sentence A, the direction of logic is reversed, as it assumes that the high grade is the reason for hard studying. In essence, it suggests that because the son got a high grade, he must have studied hard. However, this reasoning may not always hold true, as there could be other factors contributing to a high grade, such as natural talent, luck, or receiving assistance from others. It also is a possible logical fallacy (post hoc ergo propter hoc) by assuming that because the high grade followed the hard studying, the studying must be the cause of the high grade.\\n\\nIn Sentence B, the direction of logic is more straightforward, stating that because the son studied hard, it is the cause for the high grade. While not guaranteed, it is a more natural correlation to assume studying hard leads to better grades.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, Sentence A does not make as much sense as Sentence B; since it is inferring the cause of studying hard in a potentially flawed manner, while Sentence B provides a more direct link between studying hard and achieving a high grade."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: forest, moss, stump","response":"Once upon a time in a magical forest, there was a stump covered in soft, green moss where little creatures played."},{"question":"Given the question: What type of details about patrick k. gamble  can be gathered from the following bio?

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

It is governed as part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, of which the main island, Saint Helena, is around to the southeast. The territory also includes the sparsely populated Tristan da Cunha archipelago, some to the south, about halfway to the Antarctic Circle.  - Tristan da Cunha, colloquially Tristan, is the name of both a remote group of volcanic islands in the south Atlantic Ocean and the main island of that group. It is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, lying from the nearest inhabited land, Saint Helena, and from the nearest continental land, South Africa. It is from South America. The territory consists of the main island, named Tristan da Cunha, which has a northsouth length of and an area of , along with the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible and Gough islands. As of January 2017, the main island has 262 permanent inhabitants. Meanwhile, the other islands are uninhabited, except for the personnel of a weather station on Gough Island.  - Queen Mary 's Peak is the summit of the island of Tristan da Cunha , in the South Atlantic Ocean . It has an elevation of 2,062 metres ( 6,765 ft ) above sea level . It is named after Mary of Teck , the Queen consort of King George V. It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha . The mountain is the peak of the massive shield volcano which forms the island . A 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) wide summit crater caps the peak , and it contains a heart - shaped crater lake . This lake is normally frozen during the winter , and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow . The only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a vent on the north shore of the island . The island community had to be evacuated . Queen Mary 's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid . In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan . In 2004 , Ellen MacArthur sighted the Peak on her record - breaking circumnavigation of the world .  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Mary of Teck (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867  24 March 1953) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King-Emperor George V.  - Saint Helena is a volcanic tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of Rio de Janeiro and west of the Cunene River, which marks the border between Namibia and Angola in southwestern Africa.

In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers.

Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe.

Select from options: Read this fact: \\"Earth is made of rock\\"\\n\\nNow answer this question: \\"Earth is a similar material as\\"\\n\\nChoose from: (I). Mars (II). Jupiter (III). Neptune (IV). the sun","response":"Earth is a similar material as (I). Mars.\\n\\nBoth Earth and Mars are classified as terrestrial planets, meaning that they are primarily composed of rock and metal. These planets have similar constituent materials and are made up of a solid surface with a core, mantle, and crust. The primary difference between the two lies in their size, composition, and geological activity.\\n\\nIn terms of size, Earth is roughly twice the diameter of Mars and has a significantly higher mass and density. This difference in mass and density contributes to Earth's stronger gravitational pull and thicker atmosphere.\\n\\nOne of the key similarities in material composition between Earth and Mars is the presence of silicate rock, which forms the majority of their crusts. Furthermore, both planets have metallic cores that are primarily composed of iron and some nickel, though the exact proportion is still not well known for Mars. Additionally, both planets appear to have some water locked in their crusts, with growing evidence suggesting that Mars may have once had a significant water presence on its surface.\\n\\nIn terms of geological activity, Earth is more geologically active than Mars. Earth's crust is divided into a series of tectonic plates that move and interact, leading to earthquakes and volcanic activity. On Mars, volcanic activity has been observed, but there is currently no direct evidence of tectonic plate movement. Some theories suggest that Mars may have experienced some form of tectonic activity in the past, but further study is warranted.\\n\\nDespite these differences, the primary similarity in material composition between Earth and Mars classifies them as terrestrial planets and distinguishes them from gaseous planets such as Jupiter (II) and Neptune (III), which are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and the sun (IV), which primarily consists of hydrogen and some helium."},{"question":"The cast of the 1990s hit comedy, minus Matthew Perry, reunited on NBC's Tribute to James Burrows on Sunday.\\nThey reminisced during the two-hour tribute that featured clips from the respected director's roster of shows.\\nBut some Friends fans expressed disappointment, saying they had expected a new episode of the hit comedy show.\\nPerry, who played Chandler, did not attend the show due to rehearsals for his West End play, but did tape an introduction to his former co-stars.\\nJennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc all took part in the special.\\nStars from Burrows' other shows, such as Will & Grace and Cheers, were also there.\\nThe Friends cast started their stint on the sofa reminiscing about the many games of poker they played together off-screen, and offered titbits to host Andy Cohen about their time on the show, both on and off-screen.\\nCox revealed that she, Aniston and Kudrow ate lunch together for 10 years while filming the sitcom, eating the same salad, prepared by Aniston, every day.\\nAnd they revealed they were good friends away from the studio too, with Kudrow saying \\"we really wanted to connect\\" in real life.\\n\\"At the beginning it was not a hard thing, we really just wanted to hang out with each other, it was not 'ugh we have to do this',\\" said Aniston.\\n\\"We just really fell in love and adored each other instantly and would hang out at each others' houses and watch the show together.\\"\\nShe added: \\"We experienced friendship, family, heartbreak, babies, everything together.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued. \\n\\nChoose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What did the high-level effort to persuade Pakistan include?\\" is \\"President Clinton offered the moon in terms of better relations with the United States\\"?\\n\\npick from the following.\\n[A]. no;\\n[B]. yes;","response":"B. yes\\n\\nThe high-level effort to persuade Pakistan included President Clinton offering \\"the moon in terms of better relations with the United States\\" if Pakistan would help the U.S. get Bin Laden and deal with other issues.

The reasons for this may vary, but some factors could include the difference in circumstances surrounding each sinking, the emotional impact of surviving a second shipwreck, and the personal challenges faced during each disaster.\\n\\nThe Titanic disaster in 1912 is one of the most famous maritime tragedies in history, claiming the lives of more than 1,500 people. The ship's sinking was sudden and unexpected due to the collision with an iceberg, causing chaos and panic among passengers. This chaos was further exacerbated by the inadequate number of lifeboats on board, adding to the sense of desperation and fear.\\n\\nThe Rohilla sinking in 1914, on the other hand, was a result of the ship running aground in the North Sea near Whitby during a storm, leading to a devastating and prolonged ordeal for the passengers and crew. As the passengers and rescuers battled the stormy conditions and treacherous waters, many of those on board suffered horrific injuries and exposure to the elements. The rescue efforts took several days, and the death toll reached nearly 100 people.\\n\\nMary Roberts' experiences of both disasters likely differed significantly due to the unique circumstances of each event. The rapid sinking of the Titanic would have meant a more immediate need for escape, while the Rohilla disaster involved a more prolonged struggle for survival as the ship broke apart over several days.\\n\\nAdditionally, the emotional toll of surviving two shipwrecks within such a short period may have heightened the horror of the Rohilla sinking for Mary Roberts. The second disaster would have likely brought back traumatic memories of the Titanic sinking, as well as a deepening fear of not surviving another ordeal at sea. Living through another shipwreck would understandably be a traumatizing experience, likely leading Mary Roberts to view the Rohilla sinking as even worse than the Titanic ordeal.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Mary Roberts' statement that the Rohilla sinking was worse to endure than the Titanic disaster may be due to a combination of factors, such as the differing circumstances of each event, the emotional impact of facing a second maritime tragedy, and the difficult personal experiences endured throughout both disasters."},{"question":"Information:  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America.

Golf clubs are designed in a variety of shapes and sizes, catering to different types of shots and player preferences. They are an essential part of the game, enabling golfers to propel the golf ball towards the hole with precision and accuracy.\\n\\nA standard set of golf clubs consists of 14 clubs, each serving a specific purpose on the golf course. They are broadly classified into four main categories, namely woods, irons, wedges, and putters. Here is a detailed explanation of each type of club:\\n\\n1. Woods: These clubs are designed for hitting the ball over long distances, such as during tee shots on longer holes. Traditionally, they were made from hardwood, like persimmon, but modern woods are commonly constructed from various metals like titanium, steel, and other composite materials. The most well-known wood is the driver (also known as 1-wood), which has the largest clubhead and the least loft among woods, generating the maximum speed and distance.\\n\\n2. Irons: Irons are typically used for shots of varying lengths, from the tee box on shorter holes to an approach shot from the fairway to reach the green. These clubs have smaller, more compact, angled clubheads, and are typically numbered between 2-9, with the loft angle increasing from 2-iron, which has the least loft, to 9-iron, having the highest loft. Long irons (2, 3, and 4) are suitable for longer approach shots, mid irons (5, 6, and 7) are versatile and used for a broad range of shots, while short irons (8 and 9) are designed for higher, shorter shots offering more control and precision.\\n\\n3. Wedges: Wedges are a subset of irons that serve a specialized purpose. They are designed for short distance shots, typically to escape challenging situations, such as bunkers, or to achieve greater accuracy and control when approaching the green. Wedges have the highest loft angle among golf clubs, allowing the ball to be lifted quickly and land softly on the green. The common types of wedges include the pitching wedge, gap wedge, sand wedge, and lob wedge, each providing different loft and bounce characteristics.\\n\\n4. Putters: The putter is the most specialized golf club in a player's arsenal, used exclusively on or around the greens to finish the hole by rolling the golf ball into the cup. Putters come in various designs, including blade (or traditional) putters, mallet putters, and alignment-style putters, each offering different levels of balance, stability, and alignment aid to suit individual player preferences. The critical aspect of selecting a putter is finding a design that allows the golfer to feel comfortable and confident while addressing the ball and executing the putt.\\n\\nCustomization and fitting are important factors in selecting golf clubs. Each golfer has unique swing characteristics and abilities, making it essential to choose clubs that best suit individual needs and styles. Factors such as clubhead design, shaft flex, length, lie angle, and grip can significantly influence a player's performance on the course and should be carefully considered while selecting the appropriate golf clubs."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below:\\nAnn Rae Rule had several children\\n\\nAnn Rae Rule (née Stackhouse; October 22, 1931 – July 26, 2015) was an American true crime author of \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\", about serial killer, and Rule's co-worker, Ted Bundy.

Possible A: air port, repair shop, road, race track, freeway  Why is \\"road\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?\\n","response":"\\"Road\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most typical and appropriate place for cars to be driven and used. Here's a breakdown of why the other possible answers are not as closely aligned with common sense:\\n\\n1. Airport: While cars do go to and from airports for transportation purposes, an airport is not primarily designated for cars. Airports are mainly for airplanes and air travel. Cars are allowed only in specific zones such as parking lots and passenger pick-up/drop-off areas, which are relatively minor compared to the whole airport area.\\n\\n2. Repair shop: A repair shop is a place where cars are serviced or repaired, but it is not a location where cars are primarily operated or used. People take their cars to repair shops only when there is a mechanical issue, making it an occasional destination rather than the natural place for cars to be. \\n\\n3. Race track: A race track is a specific type of road designed for car racing or high-performance driving. Race tracks are not the usual environment for most cars, which are primarily used for transportation and commuting rather than for racing or high-speed activities. \\n\\n4. Freeway: Although a freeway is a type of road and may seem like a valid option, it is primarily designed for high-speed, long-distance travel. Freeways are not the main environment for cars in many regions, particularly urban and suburban areas, where local roads and streets enable cars to reach destinations more directly.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the answer \\"road\\" best aligns with human common sense because it is the most general and universal location where cars are operated and used for various purposes, including commuting, leisure, and transportation of goods. Roads are designed for all types of vehicles, and they are spread throughout cities and towns, making them the most natural and everyday place for cars to be."},{"question":"Translate to German:\\n\\nThe PXI-2533 breaks out switch connections into a single 68-pin SCSI connector.\\n\\nGerman:","response":"Der PXI-2533 führt die Schalterverbindungen in einen einzelnen 68-poligen SCSI-Anschluss aus.\\n\\nSteps for the translation:\\n1.

They anticipate that this program would encourage citizens to use bicycles as their primary mode of transportation for short trips instead of driving their cars. The local government is interested in understanding the possible implications of this program on the residents, the environment, and the existing transportation system.\\n\\nHypothesis: Implementing a free public bike-sharing program will lead to a significant reduction in private vehicle usage for short trips, thereby resulting in numerous social, environmental, and economic benefits for the town.\\n\\nTo explore this hypothesis in detail, it's important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this program:\\n\\n1. Environmental benefits:\\nBy encouraging bicycle use over private vehicles, the bike-sharing program would potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and noise pollution. This would improve air quality and contribute to the overall well-being of residents by offering a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation.\\n\\n2. Health benefits:\\nIncorporating cycling into daily routines would promote physical activity among residents, leading to associated health benefits such as improved cardiorespiratory fitness, weight management, and mental well-being. It could also help combat sedentary lifestyles and associated issues, such as obesity and heart disease.\\n\\n3. Economic benefits:\\nA bike-sharing program could lead to cost savings for residents, as cycling is considerably cheaper than maintaining and fueling a private vehicle. Furthermore, reduced vehicular traffic might result in lower road maintenance costs for the town. An increase in cycling could also stimulate local businesses by attracting tourists and improving access to commercial areas.\\n\\n4. Social benefits:\\nThe program could foster a sense of community among residents who share bicycles, participate in group cycling events, and interact more frequently in public spaces. It can also promote equity in transportation access by providing a low-cost option that is easily accessible to various demographics.\\n\\n5. Infrastructure considerations and challenges:\\nTo support the bike-sharing program, the town would need to invest in well-maintained cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes, parking facilities, and connectivity to public transportation. The local government would also need to consider the upfront costs of purchasing bicycles and establishing a user-friendly system for tracking and renting bikes.\\n\\n6. Possible drawbacks:\\nWhile the bike-sharing program is designed to reduce private vehicle usage, there may be concerns regarding theft or vandalism, user safety, and liability issues. Additionally, some residents may be hesitant to cycle due to existing personal habits, lack of confidence, or unfavorable weather conditions.\\n\\nTo evaluate whether the free public bike-sharing program will achieve the desired outcomes, the local government could conduct surveys among residents to assess their interest in and willingness to use the service. Pilot programs in select neighborhoods could also be introduced to gauge the success of the initiative and gather feedback for improvements.\\n\\nOverall, the hypothesis that implementing a free public bike-sharing program will lead to a significant reduction in private vehicle usage for short trips, thus promoting social, environmental, and economic benefits, hinges on effective implementation, infrastructure planning, and community engagement."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Ideally, he should be using clean hands and a sanitized space to avoid any contaminants or debris from getting into his eye. The contact lens should ideally be checked for any damages or imperfections before attempting insertion.\\n\\nOnce the contact lens is properly in place, the man should notice an improvement in his vision, depending on the prescription of the contact lenses. The contact lenses function to correct any refractive errors he might have, such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism, or presbyopia.\\n\\nHe should then proceed to insert the contact lens into the other eye, following the same clean and careful procedure. After successfully putting on both lenses, the man should briefly inspect his vision by focusing on both near and far objects to ensure that his vision has been corrected as intended. Any discomfort, blurriness, or irritation should be promptly addressed by readjusting the lenses or consulting an eye care professional.\\n\\nTo maintain good eye health, the man should follow a few simple steps. First, he should store his lenses in a clean, labeled container with fresh disinfecting lens solution and replace the solution daily. If the man is using daily disposable lenses, he should discard the lenses after each use to avoid infection.\\n\\nFurthermore, the man should establish and follow a consistent wearing schedule as recommended by his eye care professional. Contact lens wearers should avoid wearing contacts for longer durations than prescribed, as it can lead to discomfort and longer-term eye health issues, such as corneal neovascularization or ulcers.\\n\\nIn addition to proper lens care, the man should have regular check-ups with his optometrist or ophthalmologist to ensure his prescription remains accurate, and his eyes are in good health.

This is because the tilt results in more direct sunlight falling on that particular region, which in turn translates to more solar energy reaching its surface.\\n\\nThe Earth's axis is tilted approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun, causing the two hemispheres - Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere - to experience varying levels of sunlight and solar radiation throughout the year. As the Earth orbits around the sun, its tilt causes the hemispheres to receive different amounts of sunlight at different times. When one hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, it experiences summer with longer days and more direct sunlight, while the other hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and experiences winter with shorter days and less direct sunlight. This tilt and variations in the amount of sunlight is a major reason for the Earth having different seasons.\\n\\nWhile the other answer choices have some merit, such as receiving more sunlight, starlight, light, and photons, the fundamental factor is that the increased sunlight results in enhanced solar energy. Thus, the best answer is \\"Solar energy\\" as it encapsulates the underlying reason for the increase in light and warmth experienced by the region which is tilted towards the sun.\\n\\nThe answers \\"rainfall,\\" \\"moonlight,\\" and \\"pollution\\" are not directly related to the tilt of the Earth towards the sun, hence they are not the best choices in response to the question."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a text of the tweet and a corresponding label whether this tweet is 'Offensive', 'Hate Speech' or 'Neither'.

Rapid detection of MRSA-colonized patients has the potential to limit spread of the organism. We evaluated the sensitivities and specificities of MRSA detection by two molecular methods (IDI-MRSA PCR assay and GenoType MRSA Direct PCR assay) and three selective MRSA agars (MRSA ID, MRSASelect, and CHROMagar MRSA), using 205 (101 nasal, 52 groin, and 52 axillary samples) samples from consecutive known MRSA-infected and/or -colonized patients. All detection methods had higher MRSA detection rates for nasal swabs than for axillary and groin swabs. Detection of MRSA by IDI-MRSA was the most sensitive method, independent of the site (94% for nasal samples, 80% for nonnasal samples, and 90% overall). The sensitivities of the GenoType MRSA Direct assay and the MRSA ID, MRSASelect, and CHROMagar MRSA agars with nasal swabs were 70%, 72%, 68%, and 75%, respectively. All detection methods had high specificities (95 to 99%), independent of the swab site. Extended incubation for a further 24 h with selective MRSA agars increased the detection of MRSA, with a corresponding decline in specificity secondary to a significant increase in false-positive results.

Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming.

Her errant behavior prompts her frustrated boyfriend Tim to break up with her and evict her from their New York City apartment. Forced to move back to her hometown in New England (the fictional Mainhead), Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria; he brings her an old television set for her unfurnished house and offers her a job at the bar to help her, which Gloria accepts. Working at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. Each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian monster appears in Seoul, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and is able to remotely control the monster's movements, which mirror her own. Gloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends; however, when Oscar steps onto the playground, he causes a giant robot to appear in Seoul. Gloria ultimately tries to make amends by having the monster spell out an apology in Korean, to the delight of the South Koreans and the media, and begins to avoid both the playground and alcohol. After spending the night with Joel, Gloria discovers that a drunken Oscar is using the robot to taunt South Korea. After a tense confrontation, Gloria manages to make him leave. Oscar is jealous, believing that something happened between Gloria and Joel. Later that night at the bar, he drunkenly insults his friends and demands that Gloria drinks, then orders her to do so by threatening to return to the playground if she does not. The next morning, a sobered-up Oscar confesses his remorse and pleads with Gloria to forgive him. Gloria accepts his apology, but Oscar's controlling attitude becomes clear.

The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

Lewis's popular children's series, The Chronicles of Narnia, though it is chronologically the first book in the series regarding the events in the fictional world of Narnia. The novel tells the story of the origins of Narnia and how it was created by the great lion Aslan.\\n\\nThe events in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" take place at various times and settings due to the story's fantastical nature involving parallel universes and time travel. To help understand the timeline better, we can divide the story's events into different stages.\\n\\n1. London, England (circa late-1800s/early-1900s Earth time): The primary setting of the story in our world is in London, England, during the late Victorian or early Edwardian era. The young protagonists, Digory Kirke and Polly Plummer, are neighbors who discover magical rings created by Digory's Uncle Andrew. The events that unfold in London and at Uncle Andrew's house serve as the catalyst for the adventure that leads the children to explore other worlds.\\n\\n2. The Wood Between the Worlds (timeless): The children are transported to the Wood Between the Worlds, an enigmatic forest that contains numerous pools that serve as gateways to different worlds. This place is timeless and serves as a hub for traveling between worlds. The young adventurers jump into a pool and arrive in the dying world of Charn.\\n\\n3. Charn (unknown time): Charn is an ancient, dying world in its final stages of decay. Here, Digory and Polly inadvertently awaken the malevolent Queen Jadis, who ruthlessly ruled Charn and destroyed it using a powerful spell. With her reawakening, Jadis latches on to the children, traveling with them to Earth briefly, and later to Narnia.\\n\\n4. The creation of Narnia (Narnian year 0): Upon entering another pool in the Wood Between the Worlds, the children, Jadis, Uncle Andrew, and other characters from Earth, including a London cab driver named Frank and his horse Strawberry, find themselves in the nascent world of Narnia, witnessing its creation by Aslan. The events in Narnia take place approximately at the Narnian year 0 on the Narnian timeline, marking the beginning of Narnia's history. During the creation of this new world, many events occur that hold significance for the future of Narnia and the characters in the series.\\n\\n5. Return to London (circa late-1800s/early-1900s Earth time): At the conclusion of their adventures, the characters are sent back to their original time and place in London, England. The experiences they gained during the adventure help shape their futures and the destiny of Narnia.\\n\\nIn summary, \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" takes place at various times primarily in the late-1800s/early-1900s London, as well as the Wood Between the Worlds, Charn, and Narnia. The events that occur provide essential background and context to the entire Narnia series, making the book a pivotal component in understanding the origins and development of the fantastical world of Narnia."},{"question":"Question: Dialogue:  M: Can you believe I just had to pay 20 pounds for a hair cut in Steward?

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily.

If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

He would entertain his parents with magic shows, noting that his tricks would often fail humorously.\\nContext: Ogre's first collaboration with Al Jourgensen was in 1987 during the recording of the song \\"Show Me Your Spine\\" for the film RoboCop. The song was recorded by PTP, a side project of Jourgensen's alongside Ministry cohort Paul Barker. Jourgensen explained that he \\"didn't even know who he [Ogre] was, but somebody said he was some singer from somewhere, so I just said \\"hey man, make yourself useful, get in here and sing\\". Ogre would later go on tour with Ministry to promote their album The Land of Rape and Honey in 1988. Ogre asked Jourgensen if he would produce the 1989 Skinny Puppy album Rabies, a job he accepted. Jourgensen noted that there were \\"bad vibes\\" in studio since it had been Ogre, not Key and Goettel, who asked for assistance on the record; \\"Sometimes bad vibes make for great, tension-filled music, and that's what Skinny Puppy thrived on\\".  Ogre next worked with Jourgensen on the Ministry album The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste, receiving credit as a writer on the song \\"Thieves\\". Ogre introduced Jourgensen to Toronto native Angelina Lukacin whose voice was recorded for the album closer \\"Dream Song\\". Ogre joined Ministry on tour contributing guitars, keyboards, and vocals. He said that \\"Playing with Ministry was insane everywhere, especially during the tour for The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste, which had the cage set up at the front of the stage.

The single \\"Burning Inside\\" featured a live cover of the Skinny Puppy song \\"Smothered Hope\\", with Ogre contributing vocals.  Ogre had also worked with Jourgensen in the industrial group Revolting Cocks, originally as a touring member. Ogre mentioned that he \\"had a gas\\" while on tour, referring to it as an initiation; \\"My brain was rotating about four feet above my head\\". He continued to work with the group by providing vocals for their 1990 effort Beers, Steers, and Queers. However, Ogre declined the invitation to go on tour, noting that there were some tensions between Jourgensen and himself. \\"There were a few things that happened between me and him [Jourgensen] that really made me question our whole friendship and his reason for having me down there.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate.

The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot.  The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to  2 1/2 inches high.

Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa. Acting as her driver and lookout, Lisa escorts Sandra to the site of a drug deal that quickly goes sour when her buyer is revealed to be a Narcotics officer. Suspicious after Sandra's cool response to his earlier queries about a missing container in a recent shipment, Lester follows Sandra to the deal and accosts Lisa as she waits in the car. He sends Lisa away on his motorcycle and takes her place in the car. After Sandra emerges, Lester drives her away from the scene.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who ended up getting left behind? Movie plot title: Fast & Furious Movie plot: This fourth 'Fast and the Furious' film begins in the Dominican Republic. A semi truck pulling several fuel tankers drives by, followed by a black Buick GNX containing Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) and two older pickup trucks. Letty climbs onto the GNX's hood and hops onto the last fuel tanker while Dom pulls ahead of the semi and stays in front of it to keep it at a certain speed. The first pickup (driven by Han from the third film, 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift') does a perfect 180-degree U-turn and continues in reverse while his female occupant flips over a part of the truck and lands perfectly onto the hitch on the back of the last fuel tanker. Letty is already spraying the hitch connecting the fuel tankers to each other and smashes it with a hammer once it's frozen so the last two tankers become detached and eventually come to a stop. As the second pickup is preparing the same feat (with Dom talking to them on walkie-talkies, hinting that they're not particularly great at what they are doing), Letty is standing on top of one of the tankers, and the semi driver sees her in his rear view and begins to speed up, hitting the GNX. Things get a little hectic, and the second pickup is pretty much getting dragged since they pulled off the U-turn and are connected to the trailer hitch. Letty gets knocked off of her feet but hangs on, though her hammer falls. While driving alongside of her, Dom orders Letty to spray the hitch, despite her no longer having a hammer. He instead pulls a 180-degree turn with the rear end of his car hitting the tanker, which shatters the frozen hitch, though he is now driving in reverse. At this point, they are already heading downhill, and the semi driver jumps out with his pet lizard. The semi and its trailer detach as Dom urges Letty to jump, particularly because the road curves but the semi is rolled over onto its side and is blocking the road. She jumps, and he eventually stops in front of the flipped semi as the fuel tanker, flaming...\\nThe answer is:","response":"\\"No answer\\" \\n\\nJustification: Based on the provided movie plot, there is no specific character that got left behind.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Paragraph: Two mycologists studied about mushrooms. Bert studied mycorrhizal fungi, while Vince studied saprophytic mushrooms.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied a bit less about mineral nutrient absorption from the soil?\\nAnswer:","response":"Vince studied a bit less about mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. This is because he focused on studying saprophytic mushrooms, which are fungi that decompose dead organic matter and do not form mycorrhizal associations with plant roots. On the other hand, Bert studied mycorrhizal fungi, which have a direct relationship with plant roots and play a significant role in enhancing the plant's mineral nutrient absorption from the soil."},{"question":"What is the answer to this question? who has the most nba points in a game?\\n\\n","response":"The current record holder for the most points scored in a single NBA game is Wilt Chamberlain. He set this record on March 2, 1962, while playing for the Philadelphia Warriors in a game against the New York Knicks. During this historic game, Chamberlain scored 100 points, a feat that has yet to be surpassed in NBA history. This remarkable achievement is regarded as one of the greatest individual accomplishments in the world of professional sports.\\n\\nWilt Chamberlain was a dominant force in the NBA during his 14-year career from 1959 to 1973. Standing at 7 feet 1 inch tall, he was known for his exceptional scoring ability, and his 100-point game remains the pinnacle of these skills. Chamberlain achieved this incredible feat by shooting 36 field goals out of 63 attempts, 28 free throws out of 32 attempts, and pulling down 25 rebounds.\\n\\nTo provide some context for this accomplishment, the second-highest point total in a single NBA game is held by Kobe Bryant, who scored 81 points for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Toronto Raptors on January 22, 2006. Other notable single-game scoring achievements include David Thompson's 73 points in 1978, David Robinson's 71 points in 1994, and Elgin Baylor's 71 points in 1960.\\n\\nIt is important to note that basketball has evolved over the years, and players today play differently than they did during Chamberlain's time. The implementation of the three-point line in the 1979-80 NBA season, along with changes in defensive strategies and game flow, has influenced the way players score.\\n\\nDespite these changes and the various talented players who have graced the NBA since Chamberlain's 100-point record, no one has been able to surpass his remarkable achievement. It is difficult to predict if or when this record will ever be broken, but as of now, Wilt Chamberlain remains the king of NBA single-game scoring with his historic 100-point game."},{"question":"Context: The 2010 United States Census reported that Marin County had a population of 252,409.

However, we all know that this is never quite the case, no matter how much we try, we cannot break free from the past.\\" Read more: David Bowie returns with new single, album. In that sense it's an unbeatable image. Bowie's glittering reputation rests on his determination, during his extraordinary run of albums in the 1970s, to escape the past and embrace the future, but he was also clever enough to realize that there's no such thing as an entirely blank slate, and that tension was the motor of his genius. The excitement surrounding his surprise comeback, after a decade of supposed retirement, reminds us that he is rock's unrivalled innovator-in-chief. His early reinventions could perhaps be explained by sheer ambition. That's why David Jones from suburban Bromley, on the southern outskirts of London, became David Bowie (rhymes with Zoe, not Maui) and then Bowie, fearing that 1969's \\"Space Oddity\\" would render him a one-hit wonder, became Ziggy Stardust, the first post-modern rock star. If fame was all he was looking for, he would have been happy with that, but his hunger for change exceeded his appetite for success. He killed off Ziggy after just 18 months and unveiled a series of new identities, each with its own sound. Photos: David Bowie's ever-changing look. To listen to all of Bowie's 70s albums in sequence is still a dizzying experience, because each one attempts to eclipse its predecessor. On \\"Aladdin Sane\\" he explored the relationship between showbusiness and mental illness. \\"Diamond Dogs\\" was an apocalyptic vision which spun the mid-70s' darkest fears into a kind of glam-rock opera. The \\"plastic soul\\" of \\"Young Americans\\" was his strange response to the sound of black America and \\"Station to Station,\\" recorded in cocaine-maddened seclusion in Los Angeles in the guise of the \\"Thin White Duke,\\" presaged his return to Europe. Remarkably, these page-turning albums emerged at the rate of around one a year. The only possible comparison in terms of creative momentum is the Beatles, and there were four of them. Beyond the records themselves, Bowie's restless eye for new stimuli, drawn from the worlds of cinema, theatre, fashion and visual art, made him pop's most imaginative stylist. London's V&A museum is mounting a major retrospective of his visual work this spring -- rare honor for a pop star. Read more: Bowie back after the bonds. As the artwork of \\"he Next Day\\" and the lyrics of comeback single \\"Where Are We Now?\\" suggest, Bowie's mystique resides most powerfully in the three albums he recorded in Berlin in the late 70s: \\"Low,\\" \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Lodger.\\" Of all his rebirths this was the most radical, influential and multi-faceted. The Berlin albums are perfectly poised between art and pop, containing both avant-garde enigmas like \\"Warszawa\\" and glorious, gripping songs like the title track of \\"Heroes,\\" which sounded not at all out of place, 35 years later, as Team GB's Olympic anthem. Brian Eno, who worked on Bowie's Berlin trilogy, once compared rock music to a blank sheet of paper that was rapidly filled in and Bowie did more than anyone in the 70s to colonize that white space. Each record was, to quote one song title, a fantastic voyage, alerting other musicians to new possibilities and charting a path for entire scenes. It's impossible to imagine the landscape of early 80s pop, for example, without Bowie's influence, and you can detect his DNA in countless artists, from Pet Shop Boys to Lady Gaga, U2 to Blur, Joy Division to Nine Inch Nails, Franz Ferdinand to LCD Soundsystem. To any musician who worries about reconciling artistic integrity with commercial success, or sonic innovation with emotional truth, Bowie's 70s work is proof that, with enough talent and judgement, you can have it all. Of course records this good cast a long shadow and, to paraphrase Barnbrook, no matter how much he tried, Bowie couldn't break free from the past. While his bad albums in subsequent decades were justly criticized, his good ones were unfairly underrated. Although he remained curious, enthusiastic and eager to take risks right up to 2003's \\"Reality,\\" he was punished for no longer reinventing the wheel with each release. As long as Bowie was still recording regularly, all but his most devoted fans took him for granted. They won't be making that mistake again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorian Lynskey.\\nHere is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"David Bowie was a very famous musician who made lots of albums over many years. He loved to try new things and change his style a lot. Sometimes, he would be a totally different character with new sounds in his music. People became very excited when he made a surprise comeback after 10 years of not making music. His albums had a big influence on other musicians and helped change the way music was made. David Bowie will always be remembered as one of the most important and creative musicians in history."},{"question":"Given the question: David was interested in climate change issues. He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which may not use average atmospheric conditions, term A or term B?  Hint: Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere.

His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith. Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates.\\n\\nNixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: \\"There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation.\\" Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor and future Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, with whom the President worked closely, bypassing Cabinet officials. With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir--border clashes between the two took place during Nixon's first year in office--Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. A breakthrough came in early 1971, when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players. Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials. On July 15, 1971, it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon (on television and radio) that the President would visit China the following February. The announcements astounded the world. The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact.  In February 1972, Nixon and his wife traveled to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40 hours in preparation. Upon touching down, the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva. Over 100 television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised.  Nixon and Kissinger met for an hour with Mao and Zhou at Mao's official private residence, where they discussed a range of issues. Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon, whom he considered forthright, unlike the leftists and the Soviets. He said he was suspicious of Kissinger, though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his \\"encounter with history\\". A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the Great Hall of the People. The following day, Nixon met with Zhou; the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China, and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification. When not in meetings, Nixon toured architectural wonders including the Forbidden City, Ming Tombs, and the Great Wall. Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life through the cameras which accompanied Pat Nixon, who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes, schools, factories, and hospitals.

He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014.\\n\\nIn 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post.  On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May.  The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%.  In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).","response":"This text is about Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a Turkish politician who is currently the President of Turkey.

Although certain behaviors and body language cues might suggest specific emotions or intentions, they cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of someone's inner thoughts or mental state.

If you decide to host a party, encourage your invited guests to show up in costume. You might select a particular theme, such as vampires or Star Wars characters, or you could simply let everyone show off their creativity in a costume of their choosing.  For larger parties, you might even hold a contest and have the other partygoers vote on their favorite costumes. Offer prizes for different categories, such as “overall best,” \\"scariest,\\" \\"funniest,\\" and “most clever idea.”  Keep in mind that not everyone likes playing dress up, and that’s okay. If you have guests who would prefer not to wear costumes, don’t try to force them to. of spooky tunes. Holiday-appropriate hits like Boris Pickett’s “Monster Mash” and “Riboflavin-Flavored, Non-Carbonated, Polyunsaturated Blood” by Don Hinson and the Rigamorticians have been giving partygoers goosebumps for decades. For a more contemporary twist, you can also queue up some pop favorites like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” The Cranberries’ “Zombie,” and “Howlin’ for You” by The Black Keys.  Other popular additions to hip Halloween playlists include “Werewolves of London” by Warren Zevon, “Psycho Killer” by Talking Heads, “Disturbia” by Rihanna, and “Sympathy for the Devil” by The Rolling Stones. Pad your playlist with the theme songs from iconic horror movie franchises like “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th.” Start with a blend of fizzy soda pop and tangy fruit juices—you’ll find lots of simple and tasty recipes online. Once you’ve got your punch tasting the way you want, add a few drops of food coloring to make it resemble blood, yucky green slime, or bubbling purple witches’ brew.  To make a simple yet satisfying Halloween punch, combine 2 litres (68  fl oz) of ginger ale with 4 cups (950 mL) of pineapple juice, 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, and a few scoops of lime sherbet. Serve your punch in a plastic cauldron on top of a block of dry ice for added \\"witchiness\\"!  For a more gruesome touch, create edible \\"eyeballs\\" by stuffing blueberries into larger lychee berries and plop them into your punch so they stare back at your guests from the surface.  If you're planning on serving alcohol at your party, consider whipping up a second bowl of punch that you can spike with your favorite liquor. Label your punches to indicate which is which, and keep your alcoholic concoctions off-limits to underage guests. Set out trays piled high with tantalizing sweets like cookies, cupcakes, and chocolates, or keep it simple with a few baskets of candy. If you have a knack for food decoration, this can be a great opportunity to conduct mad science experiments on your own Halloween-themed confections, such as candy apple skulls, vampire fang cookies, and layered candy corn parfaits.  Don’t forget to also provide a few nutritious snacks, like a veggie tray or some homemade granola bars, for your more health-conscious guests. Label the various items you put out and list their major ingredients (like the kind of nuts you used to make your brownies) in case any of your guests have food allergies or sensitivities. . Bobbing for apples is a beloved Halloween tradition, and a never-ending source of entertainment. Fill a large bucket or wash tub with water, dump in a few apples, and challenge your guests to try to pluck them out using only their mouths. Win or lose, you can bet that there will be no shortage of laughs.  If apples aren’t your thing, you can bob for other items, too, such as pears, marshmallows, or plastic-wrapped candies. Just about any small food or beverage item will work, so long as it floats and won't disintegrate in water.  Bobbing for apples is good, clean fun, making it a perfect activity for parties with kids and younger guests in attendance. Turn your home into a theater of terror with a private showing of some hair-raising fright flicks. Stick with timeless classics like Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, The Exorcist, or House on Haunted Hill, or scare the living daylights out of your guests with chilling new offerings like IT, Get Out, The Nun, or the Pet Sematary remake.  Only show movies that are appropriate for the average age of your guests. The last thing you want to do is give some poor child nightmares! If you're looking for some kid-friendly titles, try Beetlejuice, The Adams Family, Hocus Pocus, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Frankenweenie, or Hotel Transylvania. If there’s going to be alcohol at your party, start a drinking game for of-age guests who want to play along with the movies you’re watching. For instance, you might take a drink anytime someone screams or a doomed character splits off from the group.  Horror movies can make excellent background noise for a Halloween party, even if no one is watching. If you live in a residential area, chances are you’ll be visited by at least a couple waves of costumed creepers throughout the night. Keep 1 or 2 bowls of candy or other treats on hand and take turns passing out handfuls to the boys and ghouls who find their way to your door.  Try to guess what your trick-or-treaters are as you portion out their treats. If you’d rather not have to keep running back and forth to the door while you’re entertaining your guests, set out an oversized bowl of candy, along with a note instructing trick-or-treaters to take a single piece for themselves. The kids in your neighborhood will be thankful that you did!\\n\\nSummary:","response":"This article is about having a fun Halloween party.

The second statement directly implies that the woman is taking a selfie using the camera on a tripod.\\n\\nStep 4: Evaluate if one statement necessarily implies the other.\\nWhile it is possible that the woman described in the first statement is taking a selfie, as in the second statement, it is not necessarily the case. The first statement does not provide any specific information about the woman's actions.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nBased on the reasoning above, it is not possible to tell if the woman in the first statement is taking a selfie with the camera on the tripod, as described in the second statement. The first statement does not provide enough information about the woman's actions to determine whether or not she is taking a selfie."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Leatha Slauson, who cashed in more than $1,000 in donations for her child in August, has instead been ordered to spend five-years on probation in lieu of a sentence of two five-year jail terms. Slauson had faced up to 21 years in prison. District Court Judge Kathleen Kilnoski also ordered a tearful Slauson that she have no contact with her five children after she shaved her daughter Riley's head, medicated her with cannabis oil to bring on lethargy and even convinced her husband his child was dying.\\n\\nLocal authorities discovered\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- Disney World was not suffering from any terminal illness\\n- Iowa was not suffering from any terminal illness\\n- Kathleen Kilnoski was not suffering from any terminal illness\\n- Leatha Slauson was not suffering from any terminal illness\\n- Riley was not suffering from any terminal illness\\n- Slauson was not suffering from any terminal illness\\n\\n","response":"- Riley was not suffering from any terminal illness\\n\\nThe correct answer is that Riley, the 5-year-old daughter, was not suffering from any terminal illness. The passage states that Leatha Slauson tricked her community into believing her daughter had cancer and went to great lengths to maintain the deception. It is clear that the focus of the deception was on Riley's health.\\n\\nThe other options are incorrect because they refer to unrelated individuals or entities. Disney World, Iowa, Kathleen Kilnoski, and even Leatha Slauson herself are not the subjects of the deception mentioned in the passage.

The varying degrees of health insurance coverage significantly influenced their overall financial obligations for medical expenses. The fact that Lindsey had good health insurance provided her with various benefits, such as access to a broader network of healthcare providers, lower co-payments, and extensive coverage for necessary treatments or procedures. This ultimately meant that Lindsey's insurance took care of the majority of her medical bills, leaving little for her to pay out of pocket.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Amy's minimal health insurance unfortunately offered her meager assistance in covering her healthcare expenses. With limited access to healthcare providers, coupled with higher co-payments and restrictive coverage for treatments and procedures, Amy found herself facing substantial medical bills that were not covered by her insurance plan. This lack of coverage forced her to pay a significant amount of money directly from her personal finances to cater to her healthcare needs.\\n\\nSuch disparities between health insurance coverage options can greatly impact an individual's overall wellbeing and finances. Ideally, all individuals should have access to robust health insurance that protects them from bearing the brunt of unexpected medical expenses. However, the reality is that many people often settle for minimal coverage, perhaps due to affordability constraints or lack of understanding about the importance of comprehensive health insurance.\\n\\nAmy's situation serves as a reminder of the significance of making informed decisions when it comes to health insurance plans. By comparing different options and selecting a plan that provides adequate coverage, individuals can minimize their out-of-pocket expenses and enjoy peace of mind, knowing that they are protected from financial hardships caused by unforeseen medical events."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Kim Tae-Min (Hangul: 김태민; born 25 May 1982) is a South Korean footballer who plays for Police United.

Yes. 2). No.\\nAnswer:","response":"1). Yes.\\n\\nToxins can indeed decrease stamina, and since cigarette smoke contains numerous harmful toxins, it is an appropriate answer to the question. Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and tar that can enter the bloodstream and negatively affect the body's overall health and vitality, consequently decreasing stamina.\\n\\nStamina is a person's ability to sustain prolonged physical or mental activity. Various factors can influence an individual's stamina, including their overall health, fitness level, and exposure to harmful substances. When a person inhales cigarette smoke, these harmful chemicals interfere with the efficient functioning of vital organs, such as the lungs and heart, disrupt the balance of antioxidants, and cause inflammation throughout the body.\\n\\nSome of the ways in which toxins from cigarette smoke can decrease stamina include:\\n\\n1. Impeding oxygen transportation: Carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke binds to hemoglobin in the blood more effectively than oxygen, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. This can prevent muscles and organs from receiving the oxygen needed to function properly, thus decreasing stamina.\\n\\n2. Impairing lung function: Cigarette smoke damages the airways and alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs, reducing lung capacity and making it more difficult to breathe. This compromises the ability to supply oxygen to muscles during physical activity, resulting in decreased stamina.\\n\\n3. Affecting cardiovascular function: The toxins in cigarettes damage blood vessels, increase blood pressure and heart rate, and contribute to the development of arterial plaque. These effects can lead to a decrease in stamina, as the heart has to work harder to pump blood and deliver oxygen to the body's tissues.\\n\\n4. Immune system suppression: Toxins from cigarettes can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections, illness, and inflammation. A weakened immune system may contribute to decreased stamina, as the body must work harder to fight off infections and repair damaged tissues.\\n\\n5. Weight gain: Smoking can lead to weight gain, due to the addictive nature of nicotine and its effects on metabolism and appetite. Carrying extra weight can negatively impact stamina levels by putting strain on the musculoskeletal and respiratory systems.\\n\\nIt's important to note that toxins from cigarette smoke are just one example of harmful substances that can decrease stamina. Others include alcohol, drugs, environmental pollutants, and poor diet. To maintain and improve stamina, it is essential to avoid exposure to harmful substances, maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle, and engage in regular physical activity."},{"question":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In this version of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel, Jane Eyre as a young girl (Georgie Henley) is raised as a poor relation in the household of her aunt, Mrs. Reed (Tara Fitzgerald).

Nevertheless, many of his actions and perspectives have since been scrutinized due to their connection to multiple deadly sins. Let's go through some of these sins and how they might be associated with Columbus's conduct.\\n\\n1. Greed: Columbus aimed to find a westward route to Asia, but his mission extended beyond exploration. His patrons, the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella, sought to spread Christianity and gain wealth through trade. Columbus himself aimed to increase his fame and fortune. His desire for gold and other resources led to the exploitation and oppression of indigenous people in the Caribbean.\\n\\n2. Sloth: Columbus cannot necessarily be accused of sloth, as he was highly motivated and committed to sailing and discovering new lands. However, his leadership style has been criticized for negligence and cruelty, both toward the indigenous people and towards his crewmembers.\\n\\n3. Wrath/Anger: Columbus exhibited anger and violence during his voyages. He and his crew were known to treat indigenous communities poorly, punishing or torturing them for failing to meet unreasonable demands for gold, labor, or other resources.\\n\\n4. Envy: Envy in Columbus's case could come down to wanting more power and status than he possessed. In his quest for fame and fortune, he might have been envious of other explorers or political and military leaders who held considerable power.\\n\\n5. Gluttony: It's hard to link Christopher Columbus directly to gluttony, considering his life as an explorer. However, the broader goal of accumulating wealth and resources, potentially at the expense of the native peoples, could be seen as a form of gluttony in his role as a leader.\\n\\n6. Lust: There is no clear evidence that Columbus engaged in any form of lust during his voyages. However, it is important to note that the colonization and enslavement of the native peoples led to sexual exploitation of indigenous women.\\n\\n7. Pride: Columbus exhibited pride through his certainty in his navigational abilities, which led to significant miscalculations and, ultimately, the colonization of the Caribbean instead of Asia. He continued to believe that his voyages were successful, even after facing criticism and challenges during his lifetime.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it may not be entirely accurate to say Christopher Columbus condoned multiple deadly sins, it is evident that his actions during his voyages contributed to the exploitation and suffering of indigenous people. Some of these actions can undoubtedly be linked to specific deadly sins such as greed and wrath."},{"question":"Let's think step by step! One of the following sentences is nonsensical.

Context: President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.  Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

Native to Africa, Cynodon species are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They are perennial grasses, typically found in lawns, sports fields, golf courses, and pastures due to their hardy nature and ability to grow in various soil types. Cynodon dactylon is the most common species in this genus and is known for its drought tolerance, rapid growth, and ability to withstand heavy foot traffic.\\n\\nClaytonia, on the other hand, is a genus in the plant family Montiaceae, with species commonly referred to as spring beauty or miner's lettuce. Most species are native to North America, particularly in the western and north-central parts. Claytonia species are annual or perennial herbaceous plants, characterized by small, succulent leaves and showy, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or yellow. They usually grow in moist, shady environments, such as woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks.

While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy.

However, one matter remains unambiguous - the Seau family does not hold the National Football League (NFL) responsible for the unfortunate demise of their beloved family member. Despite several reports and speculations surrounding the tragic circumstances of his death in May 2012, Seau's family asserts that they do not point fingers at the NFL organization.\\n\\nA Promising Career Overshadowed by Tragedy\\n\\nBorn on January 19, 1969, Tiaina Baul Seau Jr., better known as Junior Seau, was an American professional football player with a prolific career spanning two decades. Throughout his NFL tenure, he enjoyed multiple honors and accolades that resulted from his dedication to the sport. As a linebacker, Seau was a tenacious player who put his all into every game.\\n\\nUltimately, his career was tarnished by tragedy when Seau committed suicide at the age of 43. The shockwave sent ripples throughout the media, football enthusiasts, and his family. Discussions erupted about possible links between his profession and the circumstances leading up to his death. Many have pondered whether the constant physical strain and the lingering effects of multiple injuries could have contributed to his choice to take his own life.\\n\\nThe Seau Family's Stance\\n\\nAlthough several investigations have shown that brain damage resulting from multiple concussions can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a degenerative brain disease, the Seau family chooses not to hold the NFL responsible. The family understands that football is an intense, physically demanding sport, and they acknowledge the risks associated with it. They believe that holding the NFL accountable would not bring any solace or do justice to Junior's memory.\\n\\nContrary to numerous reports suggesting that the Seau family blames the NFL for his death, they emphasize that they have no intention of dragging the league's name through the mud. They neither blame nor fault the organization, but rather wish to uphold their loved one's legacy with pride, respect, and dignity. They understand the severity and complexity of the situation and the need to focus on the essential aspects of mental health and well-being in athletes.\\n\\nPromoting Awareness and Support for Struggling Athletes\\n\\nInstead of pointing fingers at the NFL, the Seau family concentrates on raising awareness of the importance of mental health and supporting athletes who face similar struggles. They encourage the sports community to take proactive steps in ensuring players' well-being, both physically and mentally, to prevent any future tragic outcomes.\\n\\nThe family also founded the Junior Seau Foundation to honor his memory and support programs that inspire young people to embrace education and sports as a way to improve their lives and communities. This foundation works towards making a positive impact on the lives of the people it serves, ensuring that Junior's legacy of generosity and commitment to others remains intact.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe Junior Seau family maintains a firm stance in asserting that they do not blame the NFL for the death of their beloved family member. They wish to use the tragedy of his passing as a catalyst for change and to drive awareness about the importance of mental health in athletes. By focusing on the positive aspects of Junior Seau's life and channeling their energies into helping others, the Seau family honors his memory, his generosity, and his unwavering commitment to others, ensuring that his legend lives on not in blame, but in inspiration."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: In what place could you find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently?

Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

Yes\\nb). No\\nThe answer is:","response":"a). Yes\\n\\nThe correct answer is \\"sound\\" because alerting devices are designed to inform a person or grab their attention by converting electrical energy into sound. Alerting devices can include a wide range of devices such as alarms, sirens, doorbells, or smartphones (when receiving notifications). When they receive an electrical signal, these devices trigger their alerting mechanism, which transforms the electrical energy into sound waves.\\n\\nThe primary purpose of alerting devices is to communicate important information or prompt a response. Some examples of different alerting signals are:\\n\\n1. Fire alarms: When a fire alarm detects smoke or excessive heat, the sensory mechanism sends an electrical signal. The device then converts this electrical energy into sound, emitting a loud noise to alert people in the vicinity of a potential fire hazard.\\n\\n2. Doorbells: When a person presses a doorbell button, an electrical circuit is completed and sends a signal to the doorbell receiver. In response, the doorbell unit converts the electrical energy into an audible chime alerting occupants within the building.\\n\\n3. Smartphone notifications: When an individual receives a phone call, text message, or app notification, their smartphone converts electrical energy into vibrations or sound alerts.\\n\\nRegardless of the specific device being used, the critical point remains that alerting devices are designed to inform a person when an electrical signal is transformed into sound waves. This conversion allows users to perceive the alerts and respond accordingly to the situation, thus fulfilling the primary goal of these devices."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: when did mass unemployment start??

Also, the rabbits often receive better care and socialization at shelters and rescues.  By adopting from a shelter or rescue, you’ll also be providing a good home to a rabbit that needs one, rather than encouraging the breeding of additional rabbits to fill the cages at a pet store. Because the staff members at a shelter or rescue tend to be knowledgeable and eager to help, you can ask plenty of questions about the background and care needs of particular rabbits before making a decision. Rabbits at shelters or rescues might cost a little more initially, but they’re usually already de-sexed, vaccinated, de-wormed, and microchipped, which can save you money in the long run. Pet store rabbits usually come from mass-breeding operations, which tend to put profit over the health or happiness of the rabbits. Buying from pet stores only further encourages this practice.  Pet store rabbits are often more prone to digestive issues, due to being fed an inadequate diet and being exposed to excessive stress. If you do go to a pet store, ask lots of questions about where the rabbits come from and the type of care they have received. If the staff can’t or won’t provide you with satisfactory answers, go elsewhere. Not all breeders provide the same level of care or have the same degree of knowledge about the rabbits they raise. If you want to buy from a breeder, take the time to find one who is knowledgeable about rabbits and provides proper care for them.  Talk to friends with rabbits and local veterinarians to get recommendations on reputable breeders in your area. Always visit the breeding facility before buying. Look around and make sure it is clean and that the rabbits look well-fed and cared for. Ask the breeder or rescue staff lots of questions about the care they provide for their rabbits, and about the background of any particular rabbits you’re interested in. A reputable seller should always be happy to answer your questions.  For instance: “What do you feed your rabbits?”; “Do they receive regular veterinary care?”; “What can you tell me about this rabbit’s parentage?”; “Has this rabbit had any illnesses, and if so, how were they treated?” Ask for references if you want to buy from a breeder and contact some of these clients to see if they’re satisfied. A quality breeder should be willing to offer a written health guarantee, which gives you the right to return the rabbit within a certain period if a health issue arises.\\n\\nSummary:","response":"Animal shelters or rescues, unlike pet stores, usually have staff who understand how to care for rabbits better. These places also ensure rabbits get nicer care and make lots of bunny friends. When you adopt a rabbit from a shelter or rescue, you're giving a lovely home to a rabbit who really needs it, rather than encouraging more and more rabbits to be born just to stay in pet stores. The people at the shelters or rescues are really nice and can answer all of your questions about the rabbits, and even though the rabbits from there might cost a bit more at first, they often come with all their shots and medical treatments so you don't have to spend more money later. Some pet stores get their rabbits from big places that only care about money, not how happy or healthy the rabbits are. Shopping at pet stores only makes this problem worse. These store-bought rabbits might get sick more often, too. Always ask lots of questions in pet stores, and if they can't answer, find another place that can! Some rabbit breeders can be good, but you must be careful and find those who really love their rabbits and look after them well. Always check where the rabbits live and feel free to ask lots of questions. Good sellers should always be able to answer them. They should also be able to give you a written promise that you can bring the rabbit back if he gets sick soon after you take him home."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What happes to Tom and Beth? Movie plot title: Without Warning Movie plot: A father and son go hunting in the mountains. Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens. Greg plays along, telling the deranged man that an invasion force is on the way, thus distracting him enough to toss him aside, run away with Sandy and jump from a bridge.

If you have a large, heavy-bottomed, oven-proof skillet, you do not need to prepare a separate baking dish. The entire meal can be prepared in this oven-proof skillet. Add the oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high until it becomes notably smooth and glossy. This can take a minute or so. Mix the flour and salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Place the ingredients in the bag, zip closed, and shake quickly to distribute the salt evenly throughout the flour. Alternatively, you could combine the flour and salt in a wide bowl with shallow sides. Make sure that the bowl is shallow enough and wide enough for you to place a piece of steak in. Sift the ingredients together to ensure that they are well-combined. Add the steak to the flour and salt in the plastic bag and seal the bag closed. Give it a good shake so that all sides of the beef are coated in flour. If using a bowl instead of a bag, add the steak pieces to the seasoned flour in the bowl and turn them over a few times, dredging all the sides completely. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 60 minutes in your preheated oven. Slow baking in liquid is another ideal cooking method for round steaks, which tend to be fairly lean and not very tender. The slow cooking process helps the meat break down more, and the liquid prevents the beef from drying out. Uncover the dish and sprinkle the beef with the cheese. Return it to the oven and bake for another 5 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted. You could add more cheese than the recipe calls for, if desired, but adding more cheese may increase the amount of cooking time since a thicker layer will require more time to melt.

Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

For most of us, the only recycling this Christmas involved large piles of wrapping paper. But the BBC took things to a whole new level by re-using many of its biggest Christmas shows days – and in some cases, hours – after they first aired. Viewers were shocked to see shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Gruffalo’s Child, which aired on Christmas Day, reappear on BBC1 on Boxing Day. Repeat: The Gruffalo's Child, pictured, was aired on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day. The festive episode of Doctor Who was not far behind as viewers were hit with it for a second time, just two days after it premiered on December 25. The Christmas Eve episode of Winter Wipeout was on again on Boxing Day and another hotly anticipated Christmas Day show, Absolutely Fabulous, will be screened tonight. Even one of the biggest films was being given a second outing – The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe, which aired on BBC1 on Christmas Eve, is on BBC3 tomorrow night. Was this the worst Christmas ever on the BBC? ITV gave shows such as Michael Buble: Home For Christmas and The Jonathan Ross Show more than one showing, and the Christmas Day special of Downton Abbey will be screened again on New Year’s Day. But viewers singled out the BBC for recycling so much of their new output over the festive period. As well as its big  Christmas Day shows, the corporation also aired cookery shows The Hairy Bikers’ Christmas Party, Rick Stein’s Spanish Christmas and Lorraine’s Last Minute Christmas only 15 hours after their first slot. Viewers have also complained that this year’s festive line-up was one of the worst in recent memory. Shows such as the return of Absolutely Fabulous  did not live up to many people’s expectations and the new Sir David Jason comedy was another disappointment. As well, the Downton Abbey special on Christmas Day did not get the huge ratings many were expecting. One viewer wrote on the BBC’s message board: ‘What’s with all the repeats? On Boxing Day you repeated Strictly from Christmas Day, Winter Wipeout from Christmas Eve, not to  mention the numerous repeats of the Morecambe and Wise Specials. ‘There is no need to repeat programmes now as  most people have access to a digital recorder… can’t you spend the licence fee on some new programmes instead.’ A BBC spokesman  said: ‘We never repeat prime-time shows in the same slot. ‘This Christmas has seen brand new shows in  drama, factual, entertainment and religion. ‘Over 91 per cent of programming on peak-time on BBC1 is brand new and has never been shown before.’\\nWhat are the important parts of this article?","response":"1.

In the first quarter, Buffalo drew first blood with rookie QB Trent Edwards completing a 13-yard TD pass and a 28-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal.  Afterwards, the Bills continued their early pounding as Safety George Wilson returned a fumble 20 yards for a touchdown.  The Dolphins would get on the board with RB Samkon Gado getting a 12-yard TD run, yet Buffalo would answer right back with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 51-yard field goal, setting a new Buffalo Bills record for 18 consecutive field goals (beating Steve Christie's old record of 17; Lindell would later miss wide left from 46).  In the second quarter, the Bills continued their domination with Edwards completing a 9-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, Miami tried to rally as Gado got a 20-yard TD run, while kicker Jay Feely nailed a 41-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo would put the game away as Edwards hooked up with Evans again on a 70-yard TD pass to secure a season-sweep.\\nAnswer this question: How many total TD pass yards did Trent Edwards have?","response":"Trent Edwards, who is the rookie quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, threw a few touchdown passes when they played against the Miami Dolphins.

Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.

He was a direct descendant of Jesse de Forest, the leader of a group of Walloon Huguenots who fled Europe in the 17th Century due to religious persecution. De Forest's father was a Congregational Church minister who hoped his son would also become a pastor. In 1879 the elder de Forest became president of the American Missionary Association's Talladega College in Talladega, Alabama, a school \\"open to all of either sex, without regard to sect, race, or color\\", and which educated primarily African-Americans.\\n\\nOne of de Forest's areas of research at Federal Telegraph was improving the reception of signals, and he came up with the idea of strengthening the audio frequency output from a grid Audion by feeding it into a second tube for additional amplification. He called this a \\"cascade amplifier\\", which eventually consisted of chaining together up to three Audions.  At this time the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was researching ways to amplify telephone signals to provide better long-distance service, and it was recognized that de Forest's device had potential as a telephone line repeater. In mid-1912 an associate, John Stone Stone, contacted AT&T to arrange for de Forest to demonstrate his invention. It was found that de Forest's \\"gassy\\" version of the Audion could not handle even the relatively low voltages used by telephone lines. (Due to the way he constructed the tubes, de Forest's Audions would cease to operate with too high a vacuum.) However, careful research by Dr. Harold D. Arnold and his team at AT&T's Western Electric subsidiary determined that by improving the tube's design, it could be more fully evacuated, and the high vacuum allowed it to successfully operate at telephone line voltages. With these changes the Audion evolved into a modern electron-discharge vacuum tube, using electron flows rather than ions. (Dr. Irving Langmuir at the General Electric Corporation made similar findings, and both he and Arnold attempted to patent the \\"high vacuum\\" construction, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1931 that this modification could not be patented).  After a delay of ten months, in July 1913 AT&T, through a third party who disguised his link to the telephone company, purchased the wire rights to seven Audion patents for $50,000. De Forest had hoped for a higher payment, but was again in bad financial shape and was unable to bargain for more. In 1915, AT&T used the innovation to conduct the first transcontinental telephone calls, in conjunction with the Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San Francisco.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was his next attempt","response":"Lee de Forest's next attempt was to improve the reception of signals.

SauniÃ¨re gives him a false lead and is murdered, the police finding his body posed like the Vitruvian Man. Police captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) summons American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) to examine SauniÃ¨reâs body. Langdon discovers a message hidden by blacklight which contains an out of order Fibonacci number sequence. A police cryptographer and SauniÃ¨reâs granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), reveals to Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him, believing he murdered SauniÃ¨re due to a message to find him, erased by Fache. The two get rid of the tracker and sneak around the Louvre, finding more clues in Leonardo da Vinciâs works, Langdon deducing that SauniÃ¨re was grand master of the Priory of Sion. Silas is revealed to be working for an anonymous person named the Teacher, alongside members of Opus Dei led by Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina).

Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws.

In 1960, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend the ceremony. The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent.

Answer by more, less or no effect\\nA:","response":"Let's break down the two scenarios mentioned and analyze how they might interact.\\n\\nScenario 1: More butterflies mate with each other\\nThis scenario involves an increase in the reproductive activity of butterflies, which may lead to a larger butterfly population. The mating behavior of butterflies has no direct connection to human physiological processes, such as eating food or managing blood sugar levels. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an increase in butterfly mating would have a direct effect on a person's dietary habits or blood sugar levels.\\n\\nScenario 2: A person eats more high sugar food\\nThis scenario involves an individual consuming a diet that is higher in sugar. Consuming high sugar food can impact a person's blood sugar levels, insulin production, and overall cellular function. As mentioned in the original process description, a person's blood sugar level rises when they consume food, and the pancreas releases insulin to help regulate this increase.\\n\\nNow, let's consider how the supposed perturbation (more butterfly mating) may influence the second effect mentioned (a person eating more high sugar food). Since the two scenarios are unrelated – one involves butterfly reproduction while the other involves human dietary habits – the first scenario should have no direct effect on the second.\\n\\nThus, we can conclude that the supposed perturbation (more butterfly mating) will have no effect on the second effect mentioned (a person eating more high sugar food).

Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it.

Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately $2 (US$4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album.

Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees.

Options: - gifting - buying - money - literacy - knowing how to read  Explain why a human would choose \\"buying\\" to answer the question above:\\nThe answer to this question is:","response":"\\"buying\\"\\n\\nIn order to understand why a human would choose the option \\"buying\\" as the answer to the question above, let's analyze each of the given options in relation to the context provided.\\n\\nThe context is about a person who enjoys reading newspapers and is considering getting a subscription. A newspaper subscription typically involves regularly receiving issues of a publication, usually on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. This is a paid service that grants the subscriber access to valuable content and keeps them informed or entertained.\\n\\nNow let's break down and analyze each of the given options:\\n\\n1. Gifting: This option refers to the act of giving something voluntarily, as a favor or as a present, without expecting anything in return. Although it's true that someone might gift a newspaper subscription to a person who enjoys reading newspapers, it's not directly related to the person considering a subscription for themselves.\\n\\n2. Buying: This option implies the act of obtaining something in exchange for money, which is often the case with a newspaper subscription. By choosing this option, a person would show their willingness to invest money in order to gain access to regular issues of a publication they enjoy reading.\\n\\n3. Money: While money is involved in getting a subscription, as you usually have to pay for the service, it doesn't directly convey the action of a person considering a subscription. It merely represents the medium used for exchange.\\n\\n4. Literacy: Knowing how to read is a prerequisite to appreciating newspapers, but it doesn't directly relate to the act of a person considering a subscription. Literacy is simply the ability to read and write, not necessarily the willingness to subscribe to a publication.\\n\\n5. Knowing how to read: Similar to literacy, knowing how to read is a necessary skill to enjoy reading newspapers. However, it does not directly express someone's intent to subscribe to the publication.\\n\\nIn conclusion, among all the provided options, \\"buying\\" is the most appropriate and fitting answer to the question above. It captures the essence of the context by indicating the person's intention to invest money in obtaining regular access to their favorite newspaper through a subscription. The other options, while somewhat related, don't directly align with the core idea of the question. By choosing \\"buying,\\" a human correctly identifies the action most likely taken by someone who enjoys reading newspapers and is considering the idea of subscribing."},{"question":"\\"Which pop song includes the lyrics \\"\\"and through it all she offers me protection, a lot of love and affection\\"\\"?\\"\\nWhat is the answer?","response":"The answer is the song \\"Angels\\" by Robbie Williams.

More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.\\"  Answer:\\nThe answer to this question is:","response":"The CF (Canadian Armed Forces) was recruiting strongly due to several factors, including the need to modernize their forces, address dwindling recruitment in previous decades, and counterbalance the increased loss of existing members.

Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus., can you guess it ?\\nA:","response":"The lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days were held in the Colosseum to celebrate its completion in AD 80."},{"question":"Premise: \\"In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips, with the brief command \\"Drink.\\" Tommy obeyed.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He refused their offer of a drink, despite his thirst.\\"?","response":"If we consider the given premise to be true, we can analyze both the premise and the hypothesis to determine whether they can coexist or if the hypothesis contradicts the premise.\\n\\nPremise: \\"In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips, with the brief command \\"Drink.\\" Tommy obeyed.\\"\\n\\nThis premise provides us with several key pieces of information. Firstly, we learn that there is a German character who stepped forward and offered a glass to someone named Tommy. Secondly, the German briefly commands Tommy to drink, thus implying that the German has authority in the situation or is assertive in prompting Tommy to consume the beverage. Lastly, the most crucial point in the premise is that Tommy obeys the German's command and drinks from the glass.\\n\\nHypothesis: \\"He refused their offer of a drink, despite his thirst.\\"\\n\\nThis hypothesis presents a scenario where someone, presumably Tommy from the premise, is refusing an offer to drink even though he is thirsty. As we can see, the statement creates direct opposition to the events described in the premise.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the consistency between the premise and the hypothesis. In the premise, Tommy obeys the German's command and drinks from the glass. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which suggests that someone (most likely Tommy) refused an offer of a drink.\\n\\nIf we assume that the premise is entirely accurate, we must conclude that the hypothesis does not hold true. The premise establishes that Tommy drinks from the glass, while the hypothesis implies that he refuses the offer of a drink. Given the information, the two scenarios cannot coexist, which means the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and instead contradicts it.\\n\\nHowever, it is essential to note that assumptions and interpretations play a significant role in understanding situations, and if additional context or information were available, it could potentially alter our analysis of the premise and hypothesis. But, based on the given information, the premise and hypothesis contradict one another."},{"question":"Sentence: name = Clowns, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, customer rating = average, area = riverside, near = Clare Hall\\n\\nCan you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","response":"To represent the content of the sentence in data form, I will create a dictionary with keys and values based on the given information.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the keys (attributes) and values (information) present in the sentence.\\n- name = Clowns\\n- eatType = coffee shop\\n- food = Fast food\\n- customer rating = average\\n- area = riverside\\n- near = Clare Hall\\n\\nStep 2: Create a dictionary with the identified keys and values.\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"Clowns\\",\\n  \\"eatType\\": \\"coffee shop\\",\\n  \\"food\\": \\"Fast food\\",\\n  \\"customer_rating\\": \\"average\\",\\n  \\"area\\": \\"riverside\\",\\n  \\"near\\": \\"Clare Hall\\"\\n}\\n\\nBy following these steps, I have represented the content of the sentence in data form using a dictionary."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.  - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island.

The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - Poaceae or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses. Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns (turf) and pasture. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath.

The population was 72,301 at the 2014 census.  - Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae), however sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface.  - An ecoregion (ecological region) is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than a bioregion, which in turn is smaller than an ecozone. All three of these are either less or greater than an ecosystem. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).  - Martinique is an insular region of France located in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, with a land area of and a population of 385,551 inhabitants as of January 2013.

Bordering the Caribbean to the north, it shares maritime boundaries with other nations including Barbados to the northeast, Grenada to the northwest, Guyana to the southeast, and Venezuela to the south and west.  - The number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray.  - Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \\"shrubland\\" was first coined in 1903.  - Saint Lucia is a sovereign island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean. Part of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique.

International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae, characterized by long wings, short legs and very short bills. They are sometimes called goatsuckers, due to the ancient folk tale that they sucked the milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is \\"Caprimulgus\\"). Some New World species are called nighthawks. Nightjars usually nest on the ground.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Bridgetown (UN/LOCODE: BB BGI) is the capital and largest city of Barbados. Formerly The Town of Saint Michael, the Greater Bridgetown area is located within the parish of Saint Michael.

It is, however, included in the Caribbean Region due to its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Brazil to the south and southwest, Suriname to the east and Venezuela to the west. With , Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after Uruguay, Suriname and French Guiana.  - The white - tailed nightjar ( Hydropsalis cayennensis ) is a species of nightjar in the Caprimulgidae family . It is found in Aruba , Barbados , Brazil , Colombia , Costa Rica , Ecuador , French Guiana , Guyana , Martinique , Netherlands Antilles , Panama , Suriname , Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela .

Barbados is outside of the principal Atlantic hurricane belt. Its capital is Bridgetown. Barbados is Southeast of Miami.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.

The report, posted on the Internet, did not explain how exactly the traders acquired the rats and other creatures. \\n  \\n “How many rats does it take to put together a sheep?” said one typically baffled and angry user of Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like microblog service that often acts as a forum for public venting. “Is it cheaper to raise rats than sheep?” \\n  \\n Residents of Shanghai recently endured the sight of thousands of dead hogs floating down a nearby river, apparently the dumped victims of disease in piggeries upstream. \\n  \\n The arrests were part of a nationwide operation since late January to “attack food safety crimes and defend the safety of the dining table,” the ministry said. The police arrested 904 people suspected of selling fake, diseased, toxic or adulterated meat, and broke up 1,721 illicit factories, workshops and shops. Yet the ministry acknowledged that diners still had reason to worry. \\n  \\n In food safety campaigns in past years, “some serious problems have been dealt with swiftly and vigorously, but for a variety of reasons, food safety crimes remain serious, and are displaying new circumstances and features,” an unnamed senior official said in the statement. \\n  \\n “For example, there is selling of meat injected with water and meat from animals dead from disease, as well as passing off relatively cheap types of meat as relatively expensive beef and mutton.” \\n  \\n China’s prime minister since March, Li Keqiang, has said that improving food safety is a priority — one of the main grievances of citizens that he has said his government will tackle. \\n  \\n But similar vows by his predecessor, Wen Jiabao, ran up against inadequate resources, buck-passing and muddle among rival agencies, and protectionism by local officials, Mao Shoulong, a professor of public policy at Renmin University in Beijing, said in an interview. \\n  \\n “The United States and Europe can’t eradicate these problems, either, but they are even more complicated in China,” said Professor Mao, who has studied food and pharmaceutical safety regulation. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n “Chinese food production has become larger scale and more technological, but the problems emerging also involve using more sophisticated technology to beat regulators and cheat consumers,” he said. “The government’s efforts need to catch up with the scale and complexity of the problems.” \\n  \\n This time, at least, the government gave consumers a stomach-churning glimpse into problems in the meat industry. \\n  \\n The cases described included a company in Inner Mongolia, a northeast region of China, caught with 23 tons of fake beef jerky and unprocessed frozen meat adulterated with flavoring chemicals and swarming with bacteria. Six suspects in Guizhou Province, in southwest China, were caught with 8.8 tons of “toxic chicken feet” marinated in a hydrogen peroxide solution and adulterated with illegal additives. Chicken feet, steamed or boiled with spices, are a popular dish in parts of China. \\n  \\n The fraud sometimes had deadly results. In February, the police in Shaanxi Province in northwest China arrested a suspect accused of selling a lamb carcass so heavily laced with pesticide that one person died after eating the barbecued meat. \\n  \\n In another show of official efforts to stem public ire over menaces to food safety, China’s Supreme People’s Court, the country’s highest court, on Friday issued guidelines for sternly punishing related offenses, like taking “ditch” cooking oil that has been used and dumped in drains and processing it to be resold for cooking. Such problems “seriously affect social harmony and stability, and seriously harm the image of the party and government,” the court said in a statement issued by state-run media. \\n  \\n Public discontent about food safety has brought growing pressure on the Chinese Communist Party leadership, especially since 2008, when officials acknowledged that tens of thousands of children were at risk from kidney stones and other organ damage caused by milk powder adulterated with melamine, a chemical used to bamboozle protein tests. At least six infants died from illnesses attributed to the toxin, which sickened more than 300,000 children. \\n  \\n Many consumers have recently stopped buying chicken and duck out of worries about avian flu. Parents in many Chinese cities, including Beijing, have become increasingly alarmed by acrid pollution that doctors blame for increased respiratory illnesses. \\n  \\n “Food safety and environmental protection face the same problem that although regulatory capacity has expanded, there’s been no fundamental change for the better,” Professor Mao said. “The fact that the police have become involved shows how serious the problems still are.” ||||| BEIJING | \\n  \\n BEIJING May 3 (Reuters) - Chinese police have broken a crime ring that passed off more than $1 million in rat and small mammal meat as mutton, authorities said, in a food safety crackdown that coincides with a bird flu outbreak and other environmental pressures. \\n  \\n Authorities have arrested 904 suspects since the end of January for selling and producing fake or tainted meat products, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday. \\n  \\n During the crackdown, police discovered one suspect surnamed Wei who had used additives to spice up and sell rat, fox and mink meat at markets in Shanghai and Jiangsu province. \\n  \\n Police arrested 63 suspects connected to the crime ring in a case valued at more than 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) in sales since 2009. \\n  \\n Despite persistent efforts by police, \\"food safety crimes are still prominent, and new situations are emerging with new characteristics\\", the ministry's statement said, citing \\"responsible officials\\". \\n  \\n Police confiscated more than 20,000 tonnes of fake or inferior meat products after breaking up illegal food plants during the nationwide operation, the ministry said. \\n  \\n Food safety and environmental pollution are chronic problems in China and public anxiety over cases of fake or toxic food often spreads quickly. \\n  \\n In April, many consumers lost their appetite for poultry as an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu virus spread in China. Sales dropped by 80 percent in eastern China, where the bird flu has been most prevalent, although experts stress that cooked chicken is perfectly safe. \\n  \\n In March, more than 16,000 rotting pigs were found floating in one of Shanghai's main water sources, triggering a public outcry. Over-crowding at pig farms was likely behind the die-off and their disposal in the Huangpu river. \\n  \\n The public security ministry said police had confiscated more than 15 tonnes of tainted pork in Anhui province, although as much as 60 tonnes had been sold in Anhui and Fujian provinces since mid-2012. \\n  \\n But it was the rodent meat in particular that people couldn't stomach, with Internet users turning to the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo to vent their outrage. \\n  \\n \\"Rats?

Strain the juice to remove any pieces of shell. Add enough water to the juice to make 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid.  Rough-chop the clams into small pieces and set aside. Canned clams can be used instead of fresh clams. You should still drain the liquid from these clams and reserve it for use in the chowder. Add enough water to the liquid to make 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid. Alternatively, add bottled clam juice to the reserved clam juice instead of water. Doing so will create a stronger clam flavor. Cook the bacon over medium heat for several minutes until it turns crisp and brown on both sides.  If the saucepan is too small to place full strips of bacon in, cut the slices in halves or thirds before placing them in the pan. Note that bacon has enough fat in it to cook without the addition of extra oil. When the bacon has finished cooking, drain it on paper towels and crumble it into small pieces. Set aside until the end. Alternatively, you could use pre-cooked bacon or bacon bits instead of cooking your own bacon. Pour most of the bacon grease out of the saucepan, saving only 1 Tbsp (15 ml).  If, for whatever reason, you do not have enough grease to leave 1 Tbsp (15 ml) in the pan, add enough olive oil or cooking oil to make up the difference. If using pre-cooked bacon or bacon bits, heat 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil or cooking oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour the reserved, diluted clam juice into the saucepan. Add the potatoes, onion, instant bouillon granules, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and dried thyme immediately afterward.  You will need 3 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped into small, bite-size pieces. This should make about 2 1/2 cups (625 ml) of potatoes. Chop 1 large onion, creating roughly 1 cup (250 ml) of chopped onion. Use chicken or vegetable bouillon granules. Do not use beef-flavored granules. Crush the thyme with your fingers before adding it. If using fresh thyme instead of dried, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) and chop the thyme well before adding it. Heat the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 15 minutes.  Cover the pan as the chowder base simmers. The potatoes should be tender once finished. Press each potato against the side of the pan using the back of a fork.  The potatoes should not be completely mashed, but they should be crushed or crumbled once finished. Note that this step can be skipped if you diced the potatoes into small enough chunks. In a separate dish, combine the milk, half-and-half, and flour until smooth. Stir this mixture into the saucepan until evenly blended.  Once the flour mixture has been added to the chowder base, the contents of the saucepan should bubble and thicken. You can use whole milk or 2-percent milk. Similarly, you could use half-and-half or light cream. Stir the chopped or minced clams into the chowder. Let boil, then reduce the heat and cook for 2 additional minutes. Boiling and simmering the chowder after you add the clams will ensure that the clams are cooked without being overcooked. It also ensures that the entire dish will be heated through. Pour the clam chowder into individual serving bowls and sprinkle with some of the bacon that you set aside earlier.\\n\\nWhat is a summary?","response":"A summary would be a short and simple version of all the instructions provided to make clam chowder.\\n\\nHere's a summary for you: First, collect the clam juice and mix it with water or bottled clam juice.

To elaborate:\\n\\n1. Safety First: Upon completion of the baking time, put on oven mitts or use a thick towel to protect your hands from the heat. Open the oven and, using both hands, gently remove the cake pan from the oven.\\n\\n2. Testing Cake Doneness: Before entirely removing the cake from the oven, you can perform a quick test to ensure that it's fully baked. Take a toothpick or a small skewer and insert it into the center or thickest part of the cake. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs attached, the cake is done. If the toothpick comes out with wet batter, then bake the cake for a few minutes longer and test again until it's fully baked.\\n\\n3. Cooling the Cake: Place the cake pan on a wire rack or any heat-resistant and well-ventilated surface to cool. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes. Cooling the cake before removing it from the pan is essential, as it will help the cake set and reduce the chances of it breaking or sticking to the pan.\\n\\n4. Removing the Cake from the Pan: After allowing the cake to cool for the recommended time, gently run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen any areas that may be sticking to the pan. If you're using a springform pan, release the sides of the pan. Carefully flip the cake pan upside down over a wire rack or flat plate, and tap it gently to help release the cake. If the cake doesn't release immediately, give it a few more minutes to cool before attempting again.\\n\\n5. Final Cooling: Once the cake is out of the pan, let it cool on the wire rack or plate for another 1-2 hours until it reaches room temperature. Cooling the cake entirely is crucial, especially if you plan on frosting or decorating the cake, as warm cake will cause the frosting to melt or decorations to slide off.\\n\\n6. Frosting and Decorating: Now that your cake is completely cooled, you can proceed with frosting and decorating as desired. Apply a layer of frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake using a spatula or a frosting knife. You can also use a piping bag and various piping tips to create intricate patterns and designs.\\n\\n7. Serving and Storing: Once the cake is frosted and decorated, you can either serve it immediately or store it properly, depending on when you plan to serve it. For storing, cover the cake with a cake dome or a large container to protect it from air and dust. Depending on the type of cake and frosting, you may need to refrigerate the cake or store it at room temperature.\\n\\nRemember to enjoy your freshly baked and beautifully decorated cake with your loved ones!"},{"question":"Translate to Russian:\\n\\nThe Obama campaign’s use of the database with such efficiency and at such a huge scale during the fast-moving presidential primary process had helped him to win the Democratic Party nomination.\\n\\nRussian:","response":"Применение базы данных кампанией Обамы с такой эффективностью и в таком масштабе во время быстрого процесса президентских первичных выборов помогло ему выиграть номинацию от Демократической партии.\\n\\nStep-by-step translation justification:\\n1. \\"The Obama campaign's use of the database\\" - \\"Применение базы данных кампанией Обамы\\" - placing the subject (Obama campaign) first, followed by the verb (use) and the object (database).\\n2. \\"with such efficiency\\" - \\"с такой эффективностью\\" - translated as an adverbial modifier indicating the manner of use.\\n3. \\"and at such a huge scale\\" - \\"и в таком масштабе\\" - another adverbial modifier, maintaining parallel structure with \\"с такой эффективностью.\\"\\n4. \\"during the fast-moving presidential primary process\\" - \\"во время быстрого процесса президентских первичных выборов\\" - a prepositional phrase, translated using \\"во время\\" to indicate \\"during\\" and maintaining adjective-noun order (fast-moving - быстрого, presidential primary process - процесса президентских первичных выборов).\\n5. \\"had helped him\\" - \\"помогло ему\\" - using the past tense auxiliary verb \\"помогло\\" (had helped) with the pronoun \\"ему\\" (him) to indicate Obama as the recipient of the action.\\n6. \\"to win the Democratic Party nomination\\" - \\"выиграть номинацию от Демократической партии\\" - using the infinitive \\"выиграть\\" (to win) followed by the direct object in the genitive case \\"номинацию от Демократической партии\\" (the Democratic Party nomination)."},{"question":"Summarize this article:\\n\\nMaybe he wants to help “restore sanity.” \\n  \\n President Obama will make his first appearance as president on the comedy program “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” next week, days ahead of the midterm election, a White House spokesman said. \\n  \\n The interview’s timing is also notable because it comes just before Mr. Stewart’s “Rally to Restore Sanity” in Washington, D.C. \\n  \\n (Actually, the rally was renamed the “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear” last week because Mr. Stewart’s satiric colleague Stephen Colbert will also be there.) \\n  \\n Mr. Stewart is bringing “The Daily Show” to D.C. next week, culminating in the rally on Oct. 30.

It is typically made from flour, water, yeast, and salt. The flour provides structure through gluten formation, the yeast allows the dough to rise which lightens its texture, the salt adds flavor and controls yeast activity, and the water hydrates the flour and dissolves the other ingredients to form the dough. Dough can vary greatly in its consistency and flavor, depending on factors like the type of flour used, the amount of hydration, the fermentation time, and the method of kneading.\\n\\nOnce the dough has been prepared and properly risen - a process that could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days - it is then stretched to create the pizza's crust. Stretching the dough is a critical step as it not only determines the size of the pizza, but also the thickness of the crust, which can greatly affect the pizza's overall texture and mouthfeel. Over-stretching can tear the dough and create thin spots, while under-stretching may result in a doughy, under-cooked center.\\n\\nThe stretched home-made or store-bought pizza dough is then prepared for saucing. Sauce is an integral component of a pizza, contributing significantly to its overall taste. The most common type is tomato sauce, made by simmering tomatoes with garlic, onions, and various herbs until it thickens into a flavorful concentrate. The sauce can be chunky or smooth based on personal preference. However, not all pizzas use tomato sauce; some types like white pizza use a creamy garlic sauce and others yet, like BBQ chicken pizza, utilize barbecue sauce.\\n\\nAfter dough stretching, it is now time to spread the sauce. Spreading it evenly over the dough ensures that every bite of pizza has a balanced flavor. The quantity of the sauce may vary depending on personal tastes; however, adding too much can make the pizza soggy. The sauce is typically spread with a ladle or spoon, leaving a small border around the edge for the crust. This process can be a tricky balance of ensuring enough coverage without over saturating or weighing down the dough.\\n\\nThese fundamental concepts - preparing and stretching dough, making and spreading sauce - are crucial to creating the perfect pizza, marrying different textures and flavors to achieve a harmonious and delicious result. In conclusion, pizza making is an art wherein attention to the dough, sauce, and the techniques of stretching and spreading are of utmost importance."},{"question":"Question: When was St. Francis Xavier born?\\n\\nIs \\"Historian H.

Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters. He served as a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor at Johns Hopkins University. Brzezinski went on to ruffle the feathers of Washington's power elite with his 1983 book, \\"Power and... When did Brzezinski help President carter? - before working with Kennedy - during the cold war - After working for Johnson - not enough information\\nThe answer to this question is:","response":"Brzezinski helped President Carter during his presidency, which was after working for Johnson and before the Cold War ended. Carter served as the President of the United States from January 20, 1977, to January 20, 1981, while Brzezinski served as his National Security Adviser during the same period."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces  ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\".

A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. After signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single \\"Creep\\" in 1992.\\n\\nRadiohead recorded their debut release, the Drill EP, with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with US indie bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992. With the release of the \\"Creep\\" single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; NME described them as \\"a lily-livered excuse for a rock band\\", and \\"Creep\\" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 because it was deemed \\"too depressing\\".  Radiohead released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in February 1993. It stalled at number 22 in the UK charts, as \\"Creep\\" and its follow-up singles \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" and \\"Stop Whispering\\" failed to become hits. \\"Pop Is Dead\\", a non-album single, also sold poorly. Some critics compared the band's early style to the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them \\"Nirvana-lite\\", and Pablo Honey failed to make a critical or a commercial impact upon its initial release. Despite shared influences with popular guitar acts, and some notice for Yorke's falsetto, Radiohead toured only British universities and clubs.  In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. \\"Creep\\" had been played frequently on Israeli radio by influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and in March, after the song became a hit in that country, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first live gig overseas. Around the same time, the San Francisco alternative radio station KITS added \\"Creep\\" to its playlist. Soon other radio stations along the west coast of the United States followed suit. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for \\"Creep\\" was in heavy rotation on MTV. The song rose to number two on the US modern rock chart, entered the lower reaches of the top 40 pop chart, and hit number seven in the UK Singles Chart when EMI rereleased it in the UK in September.  Unexpected attention for the single in the US prompted EMI to improvise new promotional plans, and the band shuttled back and forth between continents, playing more than 150 concerts in 1993. Radiohead nearly broke up due to the pressure of sudden success as the Pablo Honey supporting tour extended into its second year. The band members described the tour as difficult to adjust to, saying that towards its end they were \\"still playing the same songs that [they had] recorded two years previously ... like being held in a time warp\\", when they were eager to work on new songs.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","response":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects about this article. One such aspect is the initial reception and rise in popularity of Radiohead's single \\"Creep.\\" The quote, \\"In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What nightmare does Block have ? Movie title: Tightrope Movie plot: The film opens with a young woman, Melanie Silber (Jamie Rose), walking home late one night in New Orleans down a deserted street. A sound startles her and she drops her packages. A man approaches her. She relaxes when she sees he is wearing a police uniform. He watches her enter her house, then the camera pans down and we see the man isn't wearing regulation police boots, but sneakers.The next day Silber's body is found naked across her bed. She has been raped and strangled. It looks like one in a series of murders so it is passed to a task force headed by Detective Wes Block (Clint Eastwood). Block is recovering from a recent divorce and is trying to put his life back together while caring for his two daughters: 11 year-old Amanda (Alison Eastwood) and 9 year-old Penny (Jenny Beck).Block's partner, Det. Molinari (Dan Hedaya) notes that while the girl was apparently attacked at about 9:15PM, she wasnt killed until after mid-night and wonders about the delay. Block notes that the killer left a half-eaten brownie and an empty coffee cup and comments that the killer was taking his time because he was enjoying what he was doing to the victim.The lab reports that the killer wore sneakers and left traces of barley and tiny glass fragments behind. His blood type is \\"O.\\" Marks on her wrists suggest that the Silber was handcuffed.Back at the office Block's boss, (Bill Holliday) is annoyed at him for the lack of progress on these cases. Block is also being pursued by rape prevention worker Beryl Thibodeaux (Geneviève Bujold) who wants to talk to him about the case. She finally catches up with him, but he doesn't want to divulge any information to her that might compromise the investigation. She tells him they should put up posters warning women of the danger, but Block states that would only terrify the city's female population. Thibodeaux replies that given the circumstances, maybe they should be terrified.The victim was prostitute and Block goes to interview a Sarita (Regina Richardson) a woman Silber sometimes...\\nAnswer:","response":"In the movie Tightrope, Detective Wes Block's nightmare is his inner struggle with his dark desires and personal demons, which parallel the killer he is hunting. As he investigates the string of serial murders involving women in New Orleans, he starts to see similarities between the killer's behavior and his own disturbing fantasies. This realization troubles Block, making him question his morality and self-control.\\n\\nThroughout the film, Block is seen engaging in encounters with women that involve elements of domination and submission, reflecting his suppressed desires. This internal conflict becomes a central theme in the movie, creating a great deal of psychological and emotional turmoil for Block. As he continues pursuing the killer, he is not only attempting to solve the case, but also to confront and understand these darker aspects of his own personality.\\n\\nIn summary, the nightmare that Detective Wes Block faces in Tightrope is his confrontation with his own dark desires and personal demons that he must confront and deal with in order to maintain control and successfully carry out his job of hunting down the serial killer."},{"question":"Cattle Decapitation is an American extreme metal band from San Diego, California, formed in 1996.

Her plan was carefully crafted to align with the company's long-term goals while addressing the immediate challenges at hand. The GM, who valued efficiency and consistency, recognized that Patricia's plan incorporated a well-defined approach to achieving success without drastically diverting from the current growth path.\\n\\nCarrie, on the other hand, had presented a risky and offbeat proposal, which could have potentially resulted in a high return on investment. However, the GM was not comfortable with deviating so far from the company's established practices and foundation.\\n\\nAnother factor that played a role in the GM's decision was the distribution of resources involved in both plans. Patricia's plan made optimal use of the company's current staff and budget, requiring minimal additional expenditure. It focused on maximizing efficiency and streamlining operations, thereby cutting costs and ensuring the sustainable growth of the business. In contrast, Carrie's plan involved substantially increasing the budget to fund her ambitious ideas, which the GM deemed as an unnecessary risk given the company's current financial standing.\\n\\nMoreover, Patricia's plan demonstrated a keen understanding of the market dynamics and specifically catered to the company's target audience. It placed a strong emphasis on innovation and utilizing technology to create unique, user-friendly solutions that would resonate with the customers. This focus on innovation tied in perfectly with the company's mission to be at the forefront of industry advancements. Carrie's plan was more focused on aggressive marketing and expansion tactics, which, although potentially profitable, lacked the foresight to account for the rapidly evolving industry landscape and the company's core values.\\n\\nFurthermore, Patricia's plan prioritized nurturing existing client relationships and improving customer service, which was a key factor in retaining the company's current market share. During turbulent economic times, customer loyalty was an invaluable asset. In contrast, Carrie's plan relied heavily on attracting new clients and expanding into uncharted territories, leaving an element of uncertainty in terms of revenue and customer retention.\\n\\nThe GM also took into consideration that Patricia's plan included appropriate risk management strategies and contingencies. This demonstrated her foresight in identifying potential challenges ahead and addressing them proactively, which further bolstered the GM's confidence in her proposal.\\n\\nIn the end, the GM chose Patricia's plan because it better adhered to the company's strategic vision, effectively managed existing resources, and pushed for innovation while maintaining a focus on customer relationships. Although Carrie's plan showed promise, the risks and significant budgetary changes outweighed the potential advantages. With the GM's support, Patricia was able to carry out her plan and contribute to the company's ongoing success in their competitive industry."},{"question":"Title: hdtvisgreat Review: The tuner card from ati is great, but it is worthless with the software they package with it.

Yes, it follows that \\"Within three hours the horse had ceased to be living.\\"\\n\\nThe statement \\"The horse died within hours\\" suggests that the horse's death occurred within a short span of time. The phrase \\"within hours\\" is an indication of a relatively quick occurrence, implying that the event in question (in this case, the horse's death) happened in a matter of hours or less.\\n\\nThe statement \\"Within three hours the horse had ceased to be living\\" is compatible with the original statement.

The reviewer has expressed their dissatisfaction with the product in multiple ways, which demonstrates their unfavorable experience and opinion.\\n\\nFirstly, the title itself, \\"This product sucks.

The use of the term \\"sucks\\" immediately indicates that the reviewer did not enjoy using the product, setting the stage for the rest of the commentary to follow in a similar vein.\\n\\nMoreover, the review itself reiterates the product's poor performance with the statement, \\"It broke after a few weeks.\\" This highlights the product's lack of durability, implying that it was unable to withstand the test of time, even if just for a short period. The reviewer then goes on to mention specific issues with the product's design, stating that \\"it has plastic pieces that turn the grinder,\\" which \\"disengaged from the gear when it turns the grinder.\\" This aspect of the review showcases further dissatisfaction with the product and its components, as the writing details the malfunction of the product, possibly due to a design flaw or shoddy construction.\\n\\nLastly, the review concludes with a strong recommendation against purchasing the product: \\"Don't buy it.

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor.

Why are there different types of clouds, then?\\n\\nHelpful Assistant: Well, just like you have different types of toys, there are different types of clouds! They come in all shapes and sizes, and their shapes depend on a few things, like how high they are in the sky, the temperature, and the amount of water vapor.

By becoming aware of these risk factors, you can better recognize when a young person needs additional support, guidance, or therapy to prevent violent outcomes.","response":"Some of these risk factors can include, but are not limited to, a history of abuse or neglect, exposure to violence at home or in the community, social isolation, involvement in gangs or criminal activity, drug or alcohol abuse, mental health issues, and lack of access to mental health support, resources or positive role models.\\n\\nTo address these risk factors, it's essential to foster a supportive and inclusive school environment that encourages open communication, understanding, and empathy among all members of the school community. Establishing a safe space for students to express their thoughts, emotions, and concerns will provide them with a sense of belonging and help reduce feelings of isolation that can often lead to anger and violence.\\n\\nIn addition, schools should consider implementing programs that promote emotional wellbeing and resilience, such as conflict resolution workshops, peer mediation, mental health awareness initiatives, and diversity and inclusion training. Providing students with tools to manage their emotions, learn effective communication, and connect with their peers will undoubtedly contribute to a culture of respect and mutual understanding.\\n\\nEngaging parents, caregivers, and other family members in the process is also a crucial aspect of preventing school violence. Many times, they can provide valuable insights into their child's behavior and emotional well-being. By fostering a partnership between the school and home, educators and families can work together to identify potential risk factors, respond to concerning signs, or address any issues that may arise.\\n\\nThe school should also collaborate with local law enforcement, community organizations, and mental health professionals to establish protocols for responding to and preventing instances of violence. This partnership will ensure that schools have access to resources and expertise to help create a comprehensive plan for violence prevention and intervention.\\n\\nOne essential component of any violence prevention plan is regular monitoring and evaluation. It's necessary to continuously assess the effectiveness of implemented programs, strategies, and policies, making changes as needed to ensure that they are effectively addressing the identified risk factors and mitigating the potential for violence.\\n\\nLastly, it's essential to empower students themselves to take action and become part of the solution. Encourage young people to stand up against bullying and promote respect, inclusivity, and kindness both within and outside of the school environment. By training students to become upstanders and fostering a sense of responsibility to look out for one another, schools can create a strong foundation for a more harmonious and violence-free community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by taking a proactive and multifaceted approach to preventing school violence, schools can help mitigate the risk factors that might contribute to violent behaviors in young people. By fostering awareness, understanding, and support within the school community, and collaborating with families, law enforcement, and mental health professionals, schools will move closer to creating an environment where students can grow, learn, and thrive free from the fear of violence."},{"question":"Answer the following question: This article: A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic.

As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional rhetoric and view literature as \\"symbolic action.\\" Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc.\\n\\nHe was born on May 5 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Peabody High School, where his friend Malcolm Cowley was also a student. While he attended Ohio State University to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the Boar's Head Society. Due to the constraining learning environment, however, Burke also left Columbia, never receiving a college diploma. In Greenwich Village he kept company with avant-garde writers such as Hart Crane, Malcolm Cowley, Gorham Munson, and later Allen Tate. Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic.  In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock (1922-1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine The Dial in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the Dial Award in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of The Nation from 1934-1936, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935.  His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight. As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including Bennington College, while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at Pennsylvania State University's Special Collections Library. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an autodidact and a self-taught scholar.  In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson Harry Chapin, a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in Andover, New Jersey.\\n\\nWhere did he teach the most?","response":"Kenneth Burke taught and lectured at various colleges, but one place he spent time teaching was Bennington College."},{"question":"Question: Given this review: \\"Love it\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a $42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between $700,000 and $1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. \\n\\nQuestion: \\"How much is the registration fee hike and what is cited as the reason for the lack of generated funds?\\"\\n\\nResponse: \\"The $49 dollar hike is due to the lagging economy, low interest rates not regerating enough revenue to cover services?\\"\\nPick from:\\n 1). no;\\n 2). yes;\\nDoes the response correctly answer the question?\\n\\n","response":"The registration fee hike is, indeed, proposed to be $49, broken down into two separate measures - a $42 increase aimed at supporting pro-bono services and an additional $7 to assist lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The reason cited for the lack of generated funds is the combination of low interest rates and a struggling economy, which has resulted in less money being generated through the Lawyers' Trust Fund.

For Derrick, taking on the role of Kevin’s mentor allowed him to share his knowledge and expertise, thereby reinforcing his own skills and understanding of fitness and exercise techniques. This act of teaching can also foster a sense of personal satisfaction, pride, and responsibility, as Derrick has the opportunity to positively impact the lives of others.\\n\\nFor Kevin, this relationship provided a supportive, educational environment in which to learn from Derrick's expertise, practice new skills, and receive continuous feedback and encouragement.

Under 100 words is a good title length.\\nQ: In an influenza pandemic, the benefit of vaccines and antiviral medications will be constrained by limitations on supplies and effectiveness. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will therefore be vital in curtailing disease spread. However, the most comprehensive assessments of the literature to date recognize the generally poor quality of evidence on which to base non-pharmaceutical pandemic planning decisions. In light of the need to prepare for a possible pandemic despite concerns about the poor quality of the literature, combining available evidence with expert opinion about the relative merits of non-pharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza may lead to a more informed and widely accepted set of recommendations. We evaluated the evidence base for non-pharmaceutical public health interventions. Then, based on the collective evidence, we identified a set of recommendations for and against interventions that are specific to both the setting in which an intervention may be used and the pandemic phase, and which can be used by policymakers to prepare for a pandemic until scientific evidence can definitively respond to planners' needs. Methods: Building on reviews of past pandemics and recent historical inquiries, we evaluated the relative merits of nonpharmaceutical interventions by combining available evidence from the literature with qualitative and quantitative expert opinion. Specifically, we reviewed the recent scientific literature regarding the prevention of human-to-human transmission of pandemic influenza, convened a meeting of experts from multiple disciplines, and elicited expert recommendation about the use of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions in a variety of settings (healthcare facilities; community-based institutions; private households) and pandemic phases (no pandemic; no US pandemic; early localized US pandemic; advanced US pandemic).\\nA: ","response":"\\"Integrating Evidence and Expert Opinion for Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in Pandemic Influenza Planning: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach\\""},{"question":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Olly Pickering and Murray (Jacob Moriarty and Callum Williams) become best friends when they were little until Olly goes to university.

In all the confusion of locking down the museum and capturing the robbers, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) slips into an adjacent room and steals the painting of San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk by Monet. The insurers of the $100 million artwork send investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) to assist NYPD Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) in solving the crime. In reviewing video of the rooms involved in both robberies, one of which was strangely \\"blank\\", Banning follows clues to discover how both robberies are connected. She quickly comes to suspect that the wealthy financier Thomas Crown is behind the theft. Banning is intrigued at his motivations and begins a game of cat-and-mouse to recover the painting. Despite the fact that both of them intuitively know what the other is up to, the two of them continue to meet in high class locations and intimate surroundings while Banning continues to search for the painting. The constant contact, matching of wits (and the romantic pursuit of Crown), cause Banning to fall in love with him. But her commitment to her job and her doubts about Crown's true intentions make her hesitate. To prove his love to her, Crown promises to return the stolen artwork to the museum. In her doubt, Banning betrays Crown's plan to Detective McCann who fills the museum with dozens of police officers in an attempt to catch him in the act. After a grand game of misdirection, the painting is returned and another one is stolen; one which Banning had previously expressed a desire to possess. Since the second stolen painting is insured by another company and her job is now finished, Banning's knowledge of Crown's plan allows her to meet him at a prearranged spot. But the person she meets instead convinces her that her betrayal has cost her more than she can bear. Crown's witty nature ultimately allows for both him and Banning to run away and live happily...

Article: Can dogs help with OCD? You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks  at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms   are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs   and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers   of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample   and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers   and German shepherds   were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes   can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications   that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically   close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader... Question: According to the study, OCD   _  . Answer:\\nA:","response":"According to the study, OCD can be caused by genes and is influenced by diet, with certain vitamins and minerals potentially being helpful in treatment.

This step is optional. However, it is very useful in understanding network topologies.  You need a good understanding of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP and HTTP before you start programming distributed applications.  For Windows-based programming, that would be any script that works with Windows Scripting Host. For Linux-based programming, Bash scripts and Perl will be sufficient. JavaScript is strongly recommended for this in both platforms for the following reasons:  It is supported by almost any scripting host in any operating system (Windows Scripting Host supports JavaScript by default, most Linux distributions has a package for JavaScript scripting console support). It is considered to be easier to learn by many developers. It has an ALGOL derived syntax which familiarizes you with much more other programming languages when you need to choose a second programming language (C, C++, C#, Java and J# all have ALGOL derived syntax). By learning JavaScript, you familiarize yourself with client-side scripting of web pages which is a bonus side-effect! Later, you can use more advanced programming techniques and paradigms according to your scripting language and what it supports. All scripting languages have some procedural programming aspects at some level. Learn what is necessary for doing that. Simple communications will suffice. Preferably, one that is a multi-paradigm language such as Python. Take a simple introduction to that second language. Java is considered by most programmers to be the language of choice for many reasons. However, C# is gaining momentum fast in this field. Java and C# are preferred for the following reasons:  They are object oriented programming languages which shields programmers in large teams from implementation details as they both supports components (units of code, pre-compiled, that perform a certain task and can be used in other programs). They support event-driven programming, as well as OO and procedural programming at some level. The framework that the language is built upon is distributed by nature (in the case of Java). The availability of many ready-made packages that deal with networking, both as open-source code and framework built-in packages; this makes it easier for programmers to build upon the work of others. more on the core features of the language, especially those supporting networking. Pay less attention to user-interface elements such as outputting, window design and techniques, and user-interface elements. This can be done using books, online tutorials or academic courses. However, understanding the architecture of distributed applications and its concepts is necessary.  It is recommended that you get at least an introduction to all of them. Most distributed application programmers do not stop at one or two programming languages, but learn at least one programming language on each operating system. That is because if you want your application to be \\"distributed\\", you should provide a version of it at least for each major operating system.
