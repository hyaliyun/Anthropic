Title: The Painted Veil Movie plot: On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese woman in relative opulence. Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of taking a very deep breath can have an effect on the process. When a person takes a very deep breath, a larger amount of air is transported to the lungs, increasing the volume of air in the alveoli. This increased volume of air can potentially lead to a higher concentration of gaseous oxygen available to dissolve into the capillary blood. As a result, more oxygen can be picked up by red blood cells, leading to increased oxygen delivery to the body's cells.

To do this, you would need to get rid of the constant (-32) from the left side of the equation. Add 32 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant. -62*v - 32 + 32 = 30 + 32 -62*v = 62 2. Now you have isolated the term with the variable v (-62*v). To find the value of v, you need to divide both sides of the equation by -62.

Answer: Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared\\". A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPT: * yes * no","response":"To determine the cost of incentives for producing solar energy, several factors must be taken into consideration. A comprehensive analysis of the elements that impact the incentives, the potential environmental and economic benefits, and the long-term trajectory of solar development will provide a better understanding of what these costs should entail. 1. Market Conditions: The current state of the solar energy market should be taken into account when calculating incentives' costs. The demand for solar energy and the competition within the industry play a crucial role in assessing the incentives' level needed to encourage production. 2. Technological Advancements: Rapid advancements in solar technology will affect the cost of incentives. As solar technology becomes more efficient and cost-effective, the incentives required to promote solar energy production will decline. Continual assessments of technological advancements must be considered to strike a balance in incentivizing production while not over-subsidizing it. 3. Environmental Benefits: Solar energy offers significant environmental advantages over fossil fuels, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing air pollution. The cost of incentives should reflect these benefits to ensure that the incentives' price properly accounts for the long-term positive impact solar energy has on the environment. 4. Economic Benefits: Expanding the solar energy sector creates employment opportunities and fosters economic growth. Incentives' costs should be considered in the context of their potential to generate new jobs and stimulate economic activity, thereby having a positive effect on the overall economy. 5. Infrastructure and Grid Integration: The expansion of solar energy production challenges the existing power grid infrastructure. The integration of solar energy into the grid requires investment, affecting the cost of incentives. This factor must be taken into account to ensure that incentives not only encourage solar production but also facilitate its integration into the existing energy system. 6. Learning and Knowledge Sharing: As solar energy production scales up, the industry will accumulate significant knowledge and expertise that can be further leveraged to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Incentives should consider the value of this learning process and encourage knowledge sharing among different stakeholders. 7. Government Policies and Regulations: The cost of incentives will be influenced by the existing regulatory environment and government policies surrounding solar energy. Countries with progressive policies promoting clean energy are more likely to have lower incentive costs, as their existing policies may already partially address the challenge of fostering solar production. 8. Social Acceptance and Equity: Public opinion plays a crucial role in the success of solar energy incentives. Any policy must consider the acceptance of such incentives by the general population and address any concerns related to equality and distribution of benefits. 9. Long-Term Trajectory: Solar energy's long-term trajectory should be taken into account when determining incentives' costs. Incentives should be designed to assist in the achievement of long-term renewable energy goals and the mitigation of climate change impacts. The cost of incentives should be balanced with the expected long-term benefits to society and the environment. In conclusion, the cost of incentives for producing solar energy should be considered through a holistic analysis that encompasses the various factors that impact solar energy development. By evaluating these factors and balancing the incentives in the context of environmental, economic, technological, and social considerations, a more accurate and effective cost determination can be made to foster sustainable energy production."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - Amanda Leigh \\"Mandy\\" Moore (born April 10, 1984) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","response":"Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Find the population of Auburn, New York. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2020, the population of Auburn, New York is estimated to be around 26,000 residents. Step 2: Determine the seating capacity of Tropicana Field. Tropicana Field, which is located in St. Petersburg, Florida, is a baseball stadium primarily used for professional baseball games. Its seating capacity for such games is approximately 25,000 spectators. However, for other events, like concerts, the seating capacity can be increased to around 42,000 people. Step 3: Compare the population of Auburn, New York, to the seating capacity of Tropicana Field. Now that we have the population of Auburn, New York (26,000 residents), and the seating capacity of Tropicana Field (25,000-42,000 spectators), we can compare the two numbers. For baseball games, Tropicana Field's capacity (25,000) is slightly less than the population of Auburn, New York (26,000). This implies that every resident of Auburn, New York, would not be able to fit into Tropicana Field simultaneously if only seated spectators were considered for the maximum capacity. However, if we look at the increased capacity during concerts and other events (42,000), then it becomes apparent that all 26,000 residents of Auburn, New York, could be accommodated easily at Tropicana Field. Conclusion: Yes, you can fit every resident of Auburn, New York, in Tropicana Field, provided that the field's seating capacity is increased to the maximum available (as in concerts and other events)."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

FACE A:","response":"Title: Facing the Truth Genre: Drama, Mystery, Thriller Plot: Act 1: The story begins with Tony Costello (played by Mark Ruffalo), a successful lawyer in a bustling city, seemingly living a perfect life, with a beautiful wife, two lovely kids, and a luxurious penthouse. However, Tony is constantly haunted by a dark secret that threatens to destroy his carefully constructed world. As a young man, he was involved in a tragic accident that took the life of his best friend, Jack Richardson, who was shot in the face with Tony's own gun during a hunting trip gone wrong. Tony had never forgiven himself and had not told anyone about the fatal encounter, as he fears his career and personal life will fall apart. Act 2: Tony's carefully concealed past suddenly resurfaces when he receives a cryptic note reading, \\"WHERE DOES TONY SHOOT HIMSELF? FACE.\\" It's accompanied by a photograph of Jack, as a chilling reminder of his guilt. The anonymous sender seems to know Tony's darkest secret and appears to be taunting him, pushing Tony into paranoia, fear, and eventually to take action. As he tries to figure out who could be responsible for the malicious correspondence, Tony comes across a series of people from his past: Jack's younger sister, Lucy Richardson (played by Michelle Williams), who has been investigating the real reason behind her brother's death, a mysterious private detective, Frank Murdoch (played by Daniel Craig), secretly hired by Lucy to look into Tony, and a disgruntled and resentful ex-client of Tony's, Robert Simmons (played by Aaron Paul), who seeks vengeance for losing a high-profile case. Act 3: A series of twists and turns continuously cast doubt on each character's potential guilt. Tony becomes increasingly obsessed with solving the mystery and confronts both Lucy and Robert about his suspicions. Lucy admits her initial plan was to expose Tony but then reveals she discovered that another person could have been present during the tragic accident, explaining her decision to halt her efforts. Meanwhile, Robert vehemently denies any involvement and sincerely pleads with Tony to see through the lies and deceit that have shrouded his conscience before it's too late. In the climax, Tony uncovers the truth: private detective Frank Murdoch had been behind the note all along, blackmailing him in an attempt to extort a hefty sum and settle old scores – scores from long ago, when he had been falsely accused and imprisoned for a crime Tony had represented him on and lost. Consumed with vengeance, Frank orchestrates a final showdown for Tony, forcing him to face his guilt head-on and confess the truth before he can go free. Act 4: In the final act, Tony acknowledges that the secret had pushed him to the edge of his sanity, prompting him to finally come to terms with his guilt and confess. The movie ends with Tony shooting himself in the face with the same gun that killed Jack – thereby confronting the literal meaning of the cryptic note. He survives the gunshot but ends up permanently disfigured and wheelchair-bound. As the curtain falls, Tony decides to come clean with his family and the authorities, while Lucy, Frank, Robert, and everyone else affected by his past actions grapple with the fallout of a sinful secret left buried for too long."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: field, road, way","response":"As an AI assistant, I'm instructed to generate detailed and long answers. Therefore, one concise sentence may be a bit contrary to the task definition. Still, I'll provide a comprehensive insight to add more substance and complexity to the sentence about a field, road, and a way that connects and drives the core idea about these three elements. The verdant field, settled in the heart of the countryside, was a symbol of fertility and tranquility, its lush green carpet of swaying wheat extending as far as the eye could see, bringing a sense of serenity that seemed far removed from the bustling activity of the city. On the periphery of this agricultural wonder, nestled a well-worn road, that had seen the passage of both time and myriad sojourner wheels, marked by traits of countless journeys. It was not just a physical path of worn-out gravel and occasional potholes but also reflected stories and histories of adventures undertaken and journeys embarked upon by generations of travelers. The road, providing a stark contrast against the adjacent greenery, intervened the field and the urban peripheries, extending the invitation of connectivity in terms of commerce, communication and companionship between rural and urban worlds. It snaked its way through the field, like a silent observer, watching the cyclic dances of life - the seeding, growth, harvest, and renewal stages, and all the intertwined human life dramas played across the seasons. The notion of the 'way' surfaces heavily here; it's not just about the physical path, but rather the overarching journey. It represents the myriad interpretations of life's path, the philosophical dimensions of existence, choices and decisions, discoveries, experiences and relationships that all intersect and play out in the grand drama of life. It is a metaphor for life's journey itself whereupon the road we travel, the field is our environment, the choices we make and the pathways we choose culminate into the way of our existence. Thus, the field, road, and way, interconnected, offer a narrative of existence and experience that encompasses the physicality of our environment, the journey we undertake, and the philosophical paths we negotiate in the grand schema of life. With every destination that the road touches, every stimulus that the field provides and every decision that forms the way, they together narrate the complexity and intricacy of the human journey, a journey embarked upon across time and generations."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army.

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken.

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Possible A: tropical forest, walmart, north america, feild, pet shops Why is \\"pet shops\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","response":"\\"Pet shops\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because pet shops are specialized retail stores dedicated to selling various types of animals, including snakes, as well as related pet supplies and accessories. People often head to pet shops to purchase pets like dogs, cats, fish, and smaller animals such as hamsters or guinea pigs. Similarly, pet shops carry various species of snakes that have been bred and raised in captivity, ensuring they are safe and suitable for keeping as pets. The other options, such as \\"tropical forest,\\" \\"Walmart,\\" \\"North America,\\" and \\"field,\\" do not align with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Tropical forest: While some snake species do inhabit tropical forests, capturing a snake from its natural habitat can be dangerous and is often unethical, potentially harming the animal and disrupting the ecosystem. Additionally, capturing and keeping wild snakes is illegal in many jurisdictions. 2. Walmart: Walmart is a large retail chain that sells a wide variety of goods, including groceries, clothing, and household items, but they do not typically sell live animals, specifically snakes. 3. North America: This refers to a continent rather than a specific type of establishment or location where one would reasonably expect to be able to purchase a snake. 4.

This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. and the situation: Matthew is training to run a marathon. Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal. Answer the following question: Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running? Answer:","response":"Breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. This is because the body needs more oxygen to support the energy demand during the activity, which in turn facilitates cellular respiration to produce ATP molecules for energy."},{"question":"Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: How long did it take the author to fully recover from the surgical mishap?

Rand Paul and Ted Cruz along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and possibly others. There could be three or more Republicans still standing after Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina given fissures between social conservatives and more libertarian-leaning Republicans like Paul. Bush will look to slam the door on all of them in early March when a pile of states, including the governor's native Florida, vote on Super Tuesday. Read MoreWhat to expect from Washington, or NOT, in 2015 To get there, Bush will have to sell early voters on his policies on immigration and education, which could prove challenging. But he will have more than enough money—Bush is in Greenwich, Connecticut, this week raising cash for his newly launched super PAC—to saturate the early state airwaves and then keep rolling when the race goes national. Bush will also bank on the strong desire at the top of the GOP to avoid a long, bruising primary process that would badly damage the party's standard bearer while Clinton is presumably waltzing to the Democratic nomination. And there is no longer much doubt that Bush is getting in the race. He spent the holiday break winding down all his corporate and nonprofit ties. He is also preparing to exit the multiple investment funds he set up over the last several years. He is preparing to release an e-book that will presumably contain the general themes of his campaign. Bush could still have a major change of heart and decide not to get in, but that seems increasingly unlikely. Read MoreLook for Dems to battle for party's future in 2015 Should he make it through the primaries, Bush would likely face off again Hillary Clinton. Clinton won't necessarily have the coronation many expect, given that Iowa activists are already actively pining for a challenger. But outside of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, there is no obvious candidate on the left who could mount a credible challenge to Clinton. Warren still says she is not running and she probably won't. But if she does, she could compete with and even beat Clinton in Iowa. But chances are she could not roll up further victories. She could, however, force Clinton left on economic policy in ways that could make the general election tougher for the former secretary of state and New York senator. While it is true that Clinton was also viewed as inevitable in 2008, it is also true that there is no Barack Obama waiting in the political wings to take her down. So barring a major surprise, the 2016 race will pit Clinton against whoever emerges from a crowded GOP field. At the beginning of 2015, that looks like it could be John Ellis \\"Jeb\\" Bush.

What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the 2016 presidential campaign, specifically focusing on Jeb Bush's plans and strategies. The article highlights the following: 1. Bush's initial goal is to consolidate establishment GOP (Grand Old Party, or Republican Party) support quickly and take down his rivals, such as Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, and Mitt Romney, to be the favorite candidate for the Republican nomination. 2. Bush then aims to face the top movement conservative candidates, which could include Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal, and others, emerging from the early primaries in Iowa and other states. 3. Bush will focus on early March's primaries (particularly in his native state, Florida) to solidify his position as the frontrunner. 4. To appeal to voters, Bush will need to sell his policies on immigration and education -- potentially challenging, but with the advantage of significant campaign funding behind him. 5. The article also suggests that Bush is fully committed to entering the race, given that he has been winding down corporate and nonprofit ties and preparing to release an e-book outlining his campaign themes. 6.

Options are: + Yes; + No; The answer is:","response":"No. The correct answer to the question of what allows an organism to create offspring both sexually and asexually is not \\"remains of prehistoric life\\". Remains of prehistoric life refers to fossils or preserved evidence of living organisms from earlier geological periods. This does not have a direct relation to the sexual or asexual reproduction methods of contemporary organisms. The question is most likely referring to the biological process known as the alternation of generations. This complex life cycle is found in some plants and algae. During this cycle, the organism alternates between a sexual phase (the gametophyte, producing gametes) and an asexual phase (the sporophyte, producing spores). Let's elaborate to make this clearer. During the gametophyte phase of the life cycle, the plant or algae reproduces sexually. Gametes (sperm and egg cells) are produced, which combine during fertilization to create a new organism with a full set of genetic information (a zygote), half provided by each parent. This zygote will grow into a mature sporophyte. Then, during the sporophyte phase, the plant or algae reproduces asexually. Special cells (spores) are produced through a process called meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes. These spores can grow into new organisms (gametophytes) without the need for fertilization. Therefore, the process that allows for an organism to create offspring by both sexual and asexual means is the alternation of generations, not the remains of prehistoric life."},{"question":"2 focus wing ds/external corner (incl. in external corner kit, see installation guide) How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","response":"To correctly capitalize the given sentence, consider the following steps: 1.

Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"No, the statement \\"Marie Curie invented the atomic bomb\\" is not a verifiable fact. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to understand why: 1. Marie Curie was a pioneering scientist who made significant contributions to the field of radioactivity. Born in 1867, she conducted groundbreaking research in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ultimately winning two Nobel Prizes for her work in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). 2. Marie Curie's research primarily focused on understanding radioactivity, the spontaneous emission of radiation from certain materials. She even coined the term \\"radioactivity\\" itself. Her work laid the foundation for our understanding of radioactive elements such as radium and polonium, which she discovered. 3. The discovery of radioactivity and the properties of radioactive elements were important for the development of atomic science. Marie Curie's work laid the groundwork for future scientific advancements, but she neither invented nor contributed directly to the development of the atomic bomb. 4. The development of the atomic bomb, also known as the Manhattan Project, took place during World War II and involved the collaboration of thousands of scientists and engineers from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The Manhattan Project was led by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who is often referred to as the \\"Father of the Atomic Bomb.\\" 5. Marie Curie died in 1934, nearly a decade before the start of the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb.

Allowing customers to collect parcels on a Sunday for the first time is the latest in a number of changes introduced by the company. Royal Mail, which was part-privatised last year, is facing competition from business rivals such Amazon. Royal Mail said its decision to open some delivery offices on Sundays would make it easier for people who shop online, but are not normally home during the day, to get their goods. The offices, which are located across the UK, will be open between 12:00 and 16:00 on Sundays. The company is also launching some Sunday delivery services, to addresses within the M25 area. Royal Mail spokesman Mike Newnham said it was about making things easier for customers. \\"In the last year or so we've launched our Delivery to Neighbour service, we've opened up about 600 of our delivery offices on a Wednesday evening to provide more convenience, and also we've launched the country's largest click-and-collect service in conjunction with the Post Office,\\" he said. Royal Mail's Delivery to Neighbour service involves items being delivered to a neighbouring address for collection if the intended recipient is not at home. Parcel deliveries account for more than half of Royal Mail's revenues but it is facing increasing competition from rival operators such as online retailer Amazon which began offering Sunday deliveries earlier this year. Analysts believe the growing popularity of so-called click-and-collect services, which allow goods to be ordered online before being picked up at local stores or collection points, is also having a significant effect on the parcels business. Last month, Royal Mail said it was bringing forward the final collection times at thousands of post boxes in order to save money. Royal Mail's network of about 1,400 delivery offices is currently open six days a week. Nick Landon, managing director of Royal Mail Parcels, said: \\"We are continuing to be more customer responsive and provide more options for people to receive items they have ordered online. \\"I am delighted to pilot Sunday afternoon opening at around 100 of our delivery offices across the UK with the highest parcel volumes, and Sunday deliveries to addresses within the M25 motorway.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","response":"Royal Mail is introducing Sunday parcel deliveries in the London area and opening around 100 delivery offices across the UK on Sundays between 12:00 and 16:00.

The band was the first major American rock group to have an \\"integrated, multi-gender\\" lineup. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1943, Denton, Texas) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock, and psychedelia in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - Larry Graham, Jr. (born August 14, 1946) is an American bass guitar player, both with the psychedelic soul/funk band Sly and the Family Stone, and as the founder and frontman of Graham Central Station.

He has been blind since shortly after birth. - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. - A chord progression or harmonic progression is a succession of musical chords. Chord progressions are the foundation of harmony in Western musical tradition. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Rose \`\` Rosie '' Stone ( born Rosemary Stewart ; March 21 , 1945 ) is an African - American singer and keyboardist .

Ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords are extended chords. The thirteenth is the farthest extension diatonically possible as, by that point, all seven tonal degrees are represented within the chord. In practice however, extended chords do not typically use all the chord members; when it is not altered, the fifth is often omitted, as are notes between the seventh and the highest note (i.e., the ninth is often omitted in an eleventh chord; the ninth and eleventh are usually omitted in a thirteenth chord), unless they are altered to give a special texture. See chord alteration. - The Supremes were an American female singing group and the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s. Founded as the Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, HollandDozierHolland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and it is said that their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success. - A melody (\\"singing, chanting\\"), also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. It may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A keyboardist is a musician who plays keyboard instruments. Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either pianists or organists. Since the mid-1960s, a plethora of new musical instruments with keyboards have come into common usage, requiring a more general term for a person who plays them. These keyboards include: - Freddie Stone (born Frederick Stewart, June 5, 1947, Vallejo, California, United States) is an African-American pastor and musician, best known for his role as co-founder, guitarist, and vocalist in the band Sly and the Family Stone, the frontman for which was his brother Sly Stone.

The band and its sister act Parliament, both led by George Clinton, pioneered the funk music culture of that decade. - Psychedelia is a name given to the subculture of people, originating in the 1960s, who often use psychedelic drugs such as LSD, mescaline and peyote. The term is also used to describe a style of psychedelic artwork and psychedelic music. Psychedelic art and music typically try to recreate or reflect the experience of altered consciousness. Psychedelic art uses highly distorted and surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke and convey to a viewer or listener the artist's experience while using such drugs, or to enhance the experience of a user of these drugs. Psychedelic music uses distorted electric guitar, Indian music elements such as the sitar, electronic effects, sound effects and reverberation, and elaborate studio effects, such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to another. The term \\"psychedelic\\" is derived from the Ancient Greek words \\"psych\\" (, \\"soul\\") and \\"dloun\\" (, \\"to make visible, to reveal\\"), translating to \\"soul-revealing\\". - Bebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features songs characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales and occasional references to the melody. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Denton is a city in and the county seat of Denton County, Texas. As of the 2010 United States Census, its population was 113,383, making it the 27th most populous city in Texas and the 11th-largest city in the DallasFort Worth metroplex. - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations.

It came to prominence in the late 1960s and continued into the 1970s, playing a major role in the development of funk and disco. Pioneering acts included Sly and the Family Stone and the Temptations. Mainstream acts that developed a psychedelic sound included the Supremes and Stevie Wonder. Acts that achieved notability with the sound included The Chambers Brothers, The 5th Dimension, Edwin Starr and George Clinton's Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles. - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. - Edwin Starr (January 21, 1942April 2, 2003) was an American soul singer.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

After news of it spreads across town, a Catholic priest named Father Richard Moore is arrested and sent to court. The archdiocese wishes for Father Moore to plead guilty, in order for publicity of the incident to be minimized. A lawyer named Erin Bruner is provided to Father Moore to negotiate a plea deal, but Father Moore insists on pleading not guilty. Bruner takes the case, believing it will elevate her to senior partner at her law firm. Father Moore agrees to let her defend him only if he is allowed to tell Emily's story. The trial begins with the calling of several medical experts by the prosecutor Ethan Thomas, and Judge Brewster presiding. One expert testifies that Emily was suffering from both epilepsy and psychosis. The defense contests that she may have actually been possessed but Bruner explains that Emily was suffering from something that neither medicine nor psychology could explain, and that Father Moore as well as her family realized this and tried to help in another way. Several flashbacks reveal the story leading up to the exorcism. Emily gets a scholarship to a university to study for a bachelor's degree in education. After days pass, strange events occur. In her dorm room one night, at 3:00 AM, Emily smells a strange burning smell from the hallway. Attempting to investigate it, she sees a door open and shut itself several times. She then sees a writing material jar move by itself. Emily sees her bed covers roll themselves down, and a great weight pins her in bed along with a force which also proceeds to choke her and seemingly to possess her momentarily.

Answer the above question based on the context below: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in... A:","response":"The first name of the person who was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl\\" is Barbara. This refers to Barbara Peache, the long-term girlfriend of Heseltine, who was a part of a bohemian household at Eynsford with a dynamic population of artists, musicians, and friends. This household was co-presided over by Heseltine and Moeran, a fellow resident who also studied at the Royal College of Music and was an avid collector of folk music. They had a lot in common, but rarely worked together, despite co-writing a song called \\"Maltworms\\". It's safe to say that Barbara played a significant role within this community, as her character contrasted the wild and bohemian nature of their lifestyle. Eric Fenby describes her as unlike Heseltine's usual preferences, indicating that despite the uninhibited behaviour and lifestyle she was surrounded by, Barbara stayed true to her nature, retaining her quiet and attractive persona. In addition to Barbara, there were other residents such as Hal Collins, William Walton, Constant Lambert, Nina Hamnett, amongst others, all contributing to the vibrant and diverse nature of this household. Despite the unconventional behaviour, including drunken parties and orgies, much work was still accomplished in the household, including numerous musical settings and compositions. Regardless of the wild living and debauchery, it was also a place for artistic expression, with members such as Heseltine continuing to transcribe early music, write articles and criticism, and finishing the book on Gesualdo. The unconventional setting did not detract from the creative pursuits of its residents, instead, it seemed to fuel their artistic expression, defining an era of unfettered creativity amidst chaos."},{"question":"Two groups of patients were under observation for heart disease.

The Gaelic system was disrupted by the English peerage in the early modern period by confiscations deemed illegal in Continental courts at the time. The latter system consists of those titles of nobility created by the English monarchs in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland, or later by monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The English ranks of the Irish peerage are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron, whilst the Irish system uses Gaelic titles, in accordance with a genealogy of the Ard Rí (High King of Ireland) chronicled in numerous ancient manuscripts, including the Annals of the Four Masters. The Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland continues to exercise jurisdiction over its Peerage of Ireland, but not those peers whose titles derive from places located in what is now the Republic of Ireland. Importantly, Article 40.2 of the Irish Constitution forbids conference of titles of nobility by anyone but the Uatarán -- President of the Republic -- and a citizen may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Government. Gaelic titles of nobility, amongst the oldest in European history, remain the providence of individual clanna or families. Efforts are underway to accord these system with the laws of the Supreme Court of Ireland in friendly negotiation with English conventions and European law. - Thomas Pakenham , 2nd Earl of Longford KP ( 14 May 1774 -- 28 May 1835 ) , known as The Lord Longford between 1792 and 1794 , was an Anglo - Irish peer . Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'country of citizenship' with 'ireland'. The answer is:","response":"Thomas Pakenham, 2nd Earl of Longford, has the relation 'country of citizenship' with 'Ireland'. This is because he was an Anglo-Irish peer, indicating that he had both Irish and British heritage. The Earl of Longford title was created within the Peerage of Ireland, further connecting his citizenship to Ireland. Additionally, he was known as The Lord Longford, which also associates him with Ireland. Although the Peerage of Ireland is under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the fact that Thomas Pakenham held a title within the system ties him to Ireland as his country of citizenship."},{"question":"Translate to French: Increasingly, they depend on the provision of other services, inter alia credit advance, quality control and standard setting, advertising, management of inventories, and after-sale servicing.","response":"De plus en plus, ils dépendent de la fourniture d'autres services, entre autres l'avance de crédit, le contrôle de qualité et l'établissement de normes, la publicité, la gestion des stocks, et le service après-vente.

There are 6 episodes in the Pride and Prejudice mini-series. Step 2: Determine the length of each episode. Each episode is 50 minutes long. Step 3: Calculate the total minutes spent watching the series. To do this, we multiply the total number of episodes (6) by the length of each episode (50 minutes). Total minutes = 6 episodes * 50 minutes per episode = 300 minutes Step 4: Convert the total minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 300 minutes by dividing it by 60 minutes per hour.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Payback Context: In a filthy kitchen of an underground abortionist, an unkempt former medical doctor puts on surgical gloves and quickly downs a full glass of cheap whiskey. Face down on the kitchen table is a barely conscious Porter (Mel Gibson), severely wounded with two large bullet wounds in his back. The doctor pours whiskey on Porter's back to sterilize the area and digs out the bullets. Porter spends five months recuperating. Porter narrates that he had 70,000 taken from him and that is what he was going to get back. Porter begins tracking down gangster Val Resnick (Gregg Henry), his violent former partner, and Lynn (Deborah Unger), his estranged wife and a heroin addict, both of whom betrayed Porter following a 140,000 heist from the local Chinese triads. After Lynn shot Porter and the two left him for dead, Val rejoined the Outfit, a powerful criminal organization, using 130,000 of the heist money to repay an outstanding debt. Porter is intent on reclaiming his 70,000 cut. Porter first tracks down and confronts his wife Lynn, who has at this point become a prostitute out of shame of shooting him. After seeing how low she has sunk into drugs and prostitution, Porter takes pity on Lynn and confines her to her bedroom, only to discover the next day that she has died from a heroin overdose. (Whether Lynn's overdose was a suicide or an accident is never made clear). Porter enlists the help of a call girl, named Rosie (Maria Bello), who is affiliated with the Outfit. Porter once served as her limo driver, during which time they had a one-night stand. Lynn's jealousy and the fact that Porter had cheated on her with Rosie led to her and Resnick double-crossing Porter. To get to Resnick, Porter must deal with a lowlife drug dealer and gambler named Arthur Stegman (David Paymer), crime bosses from the Outfit, the Chinese triads, and two corrupt police detectives named Hicks and Leary (Bill Duke and Jack Conley).

By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was.

GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Police telling us it will take days to process the gruesome crime scene, 26 people, 20 just mere children slaughtered inside the elementary school. Now, we spoke with Connecticut State Police Lieutenant Paul Vance. VAN SUSTEREN: Nice to see you, sir. LT. PAUL VANCE, CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE: Thank you very having us. VAN SUSTEREN: Lieutenant, you know, we've seen so many of these across the country and going back even as long as Columbine and before that. You never think it's going to happen in your own community, do you. VANCE: No, you don't. This is something that is horrific, it's tragic. These parents sent these children to school today to be educated and they never expected never to see them again. And it's just a heartbreaking tragedy that this community's enduring. VAN SUSTEREN: And you think right now -- you haven't identified all the bodies for the families, have you. VANCE: We have not. We have tentative identification. We have a process where we have to positively identify everyone, and we want certainly to do that as expeditiously as possible. We're working on that as we speak right now. We'll work right through the night. It's important for the families and we understand that. VAN SUSTEREN: But just imagine, you're home tonight and you haven't gotten the official word, but your child isn't home, so you know that your child was one of the victims. I mean, it's inevitable. I mean, imagine that pain. VANCE: It's -- it's unbelievable. I mean, it's something that no one really ever wants to bear, and it was heartbreaking to have to hear the parents being told that their children were not coming home. It was heartbreaking for the law enforcement officers to go in to rescue as many people as they did, as many staffers as they did, and then encounter what they discovered in those last two classrooms. VAN SUSTEREN: Was the situation where the killer killed everybody in one single room, so that he killed an entire class? VANCE: No, it wasn't -- it wasn't like that, and it's even difficult to talk about. But suffice to say that, you know, there were deceased in two classrooms and the hallway, and it was a horrific scene. VAN SUSTEREN: Was he known to law enforcement? Because sometimes, these people who come in here and to that, you know, their names are familiar to law enforcement. They've been around. VANCE: We're looking at that. We have a State Police command investigation under way. We've brought in major crime detectives. We've had the Newtown police detectives working with us. And we're going to answer all those questions. We're going to do an extensive background on the shooter, going back as far as we need to go. We're going to answer every question about the history and historical -- any historical events that this young man may have been involved n. We'll leave no stone unturned. VAN SUSTEREN: Has the school indicated that they know him? Had his mother ever complained about him or said anything about him that she was worried about him? VANCE: There's nothing that showed that something like this could occur. But again, our investigators will look at all of that. We'll certainly interview all the administration of the school, superintendent, friends, family, relatives, co-workers. The list is endless, and we will certainly do everything we can to answer all those questions. VAN SUSTEREN: One thing that I was sort of curious -- I didn't quite understand, maybe you can clear it up for me, is that -- that I've read or heard that the mother was found dead at her home and that she's also a teacher. So was she not teaching now or was she not -- did she call in sick? Or why wasn't she at school today, do you know? VANCE: I've got to -- I've got to say we haven't identified officially anyone yet. So I'm in a position where I can tell you we have a secondary scene with a deceased female, who we tentatively have identified. And those are questions that we have and those are questions that we have to answer. And at this point in time, we haven't answered them yet. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, can you tell me whether there was a substitute teacher in that classroom? VANCE: That I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. VAN SUSTEREN: And so -- and right now, medical examiners in with those children and the adults? VANCE: Yes, the medical examiner's at the scene with a team, and he has his team in place and they're going to work right through the night. They're going to do whatever they need to do, again, to identify these children for these families. VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I can't -- you know, every time I've covered these stories, you know, the police officers, the law enforcement -- I mean, they're all parents. And you know, and they go into these scenes and it's, like, you know, it's -- it's unthinkable and unspeakable. I mean, they've all got kids these -- you know, the age of these children. VANCE: Yes. It's a very difficult scene for them. The law enforcement officers that entered that building, we've provided them with counseling. We have the briefers with them. We did the same for the family. We brought in clergy. It's hard. It's very hard for law enforcement, the fire service, EMS personnel, but certainly nothing like the parents are going through. VAN SUSTEREN: No, no parent wants to send his child to school that's essentially a prison and with a lot of metal detectors and security and everything else. But I'm curious. With this school, any security? Not that I'm any way condemning them if it hasn't because it -- you know, both -- it goes both ways. VANCE: Suffice it to say that the school was secure. It was very secure. And we will certainly determine exactly how the shooter was able to gain access. VAN SUSTEREN: Secure in a sense that if I tried to get in, somebody would stop me? Is it that kind of security? You've got -- someone's got to me in? VANCE: That's correct. You could not have gotten in. VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir, and good luck. I know it's tough on you, and everybody in the community, especially the families of the dead. Thank you, sir.","response":"\\"Connecticut School Tragedy: A Heartbreaking Scene Unfolds - An Interview with Lt. Paul Vance\\""},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3. Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: How old was Jack Matheson when Jim was born? Passage 1:Matheson was born on April 7, 1949 in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Jack and Peggy Matheson. Matheson had an intention to follow the footsteps of his father, Jack, a long-time sports editor for the Winnipeg Tribune. He graduated from the University of Manitoba with a degree in political science, and while in school, worked a part-time night shift with the Tribune. He got his first job upon completing school with the Regina Leader-Post, but moved west to Edmonton, Alberta six months later. Upon moving to Edmonton, Matheson got a job with the Edmonton Journal in 1970. He initially covered local curling and university sports, but quickly switched to hockey, when, in 1973, Edmonton was granted a WHA franchise, the Edmonton Oilers. Matheson became the beat writer for the Oilers then, and continued when the Oilers joined the NHL in 1979. He spent countless hours covering the team and its five Stanley Cups, and completed more than 300 stories per winter. In addition to writing, Matheson also was a part of the CFRN radio broadcasting team that covered the Oilers. After 24 years, he completed his tenure as beat writer for the Oilers in 1997. He now continues to write for the Edmonton Journal covering the NHL and the Oilers. Passage 2:Colonel (promoted to Major General 4 June 1940) Mikhail Shumilov took command in April 1938. In September 1939, the corps fought in the Soviet invasion of Poland as part of the 10th Army. It included the 6th, 33rd, and the 121st Rifle Divisions at the beginning of the invasion on 17 September. By 2 October, these divisions had transferred to other units, and it included the 29th, 64th, and 145th Rifle Divisions instead. The corps headquarters relocated to Grodno in November and became part of the 11th Army. Between June and July 1940 it was briefly headquartered at Kovno before moving to Šiauliai in August, part of the Baltic Special Military District. The 11th transferred to the 8th Army in October, and included the 11th and 125th Rifle Divisions by the outbreak of the war. It defended a 40-kilometer sector on the left flank of the 8th Army, with its headquarters in the forests northwest of Skaudvilė. The 125th Rifle Division was in the corps' first echelon, holding covering the highway and railroad from Tilsit to Šiauliai. The 48th Rifle Division (part of the adjacent 10th Rifle Corps), after moving forward from Riga, was to take up positions on the left of the 125th. The corps' 73rd Corps Artillery Regiment included four battalions of 107 mm guns. Passage 3:Hardstone carving falls under the general category of glyptic art, which covers small carvings and sculpture in all categories of stone. The definition in this context of \\"hardstone\\" is unscientific and not very rigid, but excludes \\"soft\\" stones such as soapstone (steatite) and minerals such as alabaster, both widely used for carving, as well as typical stones for building and monumental sculpture, such as marble and other types of limestone, and sandstone. These are typically not capable of a fine finish in very small carvings, and would wear in prolonged use. In other contexts, such as architecture, \\"hard stone\\" and \\"soft stone\\" have different meanings, referring to actual measured hardness using the Mohs scale of mineral hardness and other measures. Some rocks used in architecture and monumental sculpture, such as granite, are at least as hard as the gemstones, and others such as malachite are relatively soft but counted as hardstones because of their rarity and fine colour.","response":"To find the answer to the question \\"How old was Jack Matheson when Jim was born?\\", I will first look for any relevant information in the given passages. Passage 1 provides information about Jack Matheson's life and career. However, there is no mention of Jim or Jack's age when Jim was born. Passage 2 discusses military events and personnel, and does not mention Jack Matheson or Jim at all. Passage 3 is about hardstone carving and does not mention either Jack Matheson or Jim.

Introduction: As an AI assistant, my duty is to provide an objective and well-reasoned negative review of a fictitious movie titled \\"Ocean's Flop.\\" I aim to point out the areas where the film falls short, while refraining from exaggerating its flaws or stooping to personal attacks. 2. Clumsy plot: The plot of \\"Ocean's Flop\\" is an ambitious attempt at an underwater heist movie. However, the story becomes muddled in its own complexity. Viewers are left struggling to understand the motivations and goals of the characters, while at the same time trying to decipher why certain implausible events are taking place. Step 2 justification: In this part, I explain the primary issue that affects the quality of the movie – its plot. Giving a clear idea of what makes the film disappointing will help readers understand the reviewer's point of view. 3. Lack of character development: One of the key ingredients to a compelling movie is well-developed and relatable characters. Unfortunately, \\"Ocean's Flop\\" fails in this aspect as well. Viewers are never given enough opportunity to connect with the film's characters, making it hard to invest in their struggles and triumphs. Step 3 justification: Describing the lack of character development allows the reader to understand that the film does not provide an engaging experience, making it unsatisfactory. 4. Poor pacing: The pacing of \\"Ocean's Flop\\" is another area where the film suffers. The sluggish start drags on too long, and the climax of the movie arrives too abruptly, leaving viewers with a sense of unfulfillment. A consistent and well-structured pacing could have saved the film from its weak plot, but regrettably, that too falls short of expectations. Step 4 justification: Highlighting the pacing issue emphasizes that the movie fails to maintain the audience's interest from beginning to end. 5. Unconvincing special effects: Considering this is an underwater heist movie, one would expect a visual treat with awe-inspiring special effects. Unfortunately, \\"Ocean's Flop\\" disappoints in this area too, with unconvincing CGI work that detracts from the supposed excitement of the underwater realm. Step 5 justification: Pointing out the disappointing special effects is important because this is a critical aspect that the target audience would likely be expecting the movie to excel at. 6. Conclusion: In conclusion, \\"Ocean's Flop\\" fails to deliver an engaging and satisfying experience to moviegoers. Its weak plot, lack of character development, poor pacing, and unconvincing special effects make it hard to recommend to even the most diehard of underwater action fans. While the concept of an underwater heist movie is intriguing, \\"Ocean's Flop\\" unfortunately sinks, rather than swims.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Charger can be used to listen to music.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Headphones can be used to listen to music.\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"Step 1: Define the meaning of nonsensical. Nonsensical: something that lacks any clear meaning, or something that is illogical or absurd. Step 2: Analyze Sentence A - \\"Charger can be used to listen to music.\\" Chargers are primarily used to provide power or charge electronic devices. Listening to music is not the primary function of a charger.

They are created to convert electrical signals into sound waves that the user can hear. This sentence conveys a clear and logical meaning. It is not nonsensical.

Prior to his transfer to USP Florence ADMAX, McVeigh was held at various prisons, including the El Reno Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma and the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth in Kansas. The Oklahoma City bombing, which took place on April 19, 1995, was a domestic terrorist attack in which McVeigh and his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, loaded a rental truck with explosives and detonated it outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, resulting in the death of 168 people and injuries to over 680 more. It remains one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in U.S. history. McVeigh was arrested, tried, and convicted on federal charges, including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, the use of a weapon of mass destruction, and eight counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of federal law enforcement officers who were within the building at the time of the attack. After a lengthy trial, McVeigh was sentenced to death and was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Indiana.

To begin with, the app was riddled with glitches and bugs that made it nearly impossible to use. The interface is highly unappealing and disorganized, making it extremely difficult to navigate through the various features. The app also consumes an excessive amount of my phone's battery life, causing it to drain at an alarming rate, even when I'm not actively using the app. Moreover, it constantly crashes and freezes during use, which is beyond frustrating. This unreliability has severely impacted my day-to-day tasks, and I often find myself searching for alternative apps to fulfill my needs. Furthermore, the app's permissions seem invasive, and I am uncomfortable with the amount of personal data it requests access to. Coupled with the numerous performance issues, this raises serious concerns for me in terms of privacy and security. Lastly, customer support is virtually nonexistent. Whenever I attempt to report any of the aforementioned issues, I receive generic responses that offer no real solutions or assistance.

The series was held from June 7 to June 14, 1995, and featured a best-of-seven format. The Magic, led by their young center Shaquille O'Neal and guard Anfernee \\"Penny\\" Hardaway, reached the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history. The Houston Rockets were the defending NBA champions, having won the title in 1994, and they were led by their star center Hakeem Olajuwon. The series started with Games 1 and 2 in Orlando at the then-named Orlando Arena. Although the Magic were the top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference and had home-court advantage, they lost both games at home. Game 1 was particularly memorable as it went into overtime, with the Rockets winning by a score of 120-118. Some key moments for the Rockets in this game included guard Kenny Smith hitting a game-tying three-pointer to send it to overtime and Hakeem Olajuwon tipping in a missed shot by teammate Clyde Drexler to clinch the win. The Magic continued to struggle in the series as it shifted to Houston for Games 3, 4, and 5 at the Summit. The Rockets won all three games on their home court to complete a 4-0 sweep of the series, sealing their second consecutive NBA championship and denying the Orlando Magic their first NBA title. Hakeem Olajuwon was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year, as he averaged 32.8 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game during the series. His stellar performance, along with key contributions from his teammates, proved to be too much for the young Orlando Magic squad to handle. In summary, the Orlando Magic lost to the Houston Rockets in the 1995 NBA Finals. The Rockets were a potent, experienced team that successfully defended their NBA championship title, sweeping the Magic in four straight games and preventing them from securing their first-ever championship."},{"question":"Finally a new Tweet.

This task involves a series of steps and the understanding of several physical objects, as well as their functions and properties. Here's a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Materials and tools: To begin with, you need to have a clear understanding of the various physical objects that will be required. This includes wood (for the table), screws or nails (to hold the pieces together), wood glue (for reinforcement), and tools such as a saw (to cut the wood), a measuring tape (for accurate measurements), a pencil (to mark points), a hammer or screwdriver (to secure screws or nails), sandpaper (to smoothen the surfaces), a drill (to create holes), and a level (to ensure the table is balanced). 2. Design and planning: Before starting the construction, you need to determine the dimensions, shape, and style of the table you wish to build. This is where knowledge of physical properties of objects comes into play – you must be aware of the structural integrity of the materials you are working with and how they can be joined together. The design should factor in the purpose of the table, the load it is expected to bear, and the available space where it will be placed. 3. Cutting and measuring: Next, you will have to measure and cut the pieces of wood according to the design, making sure that they fit together properly. This step requires precision and knowledge of the physical dimensions of the materials. 4. Assembly: Start assembling the pieces together by attaching the legs of the table to the tabletop. Use your understanding of the physical objects (wood, screws, or nails) to ensure that the connections are strong and secure. Utilize the wood glue alongside screws or nails to provide additional strength to the joints. Attach any additional components, such as crossbars or support beams, to enhance the stability of the table. 5. Finishing touches: Once the table has been assembled, use sandpaper to smoothen the surfaces and edges, eliminating any rough spots or splinters. This will provide a better appearance and ensure that people using the table won't hurt themselves on any sharp edges. 6. Staining and sealing: Depending on the desired aesthetic, choose a wood stain or paint to finish the table. Apply the stain or paint evenly on the table, ensuring that every surface is covered. Once it has dried, apply a varnish or sealant to protect the wood from moisture, scratches, and other damage. 7. Final inspection: Finally, examine the table to ensure that it is stable, flat, and free of defects. Use the level to confirm that the table is balanced, make any necessary adjustments, and verify that all joints are secure and the surface is smooth. Throughout this entire process, knowledge of physical objects is essential for selecting the appropriate materials, understanding their properties, and using them efficiently to perform the task of creating a wooden table."},{"question":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: biological species is the largest predatory fish in the sea and can grow to feet and live","response":"The most important words in the given sentence are \\"biological species,\\" \\"largest predatory fish,\\" \\"sea,\\" \\"grow,\\" \\"feet,\\" and \\"live.\\" 1. \\"Biological species\\": This phrase is essential because it establishes the overall context of the statement by specifying that the subject is a living organism from a specific species. 2. \\"Largest predatory fish\\": The term \\"largest predatory fish\\" is crucial since it informs us about the unique characteristics of the subject.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 . - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

Output:","response":"Explanation: The task requires you to identify whether the object in the sentence is singular or plural. Guidelines: The main clause of the sentence is 'Everyone held their breaths as a horde of men charged into the room'. The object of a sentence is the person, thing, or place that is receiving the action of the verb. In this case, the action is 'charged' and the object of the action is 'a horde of men'. To decide if the object is singular or plural, we need to check the noun 'a horde of men'. When we have a phrase like 'a horde of...', whatever comes after 'of' will determine if the overall phrase is singular or plural. Here 'men' is plural. Therefore, the phrase 'a horde of men' is seen as plural because of the word 'men'.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","response":"After analyzing the given task, it appears that you have not provided any specific methods to compare. However, I will suggest several effective methods to prevent your clothes from smelling like mildew in the closet. You can evaluate these methods based on your available resources and preferences before choosing the most reasonable method that suits your needs. 1. Proper ventilation and air circulation: Ensure that your closet has proper ventilation to allow air circulation. Open closet doors or install vents, as good air flow aids in evaporating moisture before it causes mildew growth. You can also use a small fan to promote air circulation. 2. Keep clothes clean and dry before storing: Washing and completely drying your clothes before storing them in the closet can significantly reduce the risk of mildew. Damp clothes can encourage mold and mildew growth, so make sure that your clothes are completely dry before hanging or folding them into the closet. 3. Use a dehumidifier: A dehumidifier can help regulate the humidity levels in the area, thereby reducing the chances of mildew development. Portable and compact dehumidifiers are available in the market and can be placed near the closet to maintain optimal humidity. 4. Use moisture-absorbing products: There are various moisture-absorbing products available, such as silica gel packs or moisture absorber tubs, which can be placed inside the closet. These products help reduce excess moisture, thereby preventing mildew growth. 5. Regularly clean the closet: Periodically declutter and clean your closet to remove any mold spores or mildew. Wipe down the shelves, walls, and other surfaces with a vinegar-water solution (1 part white vinegar and 1 part water) or mild bleach solution. This can help prevent mildew build-up. 6. Use essential oils or natural odor absorbers: Certain essential oils, like tea tree oil and lavender oil, have natural antimicrobial properties that can help prevent mold and mildew growth. Additionally, you can place odor-absorbing materials like activated charcoal, baking soda, or coffee grounds in your closet to help neutralize any potential odors. 7. Avoid overcrowding: Do not overstuff your closet, as it can limit air circulation and trap moisture. Give your clothes enough room to breathe, which will help prevent mildew growth. 8. Periodically air out clothes: Take your clothes out of the closet occasionally and expose them to sunlight and fresh air. Sunlight and proper air circulation can help prevent mildew growth and eliminate any existing odors. In summary, several methods can help you keep your clothes from smelling like mildew. Some key factors to consider when selecting the most reasonable method include the effectiveness of the method, ease of implementation, cost, and your personal preferences. By combining multiple methods, you can effectively create an environment that inhibits the growth of mold and mildew, thus ensuring your clothes remain fresh and odor-free."},{"question":"kirjallinen. - (EN) Pidän päätöstä Guantanamon sulkemisesta myönteisenä, mutta olen kuitenkin huolestunut Euroopan maiden halukkuudesta ottaa vastaan entisiä vankeja, joilla saattaa edelleen olla yhteyksiä terroristeihin.

(If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"The shopping center located between Utrecht Centraal railway station and the city centre is Hoog Catharijne."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - Carignan (also known as Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Samsó, and Carignane) is a red Spanish/French wine grape variety that is widely planted throughout the western Mediterranean and around the globe. Along with Aramon, it was once considered one of the main grapes responsible for France's wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley. - A Bordeaux wine is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of France, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \\"claret\\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or \\"châteaux\\". There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine. - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 78 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive high-end wines sold internationally to more modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period. - Vitis (grapevines) is a genus of 79 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species predominantly from the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture. - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\". - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan , it can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour , but is mostly blended into bulk wines . The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine , and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine . Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines , it does carry their fruitful essence . The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California 's hot climate , specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys . Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural , special acidity . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Beqaa Valley (', ), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqâ and Becaa and known in Classical antiquity as Coele-Syria, is a fertile valley in eastern Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans). - The wine lake refers to the continuing supply surplus of wine produced in the European Union. A major contributor to that glut is the Languedoc-Roussillon, which produces over one-third of the grapes grown in France. In 2007 it was reported that for the previous several vintages, European countries had been producing 1.7 billion more bottles of wine than they sell. Hundreds of millions of bottles of wine are turned into industrial alcohol every year, a practice that is sometimes described as \\"emergency distillation\\". - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - \\"Jug wine\\" is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine (or \\"bulk wine\\") typically bottled in a glass jug. - Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name \\"Merlot\\" is thought to be a diminutive of \\"merle\\", the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and \\"fleshiness\\", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin. - Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is made into ice wine in those regions. What entity does 'ruby cabernet' has the relation 'instance of' with? Answer:","response":"Ruby Cabernet has the relation 'instance of' with the entity of grape variety. It is a specific red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan, designed to produce an inexpensive table wine with characteristics of both parent varieties."},{"question":"Začínám podávat protizánětlivé kortikoidy, hormony a antibiotické protokoly. Translate this to English?","response":"The sentence in English is \\"I am starting to administer anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, hormones, and antibiotic protocols.\\" This sentence generally relates to a medical regimen where the speaker is beginning to employ a variety of treatment methods, which includes anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, hormones, and antibiotics. 1. Anti-inflammatory corticosteroids refer to a class of drug that is commonly used to reduce inflammation in different parts of the body. They can be taken in various forms, such as tablets, injections, inhalers, creams, lotions, and eye drops. There are many different kinds of corticosteroids, some of which include prednisolone, betamethasone, and hydrocortisone, each with its own specific uses and side effects, therefore, it should be taken only under the guidance of a healthcare provider. 2. Hormones, on the other hand, are substances made by the body that control different body functions. Hormones are used in medicine for several reasons. For example, they can be used to strengthen chemical signals in the body or to introduce a new signal to control or stimulate certain body reactions. Medical use of hormones should also always be supervised by a healthcare provider as it may cause side effects. 3. Lastly, 'antibiotic protocols' is a bit more complex. This refers to a treatment plan involving antibiotics, which are drugs used to treat or prevent bacterial infections. Antibiotic protocols can vary widely depending on the type of bacteria being treated, the patient's health status, and the antibiotic being used. Implementing an antibiotic protocol means adhering to a specific plan for administering the antibiotic, carefully timing doses, and often involves monitoring the patient's response to the treatment. The sentence implies that the speaker, most probably a healthcare professional, has created a specified plan to treat a patient or control certain medical conditions by administrating anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, hormones, and antibiotics. It's important to remember that these treatments could have potential side effects and should only be administered under the supervision of a knowledgeable healthcare provider.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The paths of Elena Winters (Necar Zadegan), a mother and pastor's wife, and Peyton Lombard (Traci Dinwiddie), a well-known lesbian writer randomly cross. Instantly, they feel drawn toward one other and eventually fall in love. The movie opens in two places - following the two protagonists - first, within a church, where Elena's son, Nash, refuses to support an anti-homosexual protest, and then within a memorial service for Peyton's mother. Elena and her husband Barry (Gary Weeks) are trying to conceive but it becomes clear that their efforts have been unsuccessful when Barry rebukes Elena after her period starts. Peyton starts cleaning out her mother's things, having flashbacks of her emotionally troubled mother as she works. Peyton finds a tape entitled 'Women's Glory Project' with her things, and becomes obsessed with it for some time. Elena visits her friend Tyler for advice, telling him that she and Barry are going to adopt instead of trying to have another child. He asks \\"what's in it for (her),\\" and insists (as he's apparently done in the past) that Barry is not her soulmate, or \\"twin flame.\\" Even so, he pushes her to go to the adoption, saying that \\"someone is definitely coming into (her) life, in a big way.\\" Peyton and Elena meet at the adoption agency.

Is drunk sex rape?","response":"Although the two questions appear to be similar at first glance, they address different aspects of sexual consent and the implications of alcohol consumption. In this response, we will examine both questions in detail and highlight their distinctions. 1. If a woman is drunk and gives consent for sex, is that rape? This question focuses on the issue of consent in a specific context: when a woman is intoxicated but still verbally provides consent. The question recognizes that the woman is under the influence of alcohol, which might impair her judgment and decision-making abilities. In such cases, establishing valid consent can be challenging and may depend on various factors, including the level of intoxication and the ability to understand the nature of the act. Generally, consent should be informed, voluntary, and continuous. In some jurisdictions, a person who is heavily intoxicated might be considered legally incapable of giving consent. If a sexual act takes place in these circumstances, it could potentially be classified as rape, even if the person under the influence appeared to give their consent. However, different jurisdictions have different legal standards for determining what constitutes impairment and when consent is invalid. It is essential to be familiar with local laws and legislation to understand the legal implications in any specific case. 2. Is drunk sex rape? This question addresses the broader issue of intoxication and sex, without specifically regarding consent. It asks whether any sexual activity involving individuals who are intoxicated is automatically classified as rape. This particular phrasing does not differentiate between levels of intoxication or the presence of consent from either party. The notion of drunk sex encompasses various scenarios: one or both individuals may be intoxicated, they may have given consent before becoming intoxicated, or consent can be ambiguous due to alcohol's impact on communication. As a result, there is no straightforward answer to this question. To conclude, while both questions tackle the relationship between intoxication and consent, they approach the topic from different angles. The first question focuses on whether a drunk woman's consent during sexual activity is valid, whereas the second question inquires about the general relationship between alcohol consumption and consent in sexual encounters. It is crucial to understand the nuances of sexual consent, the implications of intoxication on consent, and local laws and legislations that might affect the classification of rape in such cases."},{"question":"Article: Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the Scientific Revolution, but individual theorists made important contributions.

The objective is to start a regular \\"Bible study\\" with any person who is not already a member, with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members. Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching. They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly \\"Field Service Report\\". Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed \\"irregular\\" and may be counseled by elders; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed \\"inactive\\".\\" Answer: A:","response":"Jehovah's Witnesses go house to house for several reasons: 1. Spreading their beliefs: The primary reason Jehovah's Witnesses go house to house is to share their faith and religious beliefs. They aim to reach as many people as possible, educating them about the teachings of Jehovah and the Bible. By going door to door, they can directly engage with individuals, answer questions, and provide resources to help people understand their beliefs. 2. Fulfilling a biblical command: Jehovah's Witnesses believe that they are following Jesus' command to his disciples, as mentioned in Matthew 28:19-20 and Acts 1:8. They view public preaching and spreading the word of God as a vital part of their mission and religious duties. 3. Establishing Bible studies: Another goal of their house-to-house ministry is to initiate regular Bible studies with people who are not already members of their faith. They hope that through studying the Bible together, these individuals will develop a deeper understanding of Jehovah's teachings and eventually choose to become baptized members of the Jehovah's Witnesses community. 4. Maintaining an active ministry: Jehovah's Witnesses are expected to devote as much time as possible to their ministry. Each member must submit a monthly \\"Field Service Report,\\" documenting their efforts in spreading the word of God. This report allows the organization to track the progress of individual members and ensure that they remain active and engaged in their missionary work. 5. Providing support and encouragement: By visiting people in their homes, Jehovah's Witnesses can offer a personal connection and support to those who are interested in their faith. They can address specific concerns, provide guidance, and help people navigate their spiritual journey. In summary, Jehovah's Witnesses go house to house as a way to spread their beliefs, fulfill a biblical command, establish Bible studies, maintain an active ministry, and provide support and encouragement to those they encounter. This approach allows them to engage with a wide range of people and reinforce their commitment to sharing their faith."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Question: Why did IMB hire so many designers? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","response":"IBM hired so many designers as a part of their design thinking revolution, led by Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design. The goal of this initiative was to transform the company and adapt to the rapidly changing business environment by incorporating design thinking principles into its core business practices. There were several key reasons behind hiring such a large number of designers: 1. Infusing design thinking into the organization: IBM wanted to ensure that design thinking became an integral part of the company's culture. By bringing in designers from diverse backgrounds, they aimed to foster a creative, user-centered mindset among the workforce. 2. Enhancing product and service development: Designers play a crucial role in shaping products and services that cater to the needs of users. Having a large pool of designers allowed IBM to work on multiple projects simultaneously, ensuring that each product or service met user requirements and provided superior experience. 3. Accelerating innovation: The presence of a large number of designers enabled IBM to generate new ideas quickly, iterate on them, and bring innovative solutions to the market faster. Designers have significantly contributed to the company's innovation pipeline. 4. Strengthening collaboration and cross-functional teams: Designers at IBM work closely with other departments like engineering, marketing, and sales, promoting a collaborative environment and more effective communication. This increased collaboration has been key to the development of innovative solutions that address complex business problems. 5. Staff training and upskilling: With over 1,000 designers on board, IBM provided design thinking training to over 8,000 of its managers and staff. Although this number represents a small portion of the entire workforce, it demonstrates IBM's commitment to invest in employee development and create a more design-driven organization.

Article: My name is Lin Hui. I like to tell stories about people who work together. What is even better is when countries help each other and build a good friendship. An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province. At the moment the Milu deer live in centres where they are being well protected and cared for.

Known as one of the Philadelphia Phillies' greatest pitchers, Roberts left an indelible mark on the sport as he led the Whiz Kids, a group of young and talented players, to win the 1950 National League Pennant. This incredible achievement set the stage for a golden era in the Phillies' history, and Roberts' inspiring leadership is still remembered fondly by fans and colleagues alike. Early Life and Career: Born Robin Evan Roberts on September 30, 1926, in Springfield, Illinois, he spent his early years honing his skills in both basketball and baseball as a multi-sport athlete. Following a short stint at Michigan State University, Roberts was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1948 and made his Major League debut the following year. His impressive fastball and tireless work ethic quickly established him as the team's ace pitcher. During the 1950 MLB season, Roberts helped secure the Phillies' first National League Pennant in 35 years, earning the nickname of \\"Whiz Kids.\\" This success was not only a testament to Roberts' exceptional skill but also his innate leadership qualities, which won him the admiration and respect of his teammates. Leading the Whiz Kids: The 1950 Phillies' team predominantly consisted of young, inexperienced players, collectively known as the Whiz Kids. Their average age was just 26, and they seemed unlikely to win a championship. However, Robin Roberts' unwavering commitment to excellence propelled the team forward. As the team's star pitcher, Roberts had an incredible season in 1950. He secured 20 wins, a feat he would achieve in six consecutive seasons. His exceptional performances on the mound and leadership off the field enabled the Whiz Kids to defy the odds and clinch the National League Pennant in a tense, winner-take-all game against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Roberts' Resilience and Rewards: Robin Roberts' claim to fame did not come without challenges. In 1950, he suffered a near-fatal accident when a line drive fractured his skull. Incredibly, after just three weeks of recovery, he returned to pitch and played an instrumental role in winning the pennant. Throughout his career, Roberts was consistently recognized for his achievements on the field. He was selected to seven All-Star games, becoming the first National League pitcher to start five of the games. In 1962, Roberts became the first Phillies' pitcher to receive an honorary plaque in the team's Wall of Fame, a testament to his lasting legacy in the hearts of Philadelphia baseball fans. Later Years and Legacy: Roberts played a total of 19 seasons in Major League Baseball, with stints on the Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, and Chicago Cubs. He retired from professional baseball in 1966 with 286 career wins, a total of 45 shutouts, and an astonishing 2,357 strikeouts under his belt. In retirement, Roberts turned his attention to coaching and administration. He served as a front-office executive for various teams, including the Reading Phillies, and coached at the University of South Florida. His profound knowledge of the game allowed him to cultivate future generations of baseball players. Robin Roberts’ life was a testament to the enduring power of hard work, dedication, and determination. He led a group of young, inexperienced players to achieve baseball greatness, establishing a lasting legacy that remains woven into the fabric of Philadelphia Phillies' history. His story is a reminder that with passion and perseverance, seemingly insurmountable odds can be overcome, and true success can be achieved."},{"question":"Here is some data: Fitzbillies eatType coffee shop; Fitzbillies food Indian; Fitzbillies priceRange cheap; Fitzbillies customer rating 5 out of 5; Fitzbillies area riverside; Fitzbillies familyFriendly yes.

There are several reasons for this which I will outline below. 1. Technical issues with the game: The reviewer mentioned that the game stops running at the end of the intro video and does not proceed further. This indicates a significant issue that prevents the game from being played. As a potential customer, I would be concerned about encountering the same problem, especially if other users experienced a similar issue. 2. Poor customer support: The reviewer also mentioned that they had difficulty returning the product due to an issue with the return process on the retailer's website. This suggests that the customer support may not be responsive or helpful, which could be problematic if I were to purchase the product and face issues later on. 3. Lack of clarity in the review: The review has a few grammatical errors and is not well-structured, making it challenging to understand the exact problem the reviewer encountered. However, the overall negative sentiment can still be discerned from the given information. This might cause me to question the legitimacy of the review, but it would not remove the concerns about the product itself. 4. Compatibility with gaming console: Despite the reviewer indicating that their PS3 is new and other games work without any issues, they faced problems with this particular game. This may indicate that the game itself has compatibility or performance issues with certain gaming consoles, which could make it less appealing for potential customers. In conclusion, the presence of technical issues with the game, poor customer support, and compatibility concerns would significantly reduce my interest in purchasing the product. Further research, such as looking for additional reviews or seeking feedback from friends or online forums, could provide additional insights and help me make a more informed decision about whether to buy the game or not."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a paragraph, a question and some answer options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", etc.) You need to list all the correct answer options with their associated letters (e.g. \\"A\\" can be a valid answer).

They both work out regularly for improved health. Mary has been experiencing some health issues lately. Which person has a stronger immune system? Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to.

The answer to this question is:","response":"immune system. The immune system is the body's natural defense mechanism against harmful particles, such as bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that can cause illness. The immune system plays a critical role in identifying and neutralizing these harmful agents to maintain overall health and well-being. While the initial answer choices mentioned various components of the human body, some of these options can be ruled out for not being directly related to the defense against harmful particles. For instance, the lungs, pancreas, and liver are organs that perform essential functions in the body but are not primarily focused on defending against harmful particles. An exoskeleton is not relevant to humans, as it is a feature found in some animal species for protection and support. Wearing a breathing mask can provide a physical barrier that helps prevent harmful particles from entering the respiratory system. However, this external protection does not constitute a part of the body's internal defense system. Once harmful particles enter the body, it is the immune system's responsibility to recognize and combat these invaders. The immune system is composed of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body. Some key components of the immune system include white blood cells, such as phagocytes and lymphocytes, which have specialized functions for attacking and neutralizing harmful invaders. The body also produces defensive proteins called antibodies that can recognize and neutralize specific pathogens. Additionally, organs such as the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes play vital roles in producing and distributing immune system components. Therefore, when considering the body's internal defense against harmful particles, the immune system is the best answer choice."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Their teachers were asked to record their behavior. After five nights of the records, scientists found that those who slept one hour less behaved worse than those who slept one hour more. Students with less sleep were more likely to feel sad and had more problems paying attention. The scientists chose to study children in their homes instead of in a laboratory, because they wanted to find out how everyday changes might affect children's behavior at school. \\"In the study, nobody became a talent, and nobody became crazy.

White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.

Kitchener served as the commander-in-chief of the Anglo-Egyptian forces during the Sudan Campaign, which took place between 1896 and 1898. The \\"scorched earth policy\\" implemented by Kitchener involved the destruction of infrastructure, resources, and civilian property to weaken the enemy and deny them supplies and support from the local population. Kitchener employed this approach in the Sudan to diminish the Mahdist forces' ability to resist the Anglo-Egyptian forces effectively. Kitchener's campaign in Sudan saw a series of successful military engagements, such as the Battle of Atbara in April 1898 and the decisive Battle of Omdurman in September 1898. This final battle, in particular, marked a turning point in the campaign, as Kitchener's forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Mahdist army, ultimately securing the Sudan region under British control and establishing Anglo-Egyptian condominium (joint governance) over the territory. In recognition of his successes in the Sudan, Kitchener was later promoted to the rank of full General and continued his military career, serving in prominent roles during the early 20th century, including the First World War."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto.

Notice in particular the curves for NH4NO3 and CaCl2. The dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic (ΔHsoln = +25.7 kJ/mol), whereas the dissolution of calcium chloride is exothermic (ΔHsoln = −68.2 kJ/mol), yet Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\" shows that the solubility of both compounds increases sharply with increasing temperature. In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature. The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books. Chemists are often able to use this information to separate the components of a mixture byfractional crystallization, the separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent. For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH3CO2Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80°C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0°C. According to the temperature curves in Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\", both compounds dissolve in water at 80°C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0°C.

Decide what your vineyard will be for. Study your local climate. Select a grape variety. Consider grafted vines. Choose the area where you will be planting. Test the soil. Article:","response":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Growing Grapes: From Selection to Harvest Introduction Growing grapes can be an enjoyable and rewarding endeavor, whether you're looking to start your own vineyard or simply cultivate grapes for personal use. However, to ensure the best possible outcome, it is essential to understand the ins and outs of grape cultivation. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to grow grapes, from selecting the appropriate grape variety to testing the soil before planting. Step 1: Establishing the Purpose of Your Vineyard The first step in growing grapes is determining the purpose of your vineyard. Are you looking to produce wine, raisins, or fresh table grapes? The end goal will determine which grape varieties to consider, as well as the cultivation techniques, grapevine maintenance, and harvesting practices. Step 2: Studying Your Local Climate Before you can begin growing grapes, it is vital to understand your local climate, as grapes are sensitive to temperature variations and rainfall levels. Consult local agricultural agencies or extension offices for information on the ideal growing conditions for different grape varieties in your region. This will provide a solid foundation for your decision-making process when choosing a grape variety. Step 3: Selecting a Grape Variety Once you have determined the purpose of your vineyard and studied your local climate, it is time to select a grape variety. Grape varieties are classified into three categories: table grape varieties, which are most commonly consumed fresh; wine grape varieties, which are specifically cultivated for wine production; and raisin grape varieties, intended for drying. Selecting a grape variety that aligns with the purpose of your vineyard and your local climate is essential for the success of your grape-growing endeavor. Step 4: Considering Grafted Vines Grafted vines are created by attaching a desired grape variety to a rootstock, which is a separate plant chosen for its root system compatibility and ability to combat soil-borne pests and diseases. Grafted vines can be an excellent choice for beginners or those looking to expedite their grape production process, as they generally have shorter establishment times and require less pruning. Consult with local vineyard experts to determine if grafted vines are an ideal option for your location and desired grape variety. Step 5: Choosing the Planting Area Selecting the right area to plant your grapevines is of utmost importance. Grapes require ample sunlight and well-drained, fertile soil. In addition, the planting area should have a slight slope to prevent soil erosion and promote air circulation. Make sure to choose an area that provides adequate space for your desired vine density, as overcrowding can lead to disease and poor grape production. Step 6: Testing the Soil The final step before planting your grapevines is testing the soil to ensure it is suitable for grape cultivation. Grapes prefer soil with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5, and soil testing can reveal potential deficiencies or issues that may need to be addressed prior to planting. Consult with local agricultural agencies or extension offices for information on soil testing laboratories and services in your area. Conclusion Grape cultivation can be a highly rewarding experience, providing both a sense of personal accomplishment and, in time, a bountiful harvest. By following these steps and critically assessing each aspect of the grape-growing process, you will be well on your way to establishing a thriving vineyard that can be enjoyed for generations to come."},{"question":"Q: Because several genes, each with more than one allele, contribute to determining height in humans, height is considered what kind of trait?

While in Europe in 1967, Wright abandoned his plans to become a doctor and instead toured locally with a band he had formed, the New York Times. When the latter supported the English group Traffic - at Oslo in Norway, according to Wright - he met Island Records founder Chris Blackwell. Wright recalls that he and Blackwell had a mutual friend in Jimmy Miller, the New York-born producer of Island acts such as the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic. Blackwell invited Wright to London, where he joined English singer and pianist Mike Harrison and drummer Mike Kellie in their band Art (formerly the VIPs). The group soon changed its name to Spooky Tooth, with Wright as joint lead vocalist and Hammond organ player. While noting the band's lack of significant commercial success over its career, The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll describes Spooky Tooth as \\"a bastion of Britain's hard-rock scene\\". Spooky Tooth's first album was It's All About, released on Island in June 1968. Produced by Miller, it contained the Wright-composed \\"Sunshine Help Me\\" and six songs he co-wrote with either Miller, Harrison or Luther Grosvenor, the band's guitarist. Spooky Two, often considered the band's best work, followed in March 1969, with Miller again producing. Wright composed or co-composed seven of the album's eight songs, including \\"That Was Only Yesterday\\" and \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\". Spooky Two sold well in America but, like It's All About, it failed to place on the UK's top 40 albums chart. The third Spooky Tooth album was Ceremony, a Wright-instigated collaboration with French electronic music pioneer Pierre Henry, released in December 1969. Songwriting for all the tracks was credited to Henry and Wright, after the latter had passed the band's recordings on to Henry for what The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia terms \\"processed musique concrete overdubs\\". Although Wright had traditionally provided an experimental influence within Spooky Tooth, he regretted the change of musical direction, saying in a 1973 interview: \\"We should have really taken off after Spooky Two but we got into the absurd situation of letting Pierre Henry make the Ceremony album. Then he took it back to France and remixed it.\\" With bass player Greg Ridley having already left the band in 1969 to join Humble Pie, Wright departed in January 1970 to pursue a solo career.

His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America. When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of 9,000 (equal to 147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's Encyclopedia in 1820; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales.

[...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\\" Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based. Historically, controversy over the Quran's content has rarely become an issue, although debates continue on the subject.\\"?

Generally, a term of parliament measures the time taken from the initial seating of a parliamentary assembly after an election to the point when the assembly is dissolved, paving the way for new elections. In this article, we will delve into the history of parliamentary systems to examine the record length of the longest term parliament and the unique circumstances that contributed to this unusually prolonged duration. The Longest Term Length of Parliament The record for the longest term length of a parliament in history goes to the English Parliament during the Stuart era, under the reign of King Charles I. This parliamentary term, which later came to be known as the \\"Long Parliament,\\" lasted for an astounding 20 years, from November 3, 1640, until April 20, 1660. Historical Context The Long Parliament's lengthy tenure can be traced back to the complex political, religious, and social factors prevalent in 17th-century England. It was a time marked by tensions between the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the emerging bourgeoisie, as well as the struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism that permeated European society. King Charles I ascended the English throne in 1625 and immediately attempted to rule without the need for Parliament. This deeply unpopular move led to several conflicts, including the Bishops' Wars (1639-1640), which ultimately forced the King to recall Parliament in 1640. However, the newly-elected Parliament, consisting mostly of Puritans and Calvinists, would go on to challenge Charles' authority and resist his autocratic tendencies. Main Events during the Long Parliament 1. Reform Agenda: The Long Parliament immediately embarked upon a reform agenda, seeking to curtail the power of the monarchy. The Parliament successfully abolished the widely despised Court of Star Chamber and the Court of High Commission. Additionally, Charles I was compelled to dissolve the Council of Wales and the North, further consolidating parliamentary authority. 2. Grand Remonstrance: Dissatisfied with Charles I's continued interference in religious and political matters, Parliament drafted the Grand Remonstrance, a comprehensive list of grievances against the King's policies. The conflict boiled over when Charles tried to arrest five members of Parliament in 1642, marking the beginning of the English Civil War. 3. English Civil War: This brutal conflict spanned from 1642 to 1649, with the war fought between Parliamentary forces led by Oliver Cromwell and the Royalist supporters of King Charles I. The battles culminated in a victory for the Parliamentary forces, and Charles was ultimately executed in 1649. 4. The Interregnum and the Commonwealth: After the execution of Charles I, England experimented briefly with the establishment of a republic, known as the Commonwealth of England, with Cromwell as its Lord Protector. In the years that followed, the Long Parliament would establish its own interim administration and continued exercising its legislative and executive power. 5. The Restoration: With Cromwell's death in 1658 and the subsequent collapse of the Protectorate, the political landscape changed drastically. The return of the monarchy became imminent, and in 1660, General George Monck facilitated the restoration of the Stuart monarchy under Charles II. This marked the end of the Long Parliament and the beginning of the Convention Parliament, thereby concluding the two-decade-long parliamentary term. Conclusion The record-breaking 20-year term length of the Long Parliament not only stands as an unusual historical anomaly but also serves as a testament to the dramatic and tumultuous era it was a part of. The sheer longevity of this Parliament was marked by Civil War, the rise and fall of the Commonwealth, and the Restoration of the Monarchy. The Long Parliament was instrumental in shaping England's political trajectory, with its legacy effusing social, political, and religious facets of British history."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Bottom line, this product does not work as advertised.I took my dog (treated with Advantix - advertised tick protection), and my mom's dog (control - no tick protection) into the hills for a hike. Both dogs were kept mostly on the trail, both dogs did brush against the grass. After the hike, my mom's dog with no tick repellent picked up 7 ticks.

The advantix may work a little... both my husband and I found ticks crawling toward our heads after sitting on the couch with the dog.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Through a lap-dissolve, d'Artagnan becomes the modern Kansan Ned Thacker, who was born during a tornado and whose mother read him swashbuckling novels while in the womb. After several episodes where Ned gets into trouble trying to defend women (and a cute cameo by Zasu Pitts), we meet Marjorie Daw, whose mother wants her to marry the rich sleazeball Forrest Vandeteer. They run into trouble on a cross-country automobile trip, and are rescued by Fairbanks when he converts his Ford into a railcar to cross a desert washout. At the El Tovar hotel, we meet the villainous Navajo Chin-de-dah, who lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, who leads Forrest and Marjorie to his lair with \\"forced marriage\\" on his mind. With the assistance of one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Ned Thacker descends the cliffs on a rope and effects a rescue. While the villain is a very unfortunate Indian stereotype, the footage of the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly is spectacular, and taken in the spirit it was intended, this is a fun, somewhat carelessly constructed romp, and a good example of why Douglas Fairbanks was so popular. In the surviving material shown at the Buster Keaton Festival, some confusion is caused when Forrest Vandeteer's name changes to Forrest Barris part way through, probably because of a difference in the source material. Answer:","response":"One of Chin-de-dah's henchmen helps Ned Thacker."},{"question":"In this task, you are given two simple actions (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\").

Article: Are we getting more stupid? According to Gerald Crabtree, a scientist at Stanford University in the US, we are. You may not want to hear this, but Crabtree believes that human intelligence reached its peak more than 2,000 years ago and ever since then has been going downhill. \\"If an average Greek from 1,000 BC were transported to modern times, he or she would be one of the brightest among us,\\" Crabtree told The Guardian. At the heart of Crabtree's thinking is a simple idea. In the past, intelligence was critical for survival when our ancestors had to avoid dangerous animals and hunt for food. The difference of being smart or stupid is often life or death. However, after the spread of agriculture, when our ancestors began to live in dense farming communities, the need to keep their intelligence in peak condition gradually reduced. This is not hard to understand. Most of the time, pressure is what keeps us going - you need the pressure from your teachers to finish your homework; the pressure of looking pretty prompts you to lose weight when summer comes. And the same is also true of our intelligence - if we think less, we become less smart. These mutations are harmful to our intelligence and they were all developed in the past 3,000 years. The other evidence that Crabtree holds is in our genes. He found that among the 2,000 to 5,000 genes that we have that determine human intelligence , there are two or more mutations in each of us. However, Crabtree's theory has been criticized by some who say that early humans may have better hunting and surviving abilities, but people today have developed a more diverse intelligence. For example, spearing a tiger doesn't necessarily require more brainpower than playing chess or writing a poem. Moreover, the power of modern education means a lot more people have the opportunity to learn nowadays. \\"You wouldn't get Stephen Hawking 2,000 years ago. He just wouldn't exist,\\" Thomas Hills of the University of Warwick, UK, told Live Science. \\"But now we have people of his... Question: What is Thomas Hills' attitude toward Crabtree's theory?

However, upon researching further, it predominantly falls under the categories of written work and film. Let me provide you with the necessary information for both of these aspects. 1. Written work: \\"Solomon's Stone\\" has been used as a title and concept within written works in the past. Primarily, it can refer to the legendary substance known as the \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" or \\"Stone of Solomon.\\" This substance was highly sought after by alchemists during the Middle Ages and was believed to possess the power to transmute base metals into gold and silver, as well as grant eternal life. The Philosopher's Stone is also known as \\"Lapis Philosophorum\\" and has been mentioned in various literary works, ranging from historic texts on alchemy to contemporary fiction works such as the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. 2. Film: \\"Solomon's Stone\\" is also the title of a 2002 Bulgarian short film directed by Maya Vitkova. This film tells the fictional story of a mysterious stone falling from the sky and possessing incredible powers, which creates turmoil and unexpected twists in the lives of those who come into contact with it. The film was well-received at international film festivals and represents a creative take on the ancient legend of the Philosopher's Stone.

I want to commit suicide. Is there any way to make it look like a natural death? Is there life after death?","response":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning, and it is essential to address them distinctly and responsibly. As an AI language model, I must clarify that I cannot provide assistance for actions that could harm yourself or others, such as planning or encouraging suicide. Suicide is a serious and alarming issue affecting countless individuals, and if you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, please seek help immediately. There are numerous support systems available to help, such as friends, family, and mental health professionals. In the United States, you can contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or use a local helpline in your own country. Remember, reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. The second question, \\"Is there life after death?\\", pertains to the philosophical, religious, and existential beliefs about what happens to individuals after they die. This question has been pondered and debated throughout human history, and the answer varies depending on one's cultural, religious, and spiritual background. There is no universally accepted answer as several different perspectives try to explain this question. Here are a few prominent viewpoints: 1. Religious perspectives: Many religious beliefs propose the idea of life after death. For instance, Christianity teaches about the resurrection, where believers will rise from the dead and have eternal life. In Buddhism and Hinduism, the concept of reincarnation suggests that a person's soul will be reborn into a new body after death. Meanwhile, Islam mentions an afterlife in paradise or hell, depending on one's actions in this life. 2. Spiritual perspectives: Some individuals believe in an afterlife where one's consciousness (or soul) continues to exist in a non-physical realm. This idea entails the possibility of connecting with deceased loved ones, spirit guides, and the source of energy or consciousness. There is no definitive evidence for this perspective, but it remains popular among many who hold spiritual beliefs. 3. Materialist or atheist perspectives: From a materialist standpoint, there is no evidence of life after death. Many adherents to this viewpoint argue that consciousness arises from brain function, and when an individual dies, the brain ceases to function, which means that consciousness and existence come to an end. This perspective focuses on the importance of living a meaningful and fulfilling life now, as death signifies the end of our consciousness and existence. While the first question revolves around harmful and life-threatening actions, the second is an inquiry into philosophical, religious, and existential beliefs. It's crucial to address these in separate contexts, and in case of any distress or suicidal thoughts, it is essential to seek professional help and support immediately."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in Spanish and your task is to translate it into English.

More than 62,000 incidents, including torture and rape, have been filed to the commission since 2013. Tunisia became a democracy after President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011. The commission is investigating reports of police torture, corruption and murder over a 50-year-period since independence. Alleged abusers include Tunisia's previous state authorities and top security bosses. A quarter of alleged victims are women who have complained about sexual violence, formerly a taboo in Tunisia. The mother of a protester shot by security forces in 2011, Ourida Kadoussi, began the televised testimonies. \\"They killed our children. We have not been given our rights,\\" she said asking for freedom and dignity. The president of the Truth and Dignity Commission, Sihem Ben Sedrine, opened the forum saying: \\"Tunisia will not accept human rights abuses after today. This is the message from Tunisia.\\" London-based human rights charity Amnesty International has welcomed the hearings, saying victims \\"may finally have a chance to have their right to truth fulfilled\\".

The Runaway General: The Rolling Stone Profile of Stanley McChrystal That Changed History The orders came from the command of Lt. Gen. William Caldwell, a three-star general in charge of training Afghan troops – the linchpin of U.S. strategy in the war. Over a four-month period last year, a military cell devoted to what is known as \\"information operations\\" at Camp Eggers in Kabul was repeatedly pressured to target visiting senators and other VIPs who met with Caldwell. When the unit resisted the order, arguing that it violated U.S. laws prohibiting the use of propaganda against American citizens, it was subjected to a campaign of retaliation. \\"My job in psy-ops is to play with people’s heads, to get the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave,\\" says Lt. Colonel Michael Holmes, the leader of the IO unit, who received an official reprimand after bucking orders. \\"I’m prohibited from doing that to our own people. When you ask me to try to use these skills on senators and congressman, you’re crossing a line.\\" Photos: Psy-Ops and the General The list of targeted visitors was long, according to interviews with members of the IO team and internal documents obtained by Rolling Stone. Those singled out in the campaign included senators John McCain, Joe Lieberman, Jack Reed, Al Franken and Carl Levin; Rep. Steve Israel of the House Appropriations Committee; Adm. Mike Mullen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Czech ambassador to Afghanistan; the German interior minister, and a host of influential think-tank analysts. The incident offers an indication of just how desperate the U.S. command in Afghanistan is to spin American civilian leaders into supporting an increasingly unpopular war. According to the Defense Department’s own definition, psy-ops – the use of propaganda and psychological tactics to influence emotions and behaviors – are supposed to be used exclusively on \\"hostile foreign groups.\\" Federal law forbids the military from practicing psy-ops on Americans, and each defense authorization bill comes with a \\"propaganda rider\\" that also prohibits such manipulation. \\"Everyone in the psy-ops, intel, and IO community knows you’re not supposed to target Americans,\\" says a veteran member of another psy-ops team who has run operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"It’s what you learn on day one.\\" The Kill Team: How U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan murdered innocent civilians and mutilated their corpses – and how their officers failed to stop them. Plus: an exclusive look at the war crime photos censored by the Pentagon When Holmes and his four-man team arrived in Afghanistan in November 2009, their mission was to assess the effects of U.S. propaganda on the Taliban and the local Afghan population. But the following month, Holmes began receiving orders from Caldwell’s staff to direct his expertise on a new target: visiting Americans. At first, the orders were administered verbally. According to Holmes, who attended at least a dozen meetings with Caldwell to discuss the operation, the general wanted the IO unit to do the kind of seemingly innocuous work usually delegated to the two dozen members of his public affairs staff: compiling detailed profiles of the VIPs, including their voting records, their likes and dislikes, and their \\"hot-button issues.\\" In one email to Holmes, Caldwell’s staff also wanted to know how to shape the general’s presentations to the visiting dignitaries, and how best to \\"refine our messaging.\\" King David's War: How Gen. Petraeus Is Doubling Down on a Failed Strategy Congressional delegations – known in military jargon as CODELs – are no strangers to spin. U.S. lawmakers routinely take trips to the frontlines in Iraq and Afghanistan, where they receive carefully orchestrated briefings and visit local markets before posing for souvenir photos in helmets and flak jackets. Informally, the trips are a way for generals to lobby congressmen and provide first-hand updates on the war. But what Caldwell was looking for was more than the usual background briefings on senators. According to Holmes, the general wanted the IO team to provide a \\"deeper analysis of pressure points we could use to leverage the delegation for more funds.\\" The general’s chief of staff also asked Holmes how Caldwell could secretly manipulate the U.S. lawmakers without their knowledge. \\"How do we get these guys to give us more people?\\" he demanded. \\"What do I have to plant inside their heads?\\" According to experts on intelligence policy, asking a psy-ops team to direct its expertise against visiting dignitaries would be like the president asking the CIA to put together background dossiers on congressional opponents. Holmes was even expected to sit in on Caldwell’s meetings with the senators and take notes, without divulging his background. \\"Putting your propaganda people in a room with senators doesn’t look good,\\" says John Pike, a leading military analyst. \\"It doesn’t pass the smell test. Any decent propaganda operator would tell you that.\\" At a minimum, the use of the IO team against U.S. senators was a misuse of vital resources designed to combat the enemy; it cost American taxpayers roughly 6 million to deploy Holmes and his team in Afghanistan for a year. But Caldwell seemed more eager to advance his own career than to defeat the Taliban. \\"We called it Operation Fourth Star,\\" says Holmes. \\"Caldwell seemed far more focused on the Americans and the funding stream than he was on the Afghans. We were there to teach and train the Afghans. But for the first four months it was all about the U.S. Later he even started talking about targeting the NATO populations.\\" At one point, according to Holmes, Caldwell wanted to break up the IO team and give each general on his staff their own personal spokesperson with psy-ops training. The Insurgent's Tale: A Soldier Reconsiders Jihad It wasn’t the first time that Caldwell had tried to tear down the wall that has historically separated public affairs and psy-ops – the distinction the military is supposed to maintain between \\"informing\\" and \\"influencing.\\" After a stint as the top U.S. spokesperson in Iraq, the general pushed aggressively to expand the military’s use of information operations. During his time as a commander at Ft. Leavenworth, Caldwell argued for exploiting new technologies like blogging and Wikipedia – a move that would widen the military’s ability to influence the public, both foreign and domestic. According to sources close to the general, he also tried to rewrite the official doctrine on information operations, though that effort ultimately failed. (In recent months, the Pentagon has quietly dropped the nefarious-sounding moniker \\"psy-ops\\" in favor of the more neutral \\"MISO\\" – short for Military Information Support Operations.) Under duress, Holmes and his team provided Caldwell with background assessments on the visiting senators, and helped prep the general for his high-profile encounters. But according to members of his unit, Holmes did his best to resist the orders. Holmes believed that using his team to target American civilians violated the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, which was passed by Congress to prevent the State Department from using Soviet-style propaganda techniques on U.S. citizens. But when Holmes brought his concerns to Col. Gregory Breazile, the spokesperson for the Afghan training mission run by Caldwell, the discussion ended in a screaming match. \\"It’s not illegal if I say it isn’t!\\" Holmes recalls Breazile shouting. In March 2010, Breazile issued a written order that \\"directly tasked\\" Holmes to conduct an IO campaign against \\"all DV visits\\" – short for \\"distinguished visitor.\\" The team was also instructed to \\"prepare the context and develop the prep package for each visit.\\" In case the order wasn’t clear enough, Breazile added that the new instructions were to \\"take priority over all other duties.\\" Instead of fighting the Taliban, Holmes and his team were now responsible for using their training to win the hearts and minds of John McCain and Al Franken. On March 23rd, Holmes emailed the JAG lawyer who handled information operations, saying that the order made him \\"nervous.\\" The lawyer, Capt. John Scott, agreed with Holmes. \\"The short answer is that IO doesn’t do that,\\" Scott replied in an email. \\"[Public affairs] works on the hearts and minds of our own citizens and IO works on the hearts and minds of the citizens of other nations. While the twain do occasionally intersect, such intersections, like violent contact during a soccer game, should be unintentional.\\" In another email, Scott advised Holmes to seek his own defense counsel. \\"Using IO to influence our own folks is a bad idea,\\" the lawyer wrote, \\"and contrary to IO policy.\\" In a statement to Rolling Stone, a spokesman for Caldwell \\"categorically denies the assertion that the command used an Information Operations Cell to influence Distinguished Visitors.\\" But after Scott offered his legal opinion, the order was rewritten to stipulate that the IO unit should only use publicly available records to create profiles of U.S. visitors. Based on the narrower definition of the order, Holmes and his team believed the incident was behind them. Three weeks after the exchange, however, Holmes learned that he was the subject of an investigation, called an AR 15-6. The investigation had been ordered by Col. Joe Buche, Caldwell’s chief of staff. The 22-page report, obtained by Rolling Stone, reads like something put together by Kenneth Starr.

As for the operation targeting U.S. senators, there is no way to tell what, if any, influence it had on American policy. What is clear is that in January 2011, Caldwell’s command asked the Obama administration for another 2 billion to train an additional 70,000 Afghan troops – an initiative that will already cost U.S. taxpayers more than 11 billion this year. Among the biggest boosters in Washington to give Caldwell the additional money? Sen. Carl Levin, one of the senators whom Holmes had been ordered to target. ||||| The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in \\"psychological operations\\" to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned – and when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators. The Runaway General: The Rolling Stone Profile of Stanley McChrystal That Changed History The orders came from the command of Lt. Gen. William Caldwell, a three-star general in charge of training Afghan troops – the linchpin of U.S. strategy in the war. Over a four-month period last year, a military cell devoted to what is known as \\"information operations\\" at Camp Eggers in Kabul was repeatedly pressured to target visiting senators and other VIPs who met with Caldwell. When the unit resisted the order, arguing that it violated U.S. laws prohibiting the use of propaganda against American citizens, it was subjected to a campaign of retaliation. \\"My job in psy-ops is to play with people’s heads, to get the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave,\\" says Lt. Colonel Michael Holmes, the leader of the IO unit, who received an official reprimand after bucking orders. \\"I’m prohibited from doing that to our own people. When you ask me to try to use these skills on senators and congressman, you’re crossing a line.\\" Photos: Psy-Ops and the General The list of targeted visitors was long, according to interviews with members of the IO team and internal documents obtained by Rolling Stone. Those singled out in the campaign included senators John McCain, Joe Lieberman, Jack Reed, Al Franken and Carl Levin; Rep. Steve Israel of the House Appropriations Committee; Adm. Mike Mullen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Czech ambassador to Afghanistan; the German interior minister, and a host of influential think-tank analysts. The incident offers an indication of just how desperate the U.S. command in Afghanistan is to spin American civilian leaders into supporting an increasingly unpopular war. According to the Defense Department’s own definition, psy-ops – the use of propaganda and psychological tactics to influence emotions and behaviors – are supposed to be used exclusively on \\"hostile foreign groups.\\" Federal law forbids the military from practicing psy-ops on Americans, and each defense authorization bill comes with a \\"propaganda rider\\" that also prohibits such manipulation. \\"Everyone in the psy-ops, intel, and IO community knows you’re not supposed to target Americans,\\" says a veteran member of another psy-ops team who has run operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"It’s what you learn on day one.\\" The Kill Team: How U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan murdered innocent civilians and mutilated their corpses – and how their officers failed to stop them. Plus: an exclusive look at the war crime photos censored by the Pentagon When Holmes and his four-man team arrived in Afghanistan in November 2009, their mission was to assess the effects of U.S. propaganda on the Taliban and the local Afghan population. But the following month, Holmes began receiving orders from Caldwell’s staff to direct his expertise on a new target: visiting Americans. At first, the orders were administered verbally. According to Holmes, who attended at least a dozen meetings with Caldwell to discuss the operation, the general wanted the IO unit to do the kind of seemingly innocuous work usually delegated to the two dozen members of his public affairs staff: compiling detailed profiles of the VIPs, including their voting records, their likes and dislikes, and their \\"hot-button issues.\\" In one email to Holmes, Caldwell’s staff also wanted to know how to shape the general’s presentations to the visiting dignitaries, and how best to \\"refine our messaging.\\" King David's War: How Gen. Petraeus Is Doubling Down on a Failed Strategy Congressional delegations – known in military jargon as CODELs – are no strangers to spin. U.S. lawmakers routinely take trips to the frontlines in Iraq and Afghanistan, where they receive carefully orchestrated briefings and visit local markets before posing for souvenir photos in helmets and flak jackets. Informally, the trips are a way for generals to lobby congressmen and provide first-hand updates on the war. But what Caldwell was looking for was more than the usual background briefings on senators. According to Holmes, the general wanted the IO team to provide a \\"deeper analysis of pressure points we could use to leverage the delegation for more funds.\\" The general’s chief of staff also asked Holmes how Caldwell could secretly manipulate the U.S. lawmakers without their knowledge. \\"How do we get these guys to give us more people?\\" he demanded. \\"What do I have to plant inside their heads?\\" According to experts on intelligence policy, asking a psy-ops team to direct its expertise against visiting dignitaries would be like the president asking the CIA to put together background dossiers on congressional opponents. Holmes was even expected to sit in on Caldwell’s meetings with the senators and take notes, without divulging his background. \\"Putting your propaganda people in a room with senators doesn’t look good,\\" says John Pike, a leading military analyst. \\"It doesn’t pass the smell test. Any decent propaganda operator would tell you that.\\" At a minimum, the use of the IO team against U.S. senators was a misuse of vital resources designed to combat the enemy; it cost American taxpayers roughly 6 million to deploy Holmes and his team in Afghanistan for a year. But Caldwell seemed more eager to advance his own career than to defeat the Taliban. \\"We called it Operation Fourth Star,\\" says Holmes. \\"Caldwell seemed far more focused on the Americans and the funding stream than he was on the Afghans. We were there to teach and train the Afghans. But for the first four months it was all about the U.S. Later he even started talking about targeting the NATO populations.\\" At one point, according to Holmes, Caldwell wanted to break up the IO team and give each general on his staff their own personal spokesperson with psy-ops training. The Insurgent's Tale: A Soldier Reconsiders Jihad It wasn’t the first time that Caldwell had tried to tear down the wall that has historically separated public affairs and psy-ops – the distinction the military is supposed to maintain between \\"informing\\" and \\"influencing.\\" After a stint as the top U.S. spokesperson in Iraq, the general pushed aggressively to expand the military’s use of information operations. During his time as a commander at Ft. Leavenworth, Caldwell argued for exploiting new technologies like blogging and Wikipedia – a move that would widen the military’s ability to influence the public, both foreign and domestic. According to sources close to the general, he also tried to rewrite the official doctrine on information operations, though that effort ultimately failed. (In recent months, the Pentagon has quietly dropped the nefarious-sounding moniker \\"psy-ops\\" in favor of the more neutral \\"MISO\\" – short for Military Information Support Operations.) Under duress, Holmes and his team provided Caldwell with background assessments on the visiting senators, and helped prep the general for his high-profile encounters. But according to members of his unit, Holmes did his best to resist the orders. Holmes believed that using his team to target American civilians violated the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, which was passed by Congress to prevent the State Department from using Soviet-style propaganda techniques on U.S. citizens. But when Holmes brought his concerns to Col. Gregory Breazile, the spokesperson for the Afghan training mission run by Caldwell, the discussion ended in a screaming match. \\"It’s not illegal if I say it isn’t!\\" Holmes recalls Breazile shouting. In March 2010, Breazile issued a written order that \\"directly tasked\\" Holmes to conduct an IO campaign against \\"all DV visits\\" – short for \\"distinguished visitor.\\" The team was also instructed to \\"prepare the context and develop the prep package for each visit.\\" In case the order wasn’t clear enough, Breazile added that the new instructions were to \\"take priority over all other duties.\\" Instead of fighting the Taliban, Holmes and his team were now responsible for using their training to win the hearts and minds of John McCain and Al Franken. On March 23rd, Holmes emailed the JAG lawyer who handled information operations, saying that the order made him \\"nervous.\\" The lawyer, Capt. John Scott, agreed with Holmes. \\"The short answer is that IO doesn’t do that,\\" Scott replied in an email. \\"[Public affairs] works on the hearts and minds of our own citizens and IO works on the hearts and minds of the citizens of other nations. While the twain do occasionally intersect, such intersections, like violent contact during a soccer game, should be unintentional.\\" In another email, Scott advised Holmes to seek his own defense counsel. \\"Using IO to influence our own folks is a bad idea,\\" the lawyer wrote, \\"and contrary to IO policy.\\" In a statement to Rolling Stone, a spokesman for Caldwell \\"categorically denies the assertion that the command used an Information Operations Cell to influence Distinguished Visitors.\\" But after Scott offered his legal opinion, the order was rewritten to stipulate that the IO unit should only use publicly available records to create profiles of U.S. visitors. Based on the narrower definition of the order, Holmes and his team believed the incident was behind them. Three weeks after the exchange, however, Holmes learned that he was the subject of an investigation, called an AR 15-6. The investigation had been ordered by Col. Joe Buche, Caldwell’s chief of staff. The 22-page report, obtained by Rolling Stone, reads like something put together by Kenneth Starr. The investigator accuses Holmes of going off base in civilian clothes without permission, improperly using his position to start a private business, consuming alcohol, using Facebook too much, and having an \\"inappropriate\\" relationship with one of his subordinates, Maj. Laural Levine. The investigator also noted a joking comment that Holmes made on his Facebook wall, in response to a jibe about Afghan men wanting to hold his hand. \\"Hey! I’ve been here almost five months now!\\" Holmes wrote. \\"Gimmee a break a man has needs you know.\\" \\"LTC Holmes’ comments about his sexual needs,\\" the report concluded, \\"are even more distasteful in light of his status as a married man.\\" Both Holmes and Levine maintain that there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship, and said they were waiting until after they left Afghanistan to start their own business. They and other members of the team also say that they had been given permission to go off post in civilian clothes. As for Facebook, Caldwell’s command had aggressively encouraged its officers to the use the site as part of a social-networking initiative – and Holmes ranked only 15th among the biggest users. Nor was Holmes the only one who wrote silly things online. Col.

We don’t want you to fall in or miss your target.\\" Breazile now serves at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he works in the office dedicated to waging a global information war for the Pentagon.

Now, we want to find out how many elements are in the union of sets M and N (set H) which contains elements present in at least one of the sets. 4. Since there are 12 elements present in both sets, we need to subtract these from the total number of elements in each set to get the distinct elements in each set that are not in the intersection. 5.

Tonight I went with the Americano with a Mocha to go for the wife. Both are stellar drinks and I picked up a bag of the Black Market Espresso to try at home. As for the sitting, there are a few tables in the front for you to get some one on one time, 2 couches which are fairly comfy and then a lot of cafeteria like arrangements, so if you are a little shy, then grab a cup to go. I would recommend coming in and feeding off the vibe. They usually have some form of good music whether it is the speakers or a live DJ. It is a very industrial feel inside, but the energy is amazing. It is also one of the best cups of joe I have experienced in the valley (whether drinking in or taking out). The coffee has bold rich flavors and it is roasted right there onsite. If you are in during roasting hours, then that just adds to the overall experience.

The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae, which live as plankton. Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults: the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium (head); a small area round the trochophore's anus becomes the pygidium (tail-piece); a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium (the segment that contains the mouth). What is the answer to this question: What do annelid eggs become?","response":"Okay little buddy! Annelid eggs are special because they grow up into something called trochophore larvae.

After spending the first seven weeks of the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list, defensive end Richard Seymour was activated for the game, but did not start. Following a Redskins punt, in their first possession of the game, the Patriots drove 90&#160;yards over more than 7&#160;minutes, finishing the drive with a 3-yard Brady rushing touchdown, continuing a season-long opening drive scoring streak. The teams exchanged punts into the second quarter, before a 67-yard Patriots drive was capped off with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Vrabel, his second for the season and the tenth of his career (including playoffs). On the Redskins' ensuing possession, Warren recovered a Vrabel strip-sack of Jason Campbell at the Redskins' 21-yard line, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Redskins turned the ball over again on their next possession on a Samuel interception, only to regain it on the next play after Brady was strip-sacked by Phillip Daniels at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The string of turnovers continued as the Redskins drove 20&#160;yards before another Vrabel strip-sack of Campbell was again recovered by Warren. With less than 2&#160;minutes remaining in the first half, the Patriots drove 73&#160;yards, and on a fake spike play from the Redskins' 6-yard line, increased their lead to 24-0 on a touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. That touchdown pass was Brady's 29th of the season, eclipsing his career high set in 2004 and 2002, but with it only being week 8, accomplished this in only playing through the first eight of 16 games. On the opening drive of the second half, an 85-yard Patriots drive ended in another Brady touchdown run, this one from 2&#160;yards out. The Redskins committed their fourth turnover of the game on their next possession, as Vrabel strip-sacked Campbell for the third time in the game; this time Colvin recovered the fumble and returned it 11&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Patriots' lead to 38-0. The Redskins managed to reach the Patriots' 13-yard line on their next drive, but on fourth down, the Redskins could not convert and turned the ball over again. The Patriots began their next drive where they left off, going 88&#160;yards on a 14-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter. It was finished on a 2-yard touchdown reception by Welker that grew the Patriots lead to 45-0. Following a Redskins punt, on the Patriots' next series, Cassel replaced Brady. A 21-yard pass from Cassel to Gaffney gave the Patriots their 33rd first down of the game, a new single-game franchise record. Two plays later, Cassel ran it in for a touchdown from 15&#160;yards out, and the first rushing touchdown of his career, increasing the Patriots' lead to 52-0; the touchdown was the longest rushing touchdown by a Patriots quarterback in more than 20 years. The Redskins then drove 63&#160;yards and scored their only points of the game on a 15-yard Chris Cooley touchdown reception. Third-string quarterback Matt Gutierrez replaced Cassel on the next possession, a three-and-out. The Redskins then punted back to the Patriots to end the game. The Patriots' 52-7 win gave them an 8-0 record heading into a Week 9 matchup against the 7-0 Colts. It also made Brady only the second quarterback to defeat the other 31 teams at least once; the Colts' Peyton Manning was the first to accomplish the feat, having done so earlier that day.

Then we will average those percentages to find the final answer. Reasoning: 1. Find the percentage of kernels popped in each bag by dividing the number of popped kernels by the total number of kernels in the bag and multiply by 100. 2. Calculate the average of the percentages found in step 1 by adding them together and dividing by the number of bags (3 in this case). Now let's carry out these steps: 1. Calculate the percentage of kernels popped in each bag. a. Bag 1: (60 popped / 75 total) * 100 = 80% b. Bag 2: (42 popped / 50 total) * 100 = 84% c. Bag 3: (82 popped / 100 total) * 100 = 82% 2.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: Why did the group pick the color orange? === The answer to the above question is Choose from: (a). Because the FBI likes it (b). not enough information (c).

The order contains one family, Erysiphaceae. Many of them cause plant diseases called powdery mildew. - Uncinula is a genus of fungi . Its species are plant pathogens that cause powdery mildew diseases on various plant hosts . The genus is characterized by its dark chasmothecia which bear filamentous , hyaline appendages with hooked tips . Over one hundred species have been described from mostly dicotyledenous hosts . Braun and Takamatsu ( 2000 ) suggested that Uncinula should be considered a later synonym of Erysiphe ; not all subsequent researchers have accepted their conclusions . One notorious species , Uncinula necator ( syn . Erysiphe necator ) , attacks various species of grapes ( Vitis spp . ) and can cause yield losses in European wine grapes . Other Uncinula species attack a wide variety of dicotyledonous plants . - Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Powdery mildew diseases are caused by many different species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, with \\"Podosphaera xanthii\\" (a.k.a. \\"Sphaerotheca fuliginea\\") being the most commonly reported cause. \\"Erysiphe cichoracearum\\" was formerly reported to be the primary causal organism throughout most of the world. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the mildew can appear on any above-ground part of the plant. As the disease progresses, the spots get larger and denser as large numbers of asexual spores are formed, and the mildew may spread up and down the length of the plant. - Erysiphe is a genus of fungi in the Erysiphaceae family. Many of the species in this genus are plant pathogens which cause powdery mildew. - Erysiphe cichoracearum is a plant pathogen that causes powdery mildew disease of cucurbits, including melon, cucumber, pumpkin, and squash. The primary symptoms are white, powder-like spots on the leaves and stems. \\"Sphaerotheca fuliginea\\" causes a similar looking powdery mildew of cucurbits. - Mildew is a form of fungus. It is distinguished from its closely related counterpart, mold (British English: mould), largely by its color: molds appear in shades of black, blue, red, and green, whereas mildew is white. It appears as a thin, superficial growth consisting of minute hyphae (fungal filaments) produced especially on living plants or organic matter such as wood, paper or leather. Both mold and mildew produce distinct offensive odors, and both have been identified as the cause of certain human ailments.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more ice that inside the clouds happens, how will it affect LESS or LESS POWERFUL lightning. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis proposes that an increase in ice within the clouds might affect the frequency or power of lightning. In this case, the increased ice presence may have both direct and indirect effects on the lightning formation process. Direct effect: If there is more ice inside the clouds, it could result in intensified collisions among ice particles, leading to a higher buildup of electrostatic charges. As a result, this could potentially create a stronger negative charge within the cloud, attracting more positive energy on the ground and increasing the likelihood or intensity of lightning strikes. Indirect effect: An increased presence of ice in the clouds can also affect the cloud's overall structure, temperature profile, and dynamics. These changes could potentially alter the balance of positive and negative charges inside the cloud, impacting the conditions necessary for the lightning formation process. In conclusion, the presence of more ice within clouds may lead to less frequent or less powerful lightning, but the precise outcome depends on how the increased ice presence affects the cloud's electrostatic charge distribution and overall dynamics."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A woman in a white dress with blue jewelry is holding a rooster.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The woman is in her apartment.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Article: Even after centuries of exploration , the ocean still holds its mysteries. Although we know more today about the world's oceans and creatures living in them than ever before, every once in a while the sea brings up something so strange, so unexpected, that makes the world wonder what it could be. Such was the case when the currents of the Mediterranean Ocean recently washed a 13-foot-long, smelly body onto the shores of the village of Villaricos in Andalusia, Spain. An early report in the Spanish publication Lavante described the strange, horned body as what might seem like a big fish, but _ was already in pieces. Locals joked that it was some kind of Loch Ness Monster. The media jumped right on the creature, of course. Some sites called it a horned sea monster. The popular newspaper Boing Boing called it a dragon. Some people guessed that it might be an oarfish , which is actually a rarely seen kind of big fish that can grow up to 55 feet long. But now the experts have weighed in and we're sorry to report that it's not a dragon, a Loch Ness Monster, or even an oarfish. \\"That is actually a shark skeleton ,\\" Professor Grubbs from Florida State University told NBC News. \\"The parts toward the back were confusing me, but those are the lower caudal fin supports.

Your question must contain two persons --PersonX and PersonY. The expected answer to your question must be PersonX. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. There should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style, pattern, or phrases in each question, try to increase diversity by varying sentence structure, blank placement, etc. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that Person X and Person Y have the same gender. In your question, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY. Input: Context Word: lightning. Output:","response":"Part #1: Create a question containing a blank (_). Usage: \\"Who is more afraid of _ between PersonX and PersonY?\\" This meets the criteria as it leaves a blank for inserting the context word, making the question \\"Who is more afraid of lightning between PersonX and PersonY?\\" Part #2: Contain two persons -- PersonX and PersonY. Usage: \\"During a lightning storm, PersonX seeks shelter immediately while PersonY remains outside, calm and composed.\\" This meets the criteria because it involves both PersonX and PersonY in the context of a lightning storm. Part #3: The expected answer must be PersonX. Usage: \\"Who takes precautions against _ in a storm, PersonX or PersonY?\\" The correct answer should be PersonX, as they are the one being more cautious about lightning in the example given. Part #4: PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. Usage: \\"PersonX gets scared by the loud cracks of _, but PersonY is used to it since they grew up near thunderstorms.\\" This makes PersonX less likely to be okay with lightning compared to PersonY, giving a clear distinction between the two. Part #5: There should be an agreed-upon answer to fill in the blank. Usage: \\"_ has always frightened PersonX more than PersonY, who has been exposed to it often.\\" Answering with \\"lightning\\" will make sense to most people because it's a common fear and the exposure to it explains PersonY's tolerance. Part #6: Avoid explicit, offensive, or adult content. Usage: The given example does not contain any explicit or offensive content, making it an acceptable question. Part #7: Do not use the names of real people. Usage: As mentioned in the instructions, fictional names PersonX and PersonY are used to avoid referring to real people. Part #8: Variety in sentence structure, blank placement, etc. Usage: \\"While PersonX always checks the weather forecast for _, PersonY doesn't bother and finds it unnecessary.\\" This shows a variation in creating the question and placing the blank, adding diversity to the task. Part #9: The question must contain 15 to 30 words. Usage: \\"Whenever there's a hint of _, PersonX immediately unplugs all electronic devices, but PersonY thinks it's an overreaction.\\" This question fits within the word limit, containing 15 words. Part #10: Utilize the given context word. Usage: \\"PersonX prefers to stay away from tall trees during _, whereas PersonY doesn't worry about such precautions.\\" This utilizes the context word \\"lightning\\" and meets the criteria. Part #11: Use PersonX and PersonY only once and PersonX appearing earlier than PersonY. Usage: \\"PersonX wears rubber soled shoes during _, but PersonY sees no need for it.\\" This example meets the criteria by mentioning PersonX and PersonY only once, with PersonX appearing before PersonY."},{"question":"Q: Given a sentence and an entity, the task is to select the authors sentiment towards the enity.

Fossett had one of his team members develop a more advanced balloon autopilot that would allow him to sleep and do other tasks while flying safely. Steve Fossett attempted the hot-air balloon trip around the world six times. This was not easy to do. He flew in the balloon'scapsule that was too small to stand upright. During his fourth attempt in 1998, he was almost killed during a storm off the coast of Australia. He fell 9,000 meters into the Coral Sea with his balloon's capsule on fire. He was later rescued at sea. Fossett successfully made the trip in 2002. The trip started and ended in Australia. He traveled more than 33,000 kilometers for more than 14 days. On this flight, Fossett set other records including a speed record of 322 kilometers per hour. One main problem with earlier balloon flights was the threat of dangerous storms. A team of weather experts e-mailed and talked to Fossett by a satellite telephone to help him avoid such weather. Steve Fossett's hot-air balloon is now at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. It is there as an example for other people to try and succeed in doing something important to them. Steve Fossett solved the problem of bad weather on his trip by _ .

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection.

For more information visit http://www.terrapinn.com/conference/stem-cells-and-regenerative-medicine-congress/index.stm. About the Arcelis® Technology Platform Arcelis® is a fully personalized immunotherapy technology that captures mutated and variant antigens that are specific to each patient's disease. It is designed to overcome immunosuppression by producing a durable memory T-cell response without adjuvants that may be associated with toxicity. The technology is potentially applicable to a wide range of different cancers, and is designed to overcome many of the manufacturing and commercialization challenges that have impeded other personalized cancer immunotherapies. The Arcelis® process uses only a small tumor or blood sample and the patient's own dendritic cells, which are optimized from cells collected by a single leukapheresis procedure. The proprietary process uses RNA isolated from the patient's disease sample to program dendritic cells to target disease specific antigens. The activated, antigen-loaded dendritic cells are then formulated into the patient's plasma and administered via intradermal injection. Argos Therapeutics is an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of fully personalized immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer using its Arcelis® technology platform. Argos' most advanced product candidate, AGS-003, is being evaluated in the pivotal ADAPT phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). The Company is also developing a separate Arcelis®-based product candidate, AGS-004, for the treatment of HIV, currently being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial aimed at HIV eradication in adult patients.

To determine whether these subjects are the same, I will consider the possibility that the experienced climber in the second statement is a woman. Step 3: Determine the likelihood that the experienced climber is a woman. - Since the statement \\"An experienced climber descending between trees\\" does not specify the gender of the climber, it is possible that the climber is a woman. In fact, there is a 50% chance that the climber is a woman, assuming equal representation of men and women among experienced climbers. Step 4: Compare the actions in both statements. - In the first statement, the action is \\"rappels through barren treetops,\\" which involves descending from a height using ropes. - In the second statement, the action is \\"descending between trees,\\" but the mode of descent is not specified. Step 5: Determine whether the actions can be considered equivalent. - Rappelling is one of several methods for descending between trees, so if the experienced climber is rappelling, the actions in both statements would be considered equivalent. Conclusion: If \\"An experienced climber descending between trees\\" involves a female climber who is specifically rappelling, the premise \\"A woman rappels through barren treetops\\" could be true. However, as there is not enough information provided to definitively establish these matches, the given statement cannot be considered sufficient evidence to confirm the premise."},{"question":"when choosing a football game there is only really 2 choices. Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"When choosing a football game, there are primarily two choices to consider. While making a decision about which football game to pick, individuals can mainly focus on a pair of options that standout. The selection process, however, greatly depends on various factors such as personal preferences, available resources, and specific objectives. Each football game offers a unique experience, and understanding the distinguishing aspects can lead to a choice that aligns with the individual's needs and desires. The first option could be the FIFA series, developed by Electronic Arts (EA). The FIFA games are known for their realistic gameplay, stunning graphics, and authentic representation of professional football. They feature officially licensed teams, players, and leagues from around the world, which add to the immersive experience. Moreover, FIFA includes a variety of game modes such as Career Mode, Ultimate Team, and Online Multiplayer, catering to different player interests and styles. The series also benefits from annual releases, offering constant updates and improvements that keep the games fresh and engaging. The second primary choice is the Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) series, created by Konami. PES, known for its superb gameplay mechanics and focus on strategic tactics, is often praised for its attention to detail in emulating real-life football. While it lacks the full licensing rights that FIFA possesses, limiting its access to certain teams, leagues, and players, PES makes up for this shortfall with an extensive editing mode which allows users to create and customize teams and players. Furthermore, PES offers engaging game modes such as Master League, myClub, and Online Seasons, which provide players with opportunities to manage teams, scout for talent, and compete against others online. To make an informed decision, it is crucial to consider each game's unique attributes, as well as the individual's preferences and requirements. Some may prioritize licensing and graphics, which would lead them towards FIFA, while others may place gameplay mechanics and tactical depth at the forefront, causing them to gravitate towards PES. Additionally, reviews, gameplay videos, and community discussions can also be beneficial resources to consult before making the final selection. Ultimately, the choice of a football game is highly subjective and should be determined by the factors that matter most to each unique player."},{"question":"Student: Given the sentence \\"On a football field.\\" is it true that \\"A football player wearing a raiders uniform carries a football and runs away from a football player wearing a dolphins uniform.\\"?.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon. After reading the above, is \\"64 minutes\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How long from the time that the president was told a second plane hit the second tower, did it take for air sovereignty aircraft to be directed to battle stations\\"?","response":"First, we need to determine the exact time the President was told about the second plane hitting the second tower, and then find out the time when the air sovereignty aircraft were directed to battle stations. From the text: - At 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to the President: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" - At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. Now, we can calculate the time difference to find out how long it took: 9:49 (time air sovereignty aircraft directed to battle stations) - 9:05 (time President was told about the second plane) = 44 minutes So, the correct answer to the question \\"How long from the time that the president was told a second plane hit the second tower, did it take for air sovereignty aircraft to be directed to battle stations?\\" is 44 minutes, not 64 minutes."},{"question":"Q:FINAL EXAM Question 1.

(CNN) -- The scourge of racism within football has reared its head once again, with Inter Milan charged by UEFA over \\"racist behavior\\" of its supporters during last week's Europe League contest against Tottenham Hotspur. The Italian club has also been charged with \\"insufficient organization\\" and \\"throwing of missiles and/or fireworks.\\" Inter supporters are alleged to have taunted the English team's Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor and other black players with monkey chants -- actions which were reported to European soccer's ruling body by the match delegate. The case will be heard on April 19. Inter won the match 4-1 but was eliminated from Europe's second-tier competition on the away goals rule with the aggregate score tied at 4-4. In January, the president of football's world governing body","response":"FIFA, Gianni Infantino, condemned racism in the sport, calling it a \\"disgrace and shameful anomaly.\\" Infantino went on to express his commitment to the eradication of racism and any form of discrimination from the sport. As the case of the racist behavior of Inter Milan supporters went to hearing on April 19, the UEFA disciplinary panel decided to take strong action against the Italian club. The panel found the club guilty of all charges and imposed heavy penalties, in order to send a strong message that such actions would not be tolerated in the soccer community. Inter Milan was fined €150,000 for the racist behavior of its supporters, as well as for insufficient organization and throwing of missiles and/or fireworks. Additionally, the club was required to play its next two European home matches behind closed doors, with no spectators allowed. This not only served as a punishment for the club but also as an opportunity for its supporters to reflect on their actions and understand the consequences of such behavior. The Touchline Racism institute, a non-profit organization aiming to combat racism in sports, commended UEFA's disciplinary panel for its decision to impose such strong sanctions. Following the penalties imposed on Inter Milan, other soccer clubs across Europe decided to take proactive measures to ensure that similar incidents did not occur in their stadiums. Many clubs introduced rigorous anti-racism campaigns, both internally and externally, which aimed to educate players, staff, and supporters on the importance of diversity and inclusion in soccer. Clubs also began to work closely with local law enforcement authorities to identify and punish individuals who engaged in racist behavior during matches. In the months following the Inter Milan incident, racism within football slowly began to decline. International and domestic soccer governing bodies pledged to work together to combat racism in the sport, allocating additional resources and implementing harsher penalties for offenders. They took a zero-tolerance approach towards any form of discrimination, and players, clubs, and supporters found guilty of racist behavior faced severe consequences. In the end, the story of racist behavior during the Inter Milan and Tottenham Hotspur match became a pivotal moment in the fight against racism in soccer. Members of the soccer community from all around the world came together to condemn such actions, which led to positive changes in the sport. The incident served as a wake-up call for the entire soccer world, putting into motion the long-overdue eradication of racism from the game. Eventually, soccer venues became more welcoming and inclusive spaces for all, and the triumph of the collective spirit in fighting discrimination brought forth a new era in the world of football."},{"question":"Given the following context: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts.

In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years.

As the only child of well-to-do parents living in the San Remo on Central Park West, he was described in Meryle Secrest's biography (Stephen Sondheim: A Life) as an isolated, emotionally-neglected child. When he lived in New York, Sondheim attended ECFS, the Ethical Culture Fieldston School known simply as \\"Fieldston.\\" He later attended the New York Military Academy and George School, a private Quaker preparatory school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where he wrote his first musical, By George, and from which he graduated in 1946. Sondheim spent several summers at Camp Androscoggin. He later matriculated to Williams College and graduated in 1950. He traces his interest in theatre to Very Warm for May, a Broadway musical he saw when he was nine. \\"The curtain went up and revealed a piano,\\" Sondheim recalled. \\"A butler took a duster and brushed it up, tinkling the keys. I thought that was thrilling.\\" When Sondheim was ten, his father (already a distant figure) left his mother for another woman (Alicia, with whom he had two sons). Herbert sought custody of Stephen but was unsuccessful. Sondheim explained to biographer Secrest that he was \\"what they call an institutionalized child, meaning one who has no contact with any kind of family. You're in, though it's luxurious, you're in an environment that supplies you with everything but human contact. No brothers and sisters, no parents, and yet plenty to eat, and friends to play with and a warm bed, you know?\\" Sondheim detested his mother, who was said to be psychologically abusive and projected her anger from her failed marriage on her son: \\"When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to come on to and to berate, beat up on, you see. What she did for five years was treat me like dirt, but come on to me at the same time.\\" She once wrote him a letter saying that the \\"only regret [she] ever had was giving him birth.\\" When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral and had already been estranged from her for nearly 20 years at that point. Burt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party; Sondheim arrived before him, and knew no one else well. He saw a familiar face: Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of Saturday Night, and they began talking. Laurents told him he was working on a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with Leonard Bernstein, but they needed a lyricist; Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood. He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from Saturday Night and he could audition for Bernstein. Sondheim met Bernstein the following day, played for him and Bernstein said he would let him know. The composer wanted to write music and lyrics; after consulting with Hammerstein, Bernstein told Sondheim he could write music later. In 1957, West Side Story opened; directed by Jerome Robbins, it ran for 732 performances. Sondheim has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. While Bernstein was working on Candide, Sondheim reportedly wrote some of West Side Story's music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from West Side Story during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off. Sondheim insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list him as the sole lyricist. He described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he wanted the credit. Sondheim later said he wished \\"someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage\\". After West Side Story opened, Shevelove lamented the lack of \\"low-brow comedy\\" on Broadway and mentioned a possible musical based on Plautus' Roman comedies. When Sondheim was interested in the idea he called a friend, Larry Gelbart, to co-write the script. The show went through a number of drafts, and was interrupted briefly by Sondheim's next project. In 1959, Sondheim was approached by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman - cast as Mama Rose - had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music. Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star would be a good learning experience. Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances. Merrily's failure greatly affected Sondheim; he was ready to quit theatre and do movies, create video games or write mysteries: \\"I wanted to find something to satisfy myself that does not involve Broadway and dealing with all those people who hate me and hate Hal.\\" Sondheim and Prince's collaboration was suspended from Merrily to the 2003 production of Bounce, another failure. However, Sondheim decided \\"that there are better places to start a show\\" and found a new collaborator in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: \\"I was discouraged, and I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre\\"; Lapine has a taste \\"for the avant-garde and for visually-oriented theatre in particular\\". Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017. They collaborated on Into the Woods (1987), a musical based on several Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Although Sondheim has been called the first composer to bring rap music to Broadway (with the Witch in the opening number of \\"Into the Woods\\"), he attributes the first rap in theatre to Meredith Willson's \\"Rock Island\\" from The Music Man. The show was revived on Broadway in 2002. Sondheim and Lapine's last work together was the rhapsodic Passion (1994), adapted from Ettore Scola's Italian film Passione D'Amore. With a run of 280 performances, Passion was the shortest-running show to win a Tony Award for Best Musical. Question: Was this last work a success? Answer:","response":"While Passion, the last collaboration between Sondheim and Lapine, did not achieve the same level of commercial success as some of their previous works, with a run of 280 performances, it still made a significant impact in the theatrical world. The musical won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1994, making it the shortest-running show to win this prestigious award. Additionally, it garnered critical acclaim for its emotional depth, complex characters, and an unconventional take on love and obsession. Although it may not have had a lengthy run on Broadway, the show's artistic achievements, accolades, and recognition, particularly in winning the coveted Tony Award, demonstrated that Passion had its own version of success within the broader context of musical theater. The collaboration between Sondheim and Lapine produced a work that pushed boundaries and left a lasting impression in the American musical theater landscape."},{"question":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: Greider suggests we could replay the terrible conflicts of the twentieth century. Sentence 2: One suggestion was to replay conflicts of the twentieth century. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Choices: + yes + it is not possible to tell + no","response":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Let's analyze both sentences to understand why: Sentence 1: Greider suggests we could replay the terrible conflicts of the twentieth century. In this sentence, Greider is mentioned as making a suggestion. The suggestion is about the possibility of replaying the terrible conflicts of the twentieth century. We don't know the context or reasoning behind Greider's suggestion, but the statement confirms that Greider has indeed made this suggestion. Sentence 2: One suggestion was to replay conflicts of the twentieth century. This sentence speaks about a suggestion that was made, and the suggestion is to replay conflicts of the twentieth century. The sentence does not mention Greider or any other individual, but the suggestion made is essentially the same as the one mentioned in Sentence 1. Based on the analysis of both sentences, we can see a parallelism between the content of the suggestions. If Sentence 1, which says that Greider made a particular suggestion, is true, then it logically follows that Sentence 2, which states that a suggestion was made (without specifying by whom), must also be true. The suggestions in both sentences align with each other, thereby confirming that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is also true.

Click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game, including Neymar's heatmap More than any other teams in world football, Brazil and Argentina have come to be defined, in recent years, by their No 10s. In Barcelona duo Lionel Messi and Neymar, the South American giants have arguably the best two players in the world in that position, and both teams are built around their respective superstars. But how did the pair compare when they met in Beijing on Saturday? Barcelona striker Neymar, celebrating with goal scorer Diego Tardelli, was in fine form against Argentina INFLUENCE It might not be right to describe Brazil vs Argentina as simply Neymar vs Messi - but both teams rely so heavily on their star man that if either goes missing, the whole side can lose their way.","response":"In Saturday's highly anticipated encounter in Beijing, the two South American powerhouses faced off in a thrilling match that emphasized the importance of their number 10s. Neymar and Messi were at the heart of everything for their respective teams, showcasing not only their individual brilliance but also their ability to bring the best out of their teammates. While both Neymar and Messi demonstrated their exceptional talent throughout the match, it was the Brazilian forward who stole the show. Neymar's influence on the game proved instrumental in Brazil's victory, as he played a crucial role in creating the openings that allowed his teammates to capitalize on Argentina's vulnerabilities. Neymar, who has been in stunning form for both Brazil and Barcelona this season, was heavily involved from the outset of the match. His mazy runs, mesmerizing skills, and pinpoint passes were a constant threat to Argentina's defense, which struggled to contain the 28-year-old superstar. On the other hand, Messi, who is often hailed as the best player of all time, found it difficult to impose himself on the game as effectively as his Brazilian counterpart. Though the Argentine captain showed glimpses of his incredible ability, he was unable to carry his team to victory on this occasion. One of the pivotal moments of the game came in the second half when Neymar skillfully navigated his way through a sea of Argentine defenders, weaving past one challenge after another, before laying the ball off to his teammate Diego Tardelli. Tardelli showed great composure to slot the ball past Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Romero and give Brazil the lead. As the match wore on, Argentina tried desperately to get back into the game, with Messi attempting to lead the charge. Despite some impressive moments from the number 10, Argentina was unable to find the equalizer, and the game ended in a 1-0 victory for Brazil. The post-match statistics further highlighted Neymar's superior influence on the game, as he completed more dribbles, created more chances, and had a higher pass accuracy than Messi. Additionally, Neymar's heatmap revealed that he covered a substantial amount of ground across the field, while Messi was comparatively more constrained in his movements. In the end, both Neymar and Messi displayed their immense talent on the grand stage, but it was the Brazilian who shone brightest in this particular encounter. While it may be unfair to reduce the game to a simple Neymar vs Messi duel, their individual performances undeniably played a significant role in determining the outcome. As Brazil and Argentina continue to be defined by their No 10s, it will be fascinating to witness how these two extraordinary players continue to shape the destinies of their national teams in future clashes. But on this occasion, it was Neymar who emerged as the undisputed star, carrying his team to a hard-fought victory and cementing his status as one of the world's best players."},{"question":"Choose your story that continues the following story. The ribs cooked by Katrina are much better tasting than Megan's because Choices: I. Katrina uses a delicious sauce.. II. Megan uses a delicious sauce..","response":"I. Katrina uses a delicious sauce. As the tantalizing aroma of the slowly cooking ribs wafts through the air, it becomes abundantly clear that the key to the vastly superior taste of Katrina's ribs lies in her delicious sauce. With every bite, a burst of flavors takes over, making it an unforgettable culinary experience for anyone fortunate enough to taste it. Katrina's sauce is a delectable concoction, honed to perfection after years of experimentation and adjustments. It all starts with her selection of the finest, freshest ingredients, each meticulously chosen to complement and build upon the flavor profile of the dish. Her sauce features a mix of tangy, sweet, and spicy elements crafted from a delightful blend of ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, and her secret mix of spices. This exquisite combination creates an impeccable balance that heightens the already appetizing taste of the ribs themselves. From working with several experts in the culinary world, Katrina has spent countless hours perfecting her recipe and refining her cooking techniques. By utilizing slow cooking methods, she ensures that her ribs are tender and juicy, allowing them to absorb the delectable sauce thoroughly. As a result, the ribs take on a unique, mouth-watering flavor that accentuates the succulence of the meat and the pleasantly smoky notes from the barbecue. Moreover, Katrina understands that achieving consistent quality requires systematic excellence. Each step of the cooking process – from selecting the ribs, seasoning them, and cooking them to the precise moment of doneness – is carried out with a focus on detail and unwavering dedication to the craft. Katrina's expertise in cooking techniques doesn't end there. Her attention to detail is showcased by her mastery of the art of basting. She pays close attention to the heat of the grill, ensuring that the ribs never char and are cooked evenly. Applying her sauce at optimal intervals is also one of her secrets. This allows it to caramelize on the ribs, enveloping them in a rich, glossy finish that adds an irresistible aroma and a slightly sticky texture. On the other hand, Megan's ribs, while not unpalatable in their own right, fall short when compared to Katrina's culinary masterpieces. Megan's ribs, although tender, lack the depth of flavor and the exquisite balance that is present in Katrina's sauce. Additionally, Megan's sauce, while still appetizing, seems somewhat one-dimensional and fails to provide that same burst of tangy, sweet, and spicy delight. In conclusion, the succulent, flavorful ribs, coupled with her delicious sauce, make Katrina's cooking a clear winner over Megan's. With her unique blend of ingredients, attention to detail, and mastery of cooking techniques, Katrina elevates the humble barbecue to an unforgettable taste sensation that keeps people eagerly coming back for more."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A group of old classmates, who have succeeded in their work, got together to visit their old university professor.

The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier. But I can use this background: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. What is an answer for this question: Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta?

For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. Paragraph: There is currently a wildfire in the city of Milton and another one in the city of Parth. These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are air currents in Parth traveling uphill or downhill? Answer:","response":"Air currents in Parth are traveling downhill.

Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles.

(Photo: Brennan Linsley/AP ) Vice President Biden wrapped up a Week of Action campaign on Friday, part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, at the University of Colorado in front of a packed audience, where he spoke about the need for each student to help change the culture of sexual assault. The campaign is part of the White House’s It’s On Us initiative, launched in 2014, which urges students to make a “personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault,” and which provides tools to help empower and equip students and administrations to both better understand and tackle the issue. Biden asked the crowd to raise their right hands and repeat the It’s On Us pledge, what the organization says is a “personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault.” “I pledge to recognize that non-consensual sex is sexual assault. To identify situations in which sexual assault may occur. To intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given. To create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.” Throughout his speech, Biden called on college administrators to help make their campuses safe, and focused on the need to hear from the victims themselves. “Every time you talk about it, it comes back. It comes back. It takes courage (to speak up), but they’re all saving lives,” Biden said. “Think about how many voices are on this campus that you haven’t heard but you know are there, crying silently.” Vice President Joe Biden kisses University of Colorado sophomore Emma Beach after seeing her crying after speaking about sexual violence on campus as part of the “It’s On Us” campaign April 8, 2016, at the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, Colo.

With paper as an effective substitute for silk in many applications, China could export silk in greater quantity, contributing to a Golden Age. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Which Age did the invention of the papermaking process not contribute towards?","response":"The invention of the papermaking process, attributed to Cai Lun in the 2nd century AD, directly contributed to the Han Dynasty and subsequent Golden Age of China by allowing for greater exports of silk. However, it did not contribute towards the Bronze Age, which occurred much earlier, dating back to around 3300 BCE to 1200 BCE. The Bronze Age was a time of significant technological advancements including the use of bronze, a metal alloy made up of copper and tin. This period saw improvements in metallurgy, agriculture, and the development of early city-states. Writing during the Bronze Age relied mainly on clay tablets, stone inscriptions, or, in the case of ancient Egypt, papyrus. It was long before the invention of the papermaking process by Cai Lun in the Han Dynasty in China. Therefore, the invention of the papermaking process did not contribute towards the Bronze Age, as it came much later in human history and was not connected to the advancements made during that time."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - Roger Eugene Maris (September 10, 1934 December 14, 1985) was an American professional baseball player who played four seasons in the minor leagues and twelve seasons in the major leagues. Maris played right field on four Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, from 1957 through 1968. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR, also \\"homer\\", \\"dinger\\", \\"dong\\", \\"bomb\\", \\"blast\\", \\"goner\\" , \\"shot\\", or \\"four-bagger\\") is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run. There is also the \\"inside-the-park\\" home run, increasingly rare in modern baseball, where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field. When a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored, and an RBI for each runner that scores, including himself. Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit, and a run for each runner that scores including the batter. - The outfield is a sporting term used in cricket and baseball to refer to the area of the field of play further from the batsman or batter than the infield, and in association football to players outside the goal. - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced.

In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum.

To do that, add 135*m on both sides: -135*m + 135*m = 288*m - 16649 + 135*m 0 = 423*m - 16649 Now, isolate 'm' by adding 16649 on both sides: 16649 = 423*m Step 3: Solve for the variable 'm'. To find the value of 'm', we need to divide both sides by 423: 16649 / 423 = 423*m / 423 39.375295 = m So, the value of 'm' is approximately 39.375295."},{"question":"Write the last sentence in this story.

Therefore, I will be presenting a thorough discourse on the topic of brevity in sentence construction and its significance in the English language. Brevity in sentence construction is the art of conveying a message effectively using the fewest words possible, while still maintaining clarity and precision. It allows readers to grasp the meaning of a sentence quickly and easily. However, achieving the right balance between simplicity and depth can be a challenge. Too few words may lead to misinterpretation or ambiguity, while too many can make a sentence convoluted and difficult to comprehend. There are several reasons why brevity is important in writing and communication. First, it respects the reader's time and cognitive resources. With the ever-growing abundance of information available, people have become more selective in the content they consume. Brief and straightforward sentences are more appealing as they facilitate faster comprehension, enabling readers to process more information in a shorter amount of time. Second, brevity improves clarity. Keeping a sentence concise and limited to one main idea helps eliminate unnecessary words or phrases that could obscure the intended message. This is particularly important in formal writing, such as academic papers, legal documents, and business communications, where clarity and specificity are crucial. Third, short sentences can enhance the impact of a text. A well-crafted short sentence can be powerful and memorable, leaving a lasting impression on the reader. Moreover, varying sentence length adds rhythm and dynamism to a piece of writing, making it more engaging and enjoyable to read. To construct brief sentences effectively, consider the following strategies: 1. Be mindful of the main point: Identify the central message or idea of the sentence and eliminate extraneous details that do not contribute to its meaning. 2. Use active voice: Active voice often leads to shorter and more straightforward sentences, as opposed to the passive voice, which can introduce unnecessary complexity. 3. Opt for simpler words: Choose shorter and more common words, while avoiding verbose expressions and jargon that could potentially cause confusion. 4. Revise and edit: Upon finishing the initial draft, review and fine-tune the text by eliminating redundant words, phrases, or clauses. In conclusion, brevity in sentence construction is an essential skill in effective communication. By crafting concise and clear sentences, writers facilitate comprehension, improve clarity, and create a more dynamic and engaging reading experience. By being mindful of the main point, using active voice, employing simple words, and revising and editing the text, one can achieve brevity without sacrificing the depth and precision of the message."},{"question":"Please answer a question about the following article about Richmond, Virginia: Richmond recovered quickly from the war, and by 1782 was once again a thriving city.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"Is the Iranian government for or against women activists?\\" Response: \\"Against\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. The passage discusses the Iranian government's strategy against the women's movement and its targeting of women activists, which indicates that the Iranian government is against women activists."},{"question":"Unknown document property name.

This powerful raptor, known for its majestic appearance, experienced significant fluctuations in numbers throughout the twentieth century. This article will explore the population of bald eagles in two distinct time periods, 1980 and 1992, to determine where the species had more abundant populations. Background Before diving deep into the comparison of bald eagle populations in 1980 and 1992, it is crucial to understand the factors that influenced the species' conservation status during this time. Bald eagles were once thriving and widespread throughout North America, numbering nearly half a million before European settlement. However, by the mid-twentieth century, their populations suffered drastic declines primarily due to habitat loss, hunting, and the devastating effects of the insecticide, DDT. DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) became widely used in the United States during the 1940s to combat malaria and control pests. It accumulated in the fatty tissues of organisms, including fish, the primary food source for the bald eagles. As a result, DDT would concentrate in their bodies, leading to weakened eggshells and disrupted reproductive success. In 1963, there were only 417 documented nesting pairs of bald eagles in the contiguous United States, which resulted in the species being added to the endangered species list. Taking notice of their rapid decline, several federal and state-led conservation initiatives were implemented to protect and restore the bald eagle population. In 1972, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of DDT, and in 1973, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed to protect the species and its habitat. These conservation measures were pivotal in reviving the bald eagle populations, setting the stage for the species' slow but steady resurgence. Comparison: Bald Eagle Population in 1980 vs. 1992 By 1980, almost a decade after the DDT ban and the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, bald eagles had begun their arduous recovery. Nevertheless, populations were still not stabilized. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) records, there were approximately 1,550 nesting pairs in the contiguous United States in that year. Successful breeding and nesting were observed in several states, though still a far cry from the healthy population levels of pre-DDT era. Within the subsequent 12 years, bald eagles experienced significant progress as conservation efforts continued to unfold. FWS reports reveal that by 1992, the number of nesting pairs had risen to approximately 4,450 in the contiguous United States. Furthermore, the species reestablished itself in numerous states across the nation. This remarkable increase was a testament to the tireless endeavors of conservationists, federal, and state agencies that sought to ensure the survival of the bald eagle. Several factors contributed to the population growth in those 12 years, including: 1. The DDT ban, which led to the gradual recovery of affected ecosystems. 2. Legal protection afforded by the Endangered Species Act. 3. Conservation programs that actively monitored and protected bald eagle nests. 4. Restoration of vital habitats, like wetlands, for nesting and hunting. 5. Public awareness campaigns that raised consciousness about the plight of the bald eagle. Conclusion By contrasting the bald eagle population numbers in 1980 and 1992, it becomes evident that there were significantly more of these majestic birds in 1992. The combined impact of numerous conservation efforts, such as the banning of DDT, legal protection, habitat restoration, and increased public awareness, and the tireless efforts of various stakeholders fueled the recovery of this iconic species. The bald eagle's journey is indeed a prime example of the power of conservation and proof that it is possible to reverse the tragic decline of a species through dedication, collaboration, and determination."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The \\"McCarthy witch hunts\\" were a series of investigations and hearings led by Senator Joseph McCarthy, claiming that numerous communists and Soviet agents had infiltrated various aspects of American society and government. This period of intense anti-communist suspicion and the persecution of alleged sympathizers led to a tense and fearful atmosphere, causing widespread panic and social disruption. It was during this tumultuous time that Miller penned \\"The Crucible.\\" \\"The Crucible\\" is set in the 1690s in the Puritan village of Salem, Massachusetts, during the infamous Salem witch trials. Although the story revolves around the events and characters of the historic trials, Miller drew parallels to the McCarthy hearings and used the play as a social commentary on the political climate of 1950s America. In \\"The Crucible,\\" the citizens of Salem are caught up in the hysteria of witchcraft accusations, leading to a series of false confessions, betrayals, and mistrust. More than a simple retelling of the Salem witch trials, the play delves into the nature of fear, personal responsibility, and the corrosion of community values. By presenting this narrative in a historical context and incorporating the themes of mass hysteria and persecution, Miller effectively evoked the similarities between the witch hunts of the 17th century and the governmental witch hunts occurring in his contemporary America. The themes prevalent in \\"The Crucible\\" still resonate with audiences today, as it reflects society's tendency to succumb to fear and allow hysteria to drive irrational decisions that can lead to devastating consequences. The allegorical elements of the play mirror the political climate of the time, making it a powerful reflection on both the Salem witch trials and the McCarthy era. Miller's portrayal of a society torn apart by fear and suspicion remains one of the most impactful and enduring stage works in American dramatic literature. As \\"The Crucible\\" continues to be performed around the world, it serves as a cautionary reminder of the dangers of hysteria and the importance of examining our own choices, beliefs, and actions in the face of fear and prejudice."},{"question":"There are 120 crayons in a box. One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used. How many are slightly used? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To find out how many crayons are slightly used, we'll first need to calculate the number of new and broken crayons. There are a total of 120 crayons in the box. 1. New crayons: One third (1/3) of the crayons are new. To find out how many new crayons there are, multiply the total number of crayons (120) by 1/3. 120 * (1/3) = 40 crayons So, there are 40 new crayons in the box. 2. Broken crayons: 20% of the crayons are broken. To find out how many broken crayons there are, multiply the total number of crayons (120) by 20%. 120 * (20/100) = 24 crayons So, there are 24 broken crayons in the box. Now, we need to find the remaining, slightly used crayons. To do this, subtract the number of new and broken crayons from the total number of crayons: Total crayons - New crayons - Broken crayons = Slightly used crayons 120 crayons - 40 crayons - 24 crayons = 56 crayons So, there are 56 slightly used crayons in the box."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: What is likely the job of the people who conducted the study at Deakin University? Options: - They are most likely researchers at the university. - not enough information - They are probably the owners of a facility that makes macaroni and cheese. - They are most likely world famous chefs. === The correct answer is A:","response":"They are most likely researchers at the university."},{"question":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

Lina Alvarez’s daughter, who she has christened with the same first name, was delivered two weeks ahead of schedule by Caeserean section. The mother-of-three, from Lugo in north-west Spain, began the menopause 20 years ago but underwent fertility treatment to have more babies. Her pregnancy ignited a heated debate in her native country over calls to potentially cap the age limit for IVF treatment. Lina Alvarez was told she had only a five per cent chance of giving birth to a healthy baby La Página A series of gynecologists also said a successful pregnancy would be nigh on impossible and refused to help her. Her healthy daughter weighed 5.2lbs. “I’m the happiest person on the planet, everything went perfectly,” she said. “When she is 30, I’ll be 90. She’ll have been raised and life expectancy for women is growing all the time. “I always wanted to be a mother again but most medical experts said ‘no’. “I feel like I’m having a second chance and the pregnancy has made me younger and stronger.” Her eldest son, 28-year-old Exiquio, is disabled after a gynaecologist damaged his head during a routine test while she was pregnant. Ms Alvarez had her second child, Sam, at the age of 52 after her IVF treatment. He said: “My emotions have got the better of me and I’ve been crying a lot out of happiness.” The world’s oldest person to give birth is thought to be Daljinder Kaur, from India, who believes she is around 70 years old, and who had her first child earlier this year. ||||| A Spanish woman said she felt \\"phenomenal\\" after giving birth at the age of 62. Lina Alvarez posed with her week-old daughter as she left the hospital in the Galician city of Lugo after her Caesarian section. \\"I couldn't feel happier\\", the doctor said tearfully on the steps of Lucas Augusti Hospital. Ms Alvarez, whose daughter shares her name, sparked debate in her home nation by announcing last month she was eight months pregnant with her third child. The new arrival was born two weeks ahead of schedule last Monday weighing 5.2lbs after her mother was admitted for observation when she began to suffer high blood pressure. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A 62-year-old Spanish doctor named Lina Alvarez gave birth to a healthy baby girl, also named Lina.

Some people in Spain were not happy about her having a baby at her age and it started a big discussion about putting an age limit on a special treatment called IVF, which helps women have babies.

Passion is the single most important ingredient for a successful business. If you don't love what you do, entrepreneurship will be a constant grind that ends in defeat.","response":"Always be prepared to face failure. Successful entrepreneurs view failure as a part of their journey, not the end. They understand that each failure is a learning opportunity that brings them one step closer to success. Use setbacks to refine your strategy or reshape your product. Conduct post-mortems to understand what went wrong and how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. Every failure is an opportunity to grow and to become better. Foster resilience. Entrepreneurship is a long, challenging journey and there will be many obstacles along the way. You'll need the resilience to deal with problems and setbacks as they arise. On tough days, remember why you started your business in the first place. Embrace flexibility and adaptability. The road to success is rarely a straight line. There may be detours and roadblocks, and you may need to change your plan entirely. Adaptability is essential to navigate these challenges, be it adopting a new technology, stepping into an unfamiliar market, or pivoting your business model. Strengthen your network. Your network is one of your most valuable resources as an entrepreneur. It includes your mentors, peers, employees, partners, customers, and investors. Establish robust relationships based on mutual benefit. Be ready to learn from others, share your knowledge, and collaborate when possible. You'll gain invaluable insights, advice, and support that you can't acquire in any other way. Continuous learning and development. Successful entrepreneurs never stop learning. Whether it's taking a course, reading a book, listening to podcasts, attending seminars and workshops, or using an online platform, always look for ways to enhance your skills and acquire new knowledge. Entrepreneurship is a rapidly changing field, and the skills that are relevant today may not be relevant tomorrow. Focus on customer satisfaction. Without customers, there's no business. Always strive to understand your customers' needs and offer them products and services that exceed their expectations. This not only ensures repeat business from current clients but also attracts new customers through positive word of mouth. Prioritize financial literacy. Understanding your business’s financials is crucial. This means being adept at creating and reading income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. Knowing the financial pulse of your business can help inform your decision-making and ensure your business remains on a path toward profitability. Remember, patience is key. Success won't happen overnight. It may take weeks, months, or even years to get where you want to go. With determination, hard work, and patience, you can overcome hurdles and achieve success in the entrepreneurial world. Above all, maintain a balance in your life. While the drive to succeed is crucial, it shouldn't come at the expense of your relationships, health, or peace of mind. Success is not just earning money or achieving goals, it's also about enjoying the journey and appreciating the patterns of growth and development you experience along the way. Hence, take care of yourself, eat healthily, stay active, maintain strong relationships, and ensure that you value and cherish what's genuinely important. Finally, no matter how successful you become, stay humble. Never forget where you've come from and those who have helped you along the way. The best leaders remain grounded, treat others with respect, and continue to serve as an inspiration to their team and others around them. This spirit of passion, resilience, continuous learning, adaptability, network building, customer focus, financial literacy, patience, self-care, and humility can make a successful entrepreneur out of any ambitious individual."},{"question":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism. He argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds. The presence of noble women in the French \\"lodges of adoption\\" that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.

Step 4: I replaced the word \\"that\\" with a semicolon to emphasize the connection between \\"they are just people\\" and \\"they have their own interests and desires\\" and separate them into two independent clauses.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The people are shouting\\" - Sentence B: \\"The people are quietly shouting\\"","response":"To determine which sentence doesn't make sense, let's analyze each sentence step-by-step. Sentence A: \\"The people are shouting\\" 1. \\"The people\\" - A group of individuals. 2. \\"are\\" - The verb to be, indicating a present action. 3. \\"shouting\\" - A verb describing the action of making a loud, forceful sound with one's voice. This sentence makes sense, as it describes a group of people making loud noises. Sentence B: \\"The people are quietly shouting\\" 1. \\"The people\\" - A group of individuals. 2. \\"are\\" - The verb to be, indicating a present action. 3. \\"quietly\\" - An adverb describing the manner of the action that follows. 4. \\"shouting\\" - A verb describing the action of making a loud, forceful sound with one's voice. In this sentence, there is a contradiction between the adverb \\"quietly\\" and the verb \\"shouting.\\" Shouting is typically a loud and forceful action, while \\"quietly\\" suggests a more subdued volume or intensity. Therefore, this sentence doesn't make sense as it presents an illogical combination of quiet shouting. Based on the analysis above, Sentence B: \\"The people are quietly shouting\\" doesn't make sense."},{"question":"Add spaces: Stanozololenhancesendurancebyincreasingredbloodcellcount,increasesnitrogenretentionandproteinsynthesis.","response":"Step 1: Identify the individual words in the sentence.

The carbon dioxide is then stored in another form. Carbon is sequestered naturally by forests. Trees take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Artificial methods of sequestering carbon underground are being researched. This is just one of the geoengineering methods that are being researched for reducing carbon dioxide. Q: What captures carbon dioxide as it is emitted by a power plant before it enters the atmosphere? A: Answer:","response":"The process of Carbon sequestration is capable of capturing carbon dioxide as it is emitted by a power plant before it enters the atmosphere. This process essentially involves the capture and long-term storage of carbon dioxide to mitigate or defer global warming and avoid dangerous climate change. In the context of power plants, the idea is to prevent the release of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere from fossil fuel use in stationary power generation and industrial processes. The capture takes place at the source of emission, which could be a power plant or industrial site, that emits a large volume of CO2. Moreso, Carbon sequestration is not only limited to artificial or industrial processes. It also occurs naturally, especially in forests. Trees, through the process of photosynthesis, also absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, thus helping to keep the planet's atmosphere balanced. While natural methods of sequestration have been in place for countless years, humans have also devised artificial methods to enhance this process. Underground carbon sequestration, which involves intentional storing of CO2 in underground geological formations, is one such method that is being currently researched extensively. All these methods of carbon sequestration play a crucial role in the broader concept of geoengineering, which is essentially manipulating the planet's environment to counteract the effects of global warming caused by elevated levels of CO2. Geoengineering presents a range of strategies, including carbon dioxide removal methods and solar radiation management, to tackle the pressing issue of climate change. We can, therefore, conclude that carbon sequestration, both natural and artificial, serves as a critical tool in our collective efforts to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases and combat climate change."},{"question":"elements of the old government tried to secure the release of people arrested at the orders of the committee.

Context: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: Who was angry as the bus rode on? Options: A. The man who offered his seat to the woman who had to move B. not enough information C. The woman who had to move D. The wife of the man who offered his seat The answer is:","response":"C. The woman who had to move"},{"question":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus.\\" if \\"the person is sleeping\\"?","response":"Analyzing the task, we can see it involves integrating two different pieces of information and assessing whether they can coexist. The first piece of information is: \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus.\\" The second piece of information is: \\"The person is sleeping.\\" Now let's look at these two statements together, step-by-step: 1. The first statement: It describes a person with long hair, located on the top level of a double-decker bus, actively doing something: they are staring out of the window. This implies that the person is conscious and awake to be able to perform these activities. 2. The second statement: It simply states that the person is sleeping. Sleeping is a state of unconsciousness where the person is not aware of their surroundings and therefore, most likely, not capable of performing any conscious activity like the aforementioned staring out of the window. Considering these two points, it seems the two statements are logically inconsistent. However, one possible interpretation could be that the first statement described the person before they fell asleep, and the second statement describes them afterwards. But without this context, we cannot assume that is the case. In conclusion, based on the given information, it's not possible to conclude that \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus\\" if \\"the person is sleeping\\", as these two things cannot occur simultaneously under normal circumstances. The states of being awake and sleeping are mutually exclusive, and staring out of the window requires the person to be awake."},{"question":"Aubrey turned Sydney back around to tell a joke about the clown and the doctor.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"Why was Shiva Nazar Ahari put in prison?\\" Answer: \\"Alleged adultery\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: (1). no; (2). yes;","response":"(1). no; The paragraph states that Shiva Nazar Ahari was put in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God.\\" This catch-all offense is used for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record.

Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in Greek and Roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.\\" Answer:","response":"In 1558, Queen Elizabeth I became the ruler of England and Ireland. She was the daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and she ascended to the throne following the death of her half-sister, Queen Mary I. Elizabeth I's reign, also known as the Elizabethan era, was a significant period in English history and marked the beginning of the English Renaissance. During her rule, Queen Elizabeth I implemented several religious reforms that contributed to the end of medieval drama. One of her first acts as the monarch was to establish the English Protestant Church, breaking away from the Catholic Church and the Pope's authority. This move was the driving force behind the eventual ban on religious plays in England. In 1558, Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays as part of her efforts to diminish the influence of the Catholic Church and promote Protestantism. This led to the decline and eventual silencing of the great cycle plays by the 1580s. The banning of religious plays in England had a significant impact on the international theatre scene, destroying the connections that had previously existed between various European countries and their shared theatrical traditions. This disconnection between countries forced each nation to develop its own distinct form of drama, drawing upon their unique histories, cultural influences, and contemporary issues. The abandonment of religious plays allowed playwrights to explore secular subjects, which aligned with the growing interest in reviving Greek and Roman theatre, providing a perfect opportunity for dramatists to diversify their work. A result of these changes in the theatrical landscape was an increase in the production of histories, tragedies, and comedies, inspired by the works of ancient Greek and Roman playwrights such as Sophocles, Euripides, and Plautus. Playwrights like Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare began to flourish during the Elizabethan era, creating some of the most iconic and enduring dramas in English literature. Their plays dealt with themes of politics, love, and human nature, which resonated with the audience and broke away from the religious focus of medieval drama. Ultimately, the ruler in 1558 was Queen Elizabeth I, whose actions played a crucial role in the dissolution of medieval drama and the emergence of a new era in English theatre. Through her break from the Catholic Church, the banning of religious plays, and the subsequent shift in focus to secular subjects and classical influences, Elizabeth I enabled playwrights to reinvent and develop what would become the foundation of modern English drama."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: tight yo Review: dang what can i say, this album iz off tha hook.

If you owe someone 1197 candies and 158 candies more, you would owe them 1355 candies, so we have: 336 = -89q - 1355 3. To get the \\"q\\" alone, we need to move the -1355 to the other side. We do this by adding 1355 to both sides (because -1355 + 1355 = 0). So we will have: 336 + 1355 = -89q When you have 336 candies and get 1355 more, you have 1691 candies. So now, we have: 1691 = -89q 4. Now, we need to get \\"q\\" alone. To do that, we will divide both sides by -89 (since -89 times q = -89q): 1691 ÷ -89 = q 5.

Question: suppose a person is starving happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"B: Less waste being removed from the body. When a person is starving, it means that their body is not receiving enough nutrients and energy from food. As a result, the body is forced to rely on its energy reserves, such as stored fat and glycogen, to maintain vital functions like respiration, circulation, and overall metabolism. During this process, the production of waste products can be affected in different ways. First, let's understand the types of waste products that are removed from the body. These mainly include nitrogenous wastes like urea and ammonia, which are produced as a result of protein metabolism. Additionally, salts, metabolic waste products, and excess water are removed through the urinary system. In a starving person, three primary factors influence the reduced waste removal from the body: 1. Decreased protein intake: A starving individual consumes less protein, leading to a lower rate of protein metabolism. This decreased metabolism results in reduced formation of nitrogenous wastes like urea and ammonia, meaning there will be less waste to remove. 2. Energy conservation: When starving, the body tries to conserve energy and prioritize essential life-sustaining processes. The digestive and renal systems, though important, may not work as optimally as when the body receives sufficient nourishment. Consequently, the body may not process and remove waste products as efficiently as it would under normal conditions. 3. Catabolism of body tissues: In a prolonged state of starvation, the body begins to break down its own protein-containing tissues, such as muscles, to provide energy. This process increases the production of nitrogenous wastes. However, due to the lack of nutrients and impaired renal function, the body's ability to remove these waste products effectively is compromised. This results in the accumulation of waste products in the blood, which can lead to further health complications. In summary, during starvation, the overall waste removal process is less efficient and less waste is removed due to decreased protein metabolism, energy conservation, and impaired renal function."},{"question":"Originally, legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia Regis, or Royal Council, in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament. The so-called Model Parliament included bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members. In 1265, the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation. The body eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the House of Lords, while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons. The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law. During Henry VI's reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the sovereign's assent was obtained, as the sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Hence, all acts include the clause \\"Be it enacted by the Queen's (King's) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...\\". The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): The Modern Parliament included whom?","response":"The modern Parliament, also known as the Model Parliament, included various members representing different sections of society and interests. These members were: 1. Bishops: Senior members of the Church who played an important role in the legislative process due to their spiritual and religious influence. 2. Abbots: Heads of religious institutions such as monasteries, who were also involved in shaping legislation and policies. 3. Earls: High-ranking nobles who held significant political power and influence in their respective regions. They played a crucial role in advising the sovereign. 4. Barons: Lesser nobles who held land and political influence within their territories. They were also an important part of the advisory system to the King. 5. Two knights from each shire: These were representatives of their respective counties who participated in the legislative process to address regional concerns and protect their interests. 6. Two burgesses from each borough: Representatives of towns and urban areas, these individuals were involved in Parliament to ensure that the interests and concerns of the urban population were heard and addressed. These members were divided into two branches – the House of Lords, comprising the bishops, abbots, earls, and barons; and the House of Commons, consisting of the shire knights and borough burgesses.

Yellow object vs. ball: The original sentence specifically mentions a \\"yellow object\\" being thrown in the air, while the second statement refers to a \\"ball.\\" Although it is possible that the yellow object is a ball, the original sentence does not explicitly state this. It could also be a frisbee, a toy, or any other throwable object. 2. At the beach vs. standing on sand: The initial sentence states that the person is \\"standing on sand,\\" which is a common characteristic of a beach. However, the presence of sand does not necessarily mean that the scene takes place at a beach. It could be a sandbox, a desert, or any sandy location. The second statement explicitly mentions \\"at the beach,\\" which seems to be a likely scenario but is not confirmed in the original sentence. In summary, although the two statements describe similar situations, they are not exactly the same due to the unidentified nature of the yellow object and the unconfirmed location.

Understanding the purpose will help you choose the right material and mesh size. Step 2: Choose the material Select an appropriate material for the net. Common materials include nylon, cotton, and polypropylene. The chosen material should suit the purpose of the net, be durable, and resistant to the environment in which it will be used. Step 3: Choose the mesh size The mesh size determines the size of the objects that will be filtered through the net. Smaller mesh sizes will catch smaller objects but may require more force or time to filter. A larger mesh size may allow water to pass through more quickly, but may not catch smaller objects as effectively. Step 4: Cut the material Measure and cut a rectangular piece of the chosen material to the desired dimensions. The size depends on the purpose and design of the filtering net. Step 5: Create a loop Fold the top edge of the material down, creating a loop that is large enough to accommodate the support rod or rope, and sew it into place to create a pocket. Step 6: Seal the sides Sew or use adhesive along the remaining sides, leaving the looped end open. Step 7: Attach a support rod or rope Insert a support rod or rope through the loop created in step 5. This support will help keep the net open and rigid when filtering. Attach accessories like a handle or weights on either end as needed. Step 8: Secure the support rod or rope Tie the ends of the support rod or rope together to form a circle or a U shape, serving as a frame for the net. Step 9: Test and adjust Test the filtering net for strength and effectiveness before using it for its intended purpose. Adjust the design as needed to improve the performance of the net. Now you have a functional filtering net that can be used for the purpose you intended. Remember to maintain the net by cleaning it properly after use, and mending or replacing it when necessary, to ensure its longevity."},{"question":"Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The S.S.

In the afternoon he arrives in the small rural town of Hickory and enters the high school. He notices, on a shelf in the hall, basketball trophies won in previous years. As the bell rings to end the school day, he encounters teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). She realizes that Norman must be the new basketball coach and teacher of history and civics. She directs him to the office of principal Cletus Summers (Sheb Wooley), where the two men recall how they met many years ago at Buffalo State Teachers College. They had lost touch until recently, when Cletus tracked down Norman and asked him to come coach at Hickory. When Norman thanks Cletus for the opportunity, Cletus interrupts and says, \\"Your slate's clean here.\\" They proceed to the gym, where student Jimmy Chitwood (Maris Valainis) is shooting baskets. Cletus introduces Norman, but Jimmy ignores the new coach and keeps shooting.That evening on his farm, Cletus explains to Norman that Jimmy has been strongly affected by the recent death of the previous coach, who was like a father to Jimmy. Now the young man has withdrawn from almost everything and everyone and has decided not to play basketball this season. Cletus adds that Jimmy is the best player he has ever seen. As they finish talking, Norman cryptically mentions that he hopes things will work out for him this time.That night, Norman meets some of the townsmen in the barbershop, who bombard him with questions. He tells them he last coached 12 years ago, in Ithaca, New York, and that he has been in the Navy for the past 10 years. The men voice their opinions on what Norman should do with the team. They all agree that Jimmy must rejoin the Huskers for them to have a winning season.

However, after a recent development, they'll spend the rest of their years as a married couple.

Before the ceremony, the men expressed their excitement to Patch.com, stating they were \\"ecstatic beyond belief.\\" The journey to this point, however, was far from traditional.

The investment market focuses on the second-hand pieces, where examples of a Steinway grand typically start at about £10,000 and go up in price depending on the condition and the model. There are numerous other great makers, including the 'three Bs’ of Blüthner, Bechstein and Bösendorfer, as well as the early Steinway family offshoot Grotrian-Steinweg, plus the modern piano-maker Fazioli, that also attract investors who want a quality name but do not want to buy new. Although prices can start at under £1,000, cheaper pianos may be in need of expensive restoration. But from £2,000 upwards there is no reason why a piano with a good label cannot be purchased that will at least hold its value over time. Over the past decade, the prices of the most collectable grand pianos have doubled, thanks to an increase in demand – much of it coming from international musicians, particularly those in China. Grand pianos are the most collectable because they are the most rare and tend to offer superior acoustics – but, at 9ft in length, may not fit in your home. The so-called parlour or boudoir grand, which is typically between 5ft and 7ft long, may be more practical. However, a baby grand that is less than 5ft may not be such a shrewd investment. Reason says: “The so-called baby grand might compromise on sound. If you do not have the space or budget for a full-size grand then consider a top-quality upright piano. An upright with an overstrung iron frame can also provide better acoustics than a baby grand piano, as the strings in this instrument tend to be of greater length.” Piano Auctions holds four sales a year, with the next being on April 11 at the Conway Hall in Holborn, London. Among the top pieces being offered is a restored 9ft Steinway concert grand from the Twenties, finished in rosewood, with an estimate of £55,000. In a sale held last December, another 9ft Steinway grand made in 1925 cased in mahogany sold for £16,500. In the same sale a 1950 Steinway upright in mahogany sold for £3,400 – less than half the £7,000 estimate. Reason says: “Big price differences are due to a lot of factors – it is far more than just about the make and model. Many believe the Twenties were a heyday for piano-makers but, over time, unless the instrument has been well looked after, the piano can easily have fallen into disrepair.” In the December sale, a 9ft 2in concert grand made by Fazioli in 2007 went for £34,000, while a 6ft 3in Blüthner, also made in 2007, sold for £11,500. At the bargain end, a late-19th-century Bechstein upright valued at £1,500 sold for £200. Simon Hablin, a technician at piano restoration specialist Courtney Pianos in Oxford, says: “Condition is key. But before you throw out your old piano because it sounds out of tune, check with a specialist – not being a well-known name does not mean it can’t be valuable. It is vital for both buyers and sellers to get expert independent valuations.” Hablin explains that the passage of time – and central heating – can warp the wood and metal of many pianos. He says a basic restoration of the actions, hammers and re-felting might cost £1,500, so it can be cheaper to buy a piano with pedigree rather than fixing a relatively worthless old model. “If you want to keep a strong value you should treat it like a classic car and try to get it restored to its former glory. But an old Victorian piano can also be in better shape than a badly made modern instrument – in 100 years, the design of the piano has hardly changed,” he says. Hablin explains that the piano should be treated as an attractive piece of furniture as well as a musical instrument. The cost of a complete French polish restoration might add £2,000 to the bill, but this cost should be more than recouped in the investment appeal it can bring. Special commissioned “art case” or Art Deco pianos are particularly sought after by piano investors, with unique craftsmanship commanding a premium. “A popular modern piano is the Yamaha, but it is important to realise some cheaper models are often put together with synthetic glues and made of veneer rather than solid wood – they can be great-value instruments but cannot be renovated the same way,” adds Hablin. He warns against electronic pianos as an investment, as instruments that might have cost £2,000 new can soon plummet in value when they are overtaken by later innovations. The pianoforte - meaning “soft-loud” – was invented in 1709 by the Italian Bartolomeo Cristofori after he tinkered with a harpsichord to give it hammer volume control. Only three examples of a Cristofori survive today and these are now priceless artefacts. In the Twenties and Thirties many households had a stand-up piano as the centre of family singalongs. The piano hit its lowest note in the Sixties when many thousands were destroyed during “piano-smashing” charity events. In more recent years, the survivors have had to fight it out with modern quality pianos made by the likes of Yamaha that can provide great acoustics for reasonable prices – as well as the hi-tech electronic versions. The Yamaha is a favourite among piano teachers for its consistent good quality, and if looked after should maintain its value. Decent U1 and U3 uprights can be picked up for less than £2,000 – though you can pay more for reconditioned models. A professional piano tuner should be used to check out any potential purchase to save you from making a big mistake at auction or in a private sale. It is also good to involve the family when making any purchase. Aesthetics are important, but if you want children to enjoy the piano, let them join in the shopping. Buying a classic piano should be a fun and rewarding experience. You need to consider the cost of looking after the instrument, too. The piano should be tuned once every six months and this costs at least £50. Central heating can do permanent damage to piano wood so be wary of keeping the investment too close to a radiator, or in a room with under-floor heating. Although a piano should benefit from use – providing joy to musicians and listeners – there is no reason why it should not be seen as a beautiful piece of furniture that might appreciate in value. Provenance can also play a role in the value of a piano – especially if someone famous once owned it. Unfortunately, even the finest heritage is unlikely to improve the skills of a pianist – though the quality of the note may sound better. You will still have to keep taking those piano lessons. Five famous pianos that have soared in value A 1970 Steinway 'Model Z’ upright used by John Lennon to compose Imagine in 1971 was sold at auction for £1.67 million – £1.45 million plus commission – to George Michael in October 2000. The former Beatle also recorded the single on this piano. A piano used by the actor Dooley Wilson as Sam in the 1942 movie Casablanca sold for £370,000 at a Sotheby’s auction in December 2012. Humphrey Bogart – who played Rick – actually said: 'Play it, Sam’, referring to As Time Goes By, and not: 'Play it again, Sam.’ The piano was a Warner Brothers prop with 58 keys – 30 less than on a conventional instrument. A piano used by Paul McCartney for the first rendition of Yesterday sold for £150,000 in April 2011. The 1926 green Eavestaff mini-piano was owned by a friend, the singer Alma Cogan. The Beatle had dreamt of the melody the previous night while in bed and went round to her house in 1964, fearing it might have been an existing melody. A white 1910 “A-Day Birdcage” upright, used by Elton John in the early Seventies to compose in collaboration with Bernie Taupin, sold at auction for £91,000 in 2004. He used it to play classic pieces such as Your Song.

A brand called Steinway is really popular, but brand new pianos can be very pricey. Instead, people look at second-hand pianos that are a bit cheaper. Over the years, the prices of some old grand pianos have gone up a lot because people really want them. These grand pianos look and sound really nice, but they are very big, so they might not fit in someone's house. When you want to buy a piano, it is important to check if it is in good condition. Sometimes old pianos can be worth fixing up if they have a good brand name, but other times it is better to buy a newer one instead.

Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Make this lower case","response":"when cortez went into central america for two years, those he left in charge confiscated his properties. Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador, initiated the conquest of the Aztec Empire in the early 16th century, resulting in a profound alteration of the political and social landscape in Central America. During his two-year absence from the region, however, individuals he had entrusted to oversee his affairs chose to seize his properties, leading to significant changes in his personal holdings and possessions. Prior to departing, Cortés established specific individuals who were to act as overseers and protectors of his valuable properties. These individuals, typically comprised of faithful officials or trusted partners, played a crucial role in managing Cortés' land and possessions in his stead. However, the political climate in Central America during the early 16th century was rife with intrigue and power struggles, providing a ripe environment for opportunistic individuals to act in their own best interests. While Cortés was engaged in the conquest of Central America, the individuals he left in charge began confiscating his properties for various reasons. Some may have been motivated by personal greed, seeking to increase their own wealth and power by taking possession of Cortés' valuable holdings. Others might have seen Cortés' absence as an opportunity to undermine his authority, believing that by weakening his economic position, they could gain leverage against him in the chaotic world of Spanish politics. Regardless of their individual motivations, those entrusted to safeguard Cortés' properties ultimately chose to betray their responsibility, leaving the conquistador with a vastly diminished land base and financial resources upon his return. This betrayal would have undoubtedly been a severe blow to Cortés, as the loss of his properties would have hampered his ability to finance future expeditions and effectively eroded his influence. Cortés' experience underlines the complexities and dangers inherent in the era of exploration and conquest. It illustrates the need for a leader to continually balance the pursuit of new territories and wealth against the desire to maintain and protect existing assets. For Hernán Cortés, the confiscation of his properties during his two-year absence marked a significant setback in his ultimate quest for control and wealth in Central America."},{"question":"Nation needs government help to maintain competitive edge, group says.

Stephan took guest appearance in Satyricon 's album Megiddo . - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz. - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - VNV Nation is an English/Irish electronic music band originally from Dublin and Essex and now based in Hamburg, Germany. They combine elements of synthpop, trance and electronic body music (EBM). The members are Ronan Harris and Mark Jackson. The \\"VNV\\" in the name stands for \\"Victory Not Vengeance\\", in keeping with the group's motto, \\"One should strive to achieve, not sit in bitter regret.\\" - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Icon of Coil is a Norwegian electronic music band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live.

The group's debut, \\"Phosphor\\", came out in 2000. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Sarpsborg , historically Borg, is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg. - Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993.

In 1995 the follow-up album \\"Concrete Ground\\" was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album \\"Nightfall\\" was published featuring the club-filler \\"Im Innern Einer Frau\\". - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\". - Hans Christian Andersen (often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; (2 April 1805 4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called in Danish, express themes that transcend age and nationality. - Apoptygma Berzerk (commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian musical group. They have achieved success with a brand of synthpop, and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene and referring to themselves as \\"futurepop\\".

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of post-industrial music and electropunk.

(Evasive Beats) is a story set in the near future where technology has advanced far beyond what people once thought possible. The protagonist, E.B., short for Evasive Beats, is a skilled martial artist and undercover operative who has been implanted with an intuitive AI system that gives them great combat capabilities, including the ability to predict the movement of enemies and dodge attacks with incredible precision. The film starts with E.B., a highly trained operative, being assigned to a covert mission to infiltrate and dismantle a dangerous and powerful criminal organization, known as The Blades. This organization has recently acquired a mass production facility for advanced weaponry, threatening global peace and stability. The weapons of choice for The Blades are life-threatening, intelligent, and self-guided blades that inflict brutal damage on their victims. E.B.'s main task is to locate the factory, bring down its operations, and capture the leader of The Blades, Victor Helix, an infamous figure in the criminal underworld. Joined by a highly skilled team of agents, E.B. embarks on a treacherous journey through a dystopian city filled with incredibly skilled adversaries and deadly traps. Throughout the film, E.B. faces numerous deadly encounters with members of The Blades and its array of lethal machines, including battles with the powerful and highly skilled henchmen of Victor Helix. In these high-octane scenes, E.B. relies on the evasive beats - the predictive AI system implanted within them - to avoid the lethal attacks of The Blades. But the plot takes a twist when E.B. discovers that Victor Helix has anticipated their arrival and is tracking E.B.'s every move, including the team's extraction plans. Now trapped in the city, E.B. and the team not only have to face Victor's henchmen but must also dodge city surveillance and military police forces sent to eliminate them. As the story unfolds, E.B. slowly learns that the intuitive AI system within them not only helps them evade their enemies but also lays down some hidden talents that they had not previously known - such as an ability to connect with and manipulate cutting-edge technology. Relying on this newfound power, E.B. takes on a daring and seemingly impossible plan to take down the entire organization. Along with the help of his team, E.B. successfully infiltrates the factory, shutting down the production line, and ultimately confronts Victor Helix in a climactic showdown combining martial arts combat, state-of-the-art weapons, and lightning-fast dodging skills.

She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes. answer the following question: Where does the original owner of the weaving company live?

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

If you've tried everything, you can try replacing your hard drive as a last-ditch effort. If you iPod is making a clicking sound and the \\"sad iPod\\" image appears on your screen, then the hard drive most likely needs to be replaced. Replacement hard drives can be ordered online, or you can scavenge a drive out of another iPod that is the same model. All versions of the iPod Touch, iPod Shuffle, and iPod Nano use flash memory instead of a traditional hard drive. This means there are no moving parts that can fail or connections that can become severed. There is no practical way to secure or replace an iPod Touch hard drive, as the flash memory unit is built into the circuitry. Make sure that the iPod is turned off and locked with the Hold switch toggled on before opening your iPod. This will ensure that you don't accidentally turn it on while working on it. Follow the steps in the previous method to remove the back from your iPod to expose the hard drive. Lift the hard drive from the top of the iPod. Don't try to pull it out completely. Remove the rubber bumpers and shock absorber and set them to the side. You will see a cable at the bottom the drive that attaches the drive to the circuitry. Gently work the cable out of the drive, using either your fingers or a screwdriver. Once the cable has been detached, you should be able to completely remove the drive from the housing. Once you have pulled the drive out, take off the foam cover and put it on your replacement drive. Put the rubber shock absorbers on it as well. Insert the new drive in the same direction that the old drive was installed. Gently insert the cable so that the hard drive can send and receive data from the iPod's motherboard. Close up the iPod and ensure that all of the tabs click. With the new hard drive installed, all that is left is to perform a restore on the iPod.

Justin didn't have the strength to lift the bricks unlike Kevin because","response":"Justin had always been a bit of a scrawny kid. Where Kevin was muscular and confident, Justin was slim and shy. This made it difficult for Justin to compete against his brother, Kevin, when it came to physical tasks. Growing up together, the two had always been compared by their parents, teachers, and friends. Justin couldn't help but feel inadequate in the shadow of his determined and strong brother. However, as they got older, their differences took them along separate paths in life. Kevin went on to become a star athlete in their small town, his well-toned physique earning him praise and attention from everyone, whether on the football field or the local construction site. His natural ability to perform physically demanding tasks landed him a job with the prominent local construction company. Everyone agreed that Kevin was truly a force to be reckoned with. Meanwhile, what Justin lacked in physical strength, he made up for in his creativity and intellect. Passionate about science and engineering, he delved deep into his studies, earning top grades and recognition from his professors. Though Justin was well-aware of his physical limitations, he channeled his energy into inventing devices and gadgets that would give him the opportunity to keep up with his brother. Justin's devices were as awe-inspiring as they were ingenious – from the robotic exoskeleton that allowed him to assist on construction sites to the remote-controlled drones that he used to help rescue trapped workers in collapsed buildings. Still, whenever he was around Kevin, Justin couldn't escape that nagging feeling that he was the lesser sibling, somehow inferior in the eyes of others. One day, as Justin was walking home from school, he stumbled across a group of kids who were struggling to build a makeshift fort out of bricks in a nearby alley. He watched in fascination as the children strained to lift the heavy stones in their small arms but couldn't budge them. Justin spotted Kevin driving past in his truck. The temptation was too great to resist. He had to find a way to construct a stronger and more efficient device that would allow him to demonstrate his own capabilities, particularly in front of his brother. As Justin hurried home, an idea struck him. What if he could devise a kinetic power enhancer that would harness and amplify his own limited strength? This way, he could lift the bricks with ease and help the kids complete their fort. Over the following weeks, Justin toiled away in his makeshift workshop, feverishly working on the blueprint for his new invention. Chronicling every gear, lever, and switch, he spent hours tinkering and building his power-enhancing masterpiece. The day finally arrived, and Justin proudly unveiled his KinetiX-3000, to the amazement of the children gathered around. As he strapped the device to his arms and legs, he could feel the surge of newfound power coursing through him. Justin marveled in delight as he effortlessly lifted a brick and then another, each seemingly weightless in his hands. It was undeniably impressive, a testament to his ingenuity and determination. As he built the children's fort, word began to spread, and the crowd grew. Even Kevin, who was driving by again, stopped to see what all the commotion was about. The sight of his little brother handling bricks with super-human strength surprised him, but it also filled Kevin with profound respect for Justin. Kevin told his brother, now more than impressed, \\"You may not have the muscles, but you've got something much stronger: your brain.\\" Justin understood that what made him different from Kevin didn't have to be a burden, but what truly defined him and contributed to their community. Lifting bricks might have been a small act, but it was a monumental victory for both brothers – a moment of realization that strength comes in many forms, and each person's unique abilities can be celebrated. From that day on, Justin and Kevin no longer compared themselves to each other. Instead, they embraced each other's strengths, working together as siblings and supporting one another in their common goal of improving the lives of the people in their town. The brothers had finally formed an unbreakable bond, built not on bricks, but on love, respect, and understanding."},{"question":"Complete text: annie asked , her mind split between buford sweeney 's possible reasons against the idea and the sight of a blonde-headed woman sitting inside clem 's trailer . annie strained to see through the dirty , sliding glass doors of the trailer . \`\` i think it 's because he 's too cheap to pay for the service , but momma does n't care . she wants clem out .

This condition can cause a tendency toward prolonged or excessive bleeding ( bleeding diathesis or bleeding disorder ) , which may occur spontaneously or following an injury or medical and dental procedures . - In medicine (hematology), bleeding diathesis (h(a)emorrhagic diathesis) is an unusual susceptibility to bleed (hemorrhage) mostly due to hypocoagulability, in turn caused by a coagulopathy (a defect in the system of coagulation). Several types are distinguished, ranging from mild to lethal. Also, bleeding diathesis can be caused by thinning of the skin or impaired wound healing. - Hematology, also spelled haematology (from the Greek , \\"haima\\" \\"blood,\\" and -o), is the branch of medicine concerned with the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. Hematology includes the study of etiology. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots, other bleeding disorders and blood cancers such as leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. Many hematologists work as hematologist-oncologists, also providing medical treatment for all types of cancer. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.

In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\". The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\". Boydell spared no expense. He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.

Southern states like Virginia had deeply entrenched views on race and slavery, which might have shaped Wilson's perception of race relations. Step 3: Consider Wilson's actions as president During his presidency, Wilson implemented discriminatory policies that had significant impact on Black people. Here are a couple of examples: - He allowed his cabinet members to segregate federal offices, leading to the segregation of workspaces and even restrooms. - He refused to endorse the 19th Amendment, which granted Black people the right to vote. He only came to support the amendment later, after it became a politically mainstream idea. Step 4: Evaluating his personal views Wilson supported the idea of a \\"racial hierarchy\\" and believed that Black people were inferior to white people. This belief has been documented through his writings and public statements. For example, he described the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist group, as a \\"veritable empire of the South\\" in his book \\"A History of the American People.\\" Step 5: Conclusion Based on the evidence from his policies, personal behaviors, and writings, it is reasonable to conclude that Woodrow Wilson did not consider Black people to be equal members of society. His opinions and actions demonstrated a belief in white supremacy and a willingness to maintain racial inequality within the United States."},{"question":"In the wee hours yesterday morning, promoter Don King stood at a podium inside Madison Square Garden and -- in the midst of a bombastic assault on his What is this text about?","response":"This text is about an event that happened yesterday morning.

Movie title: Love Exposure Movie plot: Chapter 1: YuYu Honda, a young teenage Catholic is attempting to live his life in a faithful and orderly manner. Before his mother dies, she makes him promise that he will marry a woman as beautiful as The Virgin Mary. His father, Tetsu, becomes a devout Catholic priest following the death of Yu's mother, and operates his own church. As he grows up, Yu comes to realise that only marrying Mary will suit him, and goes on his search for Mary. A woman named Kaori becomes obsessed with Tetsu, and forces her love on him, which he eventually reciprocates. Together, the three move into a new house where their relationship is kept a secret. Tired of this secrecy, Kaori leaves the house, which leaves Tetsu broken and depressed. He makes Yu come to confessional every day, and demands to know his sins. Yu, unable to think of any sins he might have committed, lies, but is caught. He decides to deliberately commit sins and confess them to his father.Tetsu becomes displeased with this, and moves to his church, almost disowning Yu as his son. Yu falls in with a gang of three delinquent boys named Takahiro, Yuji and Senpai, who teach him to steal, fight and live on the streets, amused by his need to commit sins only to confess them to his father. They suggest he try something more provocative, which a Catholic priest would not tolerate, and take him to a man named Llyod, who specialises in a \\"kung fu\\" technique of taking voyeuristic \\"panty shot\\" photos of girls in public. After great training, Yu becomes an expert himself at taking \\"panty shot\\" photos, but unlike others, does not do it for perverted reasons, but simply out of a need to commit sins. When he confesses his activities to his father, Tetsu beats him as a father would beat his son, which pleases Yu. He refuses to take Yu's confession, and throws him out of the church, where Yu piously prays to God even in the rain.A gang of three girls, led by Koike pass him and he photographs them, but is caught. Koike however, lets him go, amused about his situation. Yu's friends... The answer to this question is:","response":"After losing a bet, Yu dresses up as a woman. In the movie \\"Love Exposure,\\" Yu's friends dare him to dress like a woman and then take \\"panty shot\\" photographs in public.

This act plays a crucial role in the storyline, as it leads to important encounters and further developments in the plot. It adds a layer of complexity to Yu's character and his struggle between his devotion to the Catholic faith and his desire to commit sins in an attempt to reconnect with his father."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a scientific question, generate an incorrect answer to the given question.

Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain mountains south of the Willamette Valley; the Willamette River and its tributaries drain north along the Willamette Valley into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon. answer the following question: What percentage of the Rogue River is Wild and Scenic?

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

The Moors had talents that Jaume I used and profited from on Mallorca after converting them to Christianity. 3.

Question 2: How do you tell if someone is online in Instagram? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Yes, the answer to both of these questions would be the same, as they essentially ask about the same concept: identifying whether someone is online on Instagram. To know if someone is online on Instagram, there are a few methods you can try: 1. Activity status in Direct Messages: In the Direct Messages section, you can see the activity status of the people you have previously conversed with. To do so, open the DM section by tapping the paper plane icon at the top right corner of your Instagram app. If someone is active, you will see a green dot beside their name, which indicates that they are currently online. In addition, it may show \\"Active Now\\" or \\"Active x minutes/hours ago\\" under their name, giving you an idea of when they were last online. However, these indicators may not always be accurate or available, as users have the option to disable their activity status in the app settings. 2. Check Instagram Stories: Another way to determine if someone is online is by keeping an eye on their Instagram stories. If a user has recently uploaded a story or updated one, there is a higher chance that they are currently online or have recently been active. This method isn't foolproof, as someone might be online without updating their story, but it can give you some insight into their recent activity. 3. Instagram Live: When users start a live video or join a live video as a viewer, their followers receive a notification. If you happen to see someone going live or joining live videos, this is a clear indication that they are online. Note that this method is dependent on your notification settings and whether the user is actively engaging in Instagram Live sessions. 4. Comments and Likes on posts: Monitoring engagement on posts is another way to guess if someone is online. If you notice that a user has recently commented on or liked a post, it might indicate that they are currently active on the platform. Keep in mind that the timing of a like or comment may not be visible to you, and this method relies on you being online at the same time as the person of interest.

Feds formally charged Shahzad with five terror-related counts late in a day when details about him came fast and furious. The biggest: His own claim that he trained to make bombs in a lawless region of Pakistan ruled by the Taliban. Still, the feds made no mention of links to al-Qaeda in the charges, notes AP. Other developments: The Connecticut Post and New York Times dug through trash outside Shahzad's Bridgeport home and found a cache of personal documents that fill in details about his 11-year stay in the US. Pakistan made multiple arrests of people suspected to be involved, reports Reuters. Expand this summary.","response":"Faisal Shahzad, the individual responsible for the attempted terror attack in Times Square, will not be appearing in court today as previously scheduled. It is also uncertain if he will appear tomorrow since he has been providing a considerable amount of information to investigators regarding his alleged terror plot. Shahzad has been formally charged with five terror-related counts, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted act of terrorism transcending national boundaries. These charges come after the suspect allegedly admitted to training in bomb-making techniques in the lawless region of Waziristan, Pakistan, an area known to be under the control of the Taliban. The region has long been a hotbed for militant activity, including training and recruiting for various terrorist organizations. Despite Shahzad's claims of connections to the Taliban, the federal authorities have not yet mentioned any links to al-Qaeda in the official charges. This could potentially indicate that the investigators are still working on establishing connections. In related news, local newspapers such as the Connecticut Post and the New York Times have been conducting their own investigations into Shahzad's life in the United States. The journalists scoured through trash outside his Bridgeport home, where they discovered a trove of personal documents that revealed more about his 11-year stay in the US, including details regarding his work history, financial status, and educational background. These documents are crucial in helping the authorities understand Shahzad's motivations and connections. Meanwhile, the Pakistani government has also been making progress in its investigations, reportedly arresting multiple individuals suspected of being involved in the terror plot. The cooperation between the US and Pakistani authorities is vital in uncovering more details about the attack and the potential involvement of terrorist groups. As the investigation proceeds, it is crucial for the authorities to carefully analyze all the information provided by Shahzad and the evidence collected through various sources. This will help in understanding the bigger picture of the terror plot and the extent of its international connections. Additionally, investigating Shahzad's personal motivations and circumstances could provide insight into how terrorists are radicalized and recruited and help prevent future attacks. In conclusion, the arrest and interrogation of Faisal Shahzad have led to significant developments in the investigation into the attempted Times Square attack. With multiple terror-related charges against him and his own claims of training in Pakistan, the probe into the extent of his connections and potential involvement in larger terror networks is of utmost importance. The cooperation between the US and Pakistan, as well as the efforts made by local journalists to uncover details about Shahzad's life, all contribute to the understanding of this complex case and the ongoing battle against terrorism."},{"question":"Question: \\"Maybe we're being too harsh with the letter,\\" said Janine. \\"Hon, as his parents we have a responsibility to his well being,\\" said Bob. \\"I know but I just think he doesn't need this added pressure.\\" \\"Jan, I'll be damned if I'm gonna support and house a drug addict.\\" \\"I just think maybe he's going through tough times or something.

The controversy started after an appearance on Fox's Outnumbered, when the outspoken conservative said the school's recent ban on sorority members attending frat events was unfair to 'good girls' when it's the 'bad girls -- bad women -- or the ones who like to be naughty, [who] might go out and play and get hurt.' 'But the other thing about this is that it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over-drinks. It's the same thing with guns. Guns don't kill people; people kill people,' she continued. Apologized: Clueless actress turned Fox News contributor Stacey Dash issued an apology this week following comments she made regarding the issue of rape at UVA that many saw as unabashed victim blaming. Critics quickly pounced and said the 48-year-old's comments excused sexual assaults on 'bad girls' who choose to drink alcohol. And on Monday, Dash responded by clarifying what she meant via a Facebook post in which she called her 'naughty girl' comments 'a failed attempt at humor.' Dash continued:. 'LET ME BE CLEAR: I am a victim of physical and sexual abuse. My point was that there IS NO EXCUSE for a man taking advantage of women under any circumstances. 'I believe that these universities focusing on alcohol consumption as a means to stop evil behavior takes the focus off the real issue of the objectification of women and how that can be prevented. Dash apologized via Facebook, where she called herself a victim of assault. 'I apologize to anyone who believed I was blaming the victims of these horrible acts.' While the response was enough to quiet most critics, at least one found the apology offensive in its own right. In her article titled 'Look, Stacey Dash, We Thought You Were Victim-Blaming Sexual Assault Survivors Because You Were Victim-Blaming Them', Kirsten West Savali of The Root wrote:. 'If Dash had said that the ban was \\"ridiculous\\" because it disempowers women, that would have been a more solid argument.

He was a grandson of Ernest, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, who was regent of the Principality of Lippe until 1904. He was also a nephew of the principality's last sovereign Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe. Bernhard met then-Princess Juliana at the 1936 Winter Olympics at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Juliana's mother, Queen Wilhelmina, had spent most of the 1930s looking for a suitable husband for Juliana. As a Protestant of royal rank (the Lippe-Biesterfelds were a sovereign house in the German Empire), Bernhard was acceptable for the devoutly religious Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina left nothing to chance, and had her lawyers draft a very detailed prenuptial agreement that specified exactly what Bernhard could and could not do. The couple's engagement was announced on 8 September 1936, and they were married at The Hague on 7 January 1937. Earlier, Bernhard had been granted Dutch citizenship, and changed the spelling of his names from German to Dutch. Previously styled as Serene Highness, he became a Royal Highness by Dutch Law. His appropriateness as consort of the future Queen would later become a matter of some public debate. Prince Bernhard was father of six children, four of them with Queen Juliana. The eldest daughter is Princess Beatrix, former Queen of the Netherlands, (1938). His other daughters with Juliana are Irene (1939), Margriet (1943) and Christina (1947). He had two illegitimate daughters. The first is Alicia von Bielefeld (born 21 June 1952), whose mother has not been identified. She is a landscape architect and lives in the United States. Prince Bernhard's sixth daughter, Alexia Grinda (a.k.a. Alexia Lejeune or Alexia Grinda-Lejeune, born in Paris on 10 July 1967), is his child by the French socialite and fashion model Helene Grinda. Although rumours about these two children had already spread, it was made official after his death. In December 2008, Dutch historian Cees Fasseur claimed that former British Conservative Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken was the result of a wartime affair between Prince Bernhard and Aitken's mother, previously Penelope Maffey. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Who was he married to?","response":"Prince Bernhard was married to Princess Juliana, as stated in the text: \\"The couple's engagement was announced on 8 September 1936, and they were married at The Hague on 7 January 1937.\\""},{"question":"Please answer the following question: \\"Shallcross (Anchorage Kentucky)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

After a Steelers three-and-out, on the Patriots first offensive play, Brady hit Chris Hogan for a 12-yard gain, but Hogan was stripped by Jarvis Jones, who recovered the ball at the Patriots 45. The Steelers drove to the Patriots 16, but on 3rd-and-6, Landry Jones was intercepted in the end zone by Malcolm Butler on a pass intended for Antonio Brown. Taking over at their own 20, the Patriots went on an 80-yard marathon, taking 13 plays, with Brady finding James White on a 19-yard touchdown pass. After the Steelers went three-and-out again, the Patriots marched 84 more yards, scoring on Blount's 3-yard touchdown four minutes into the second quarter, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. The Steelers countered on their next drive. Aided by Brown's 51-yard catch, they trimmed the score to 14-7 on a 14-yard touchdown catch by Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a Patriot three-and-out, a bad punt by Ryan Allen gave the Steelers the ball at the Steelers 47. Six plays later, Jones hit Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for a holding penalty on Chris Hubbard. On the next play Jones threw an incompletion and Chris Boswell missed a 42-yard field goal. The Patriots reached midfield on their next drive, but were forced to punt. Allen pinned the Steelers at their own 6, but the Steelers challenged that the ball hit the end zone, and the ruling was reversed giving the Steelers the ball at the 20. With the better field position, the Steelers drove 66 yards to the Patriots 14, and Boswell was good from 32 yards and the score was 14-10 Patriots at halftime. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 28 and Boswell made a 46-yard field goal, trimming the score to just 14-13.

Context: President Donald Trump often likes to point out how different he is from his White House predecessors in terms of style and substance. But it is unlikely any past president would envy the legal challenges facing Trump, from the Russia investigation to Stormy Daniels to the scrutiny law enforcement is giving his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner. The two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings. The only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen. \\"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl. After a pause, the president responded. \\"Stupid question,\\" he said dismissively. Cohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied. Trump has frequently complained about the recent FBI raids on Cohen's home and office and the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier this month Trump spoke up during a meeting with military officials at the White House. \\"Here we are talking about Syria, we are talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.\\" Several legal analysts have said the increased scrutiny of Trump's long relationship with Cohen could become a serious problem for the president. \\"There has been no suggestions that Cohen has nothing that he could say, which suggests that they know that Cohen actually does possess information that could be damaging to Trump or the Trump organization more generally as a legal matter,\\" said George Washington University Law...

In which sample less rocks would have chemical reactions, sample A or sample B? Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. The answer to this question is:","response":"To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step by step: 1. We need to determine in which sample less rocks would have chemical reactions, sample A or sample B. 2. Sample A is from the Amazon Rainforest, which has one of the highest rainfalls in the world. 3. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, which has one of the lowest rainfalls in the world. 4. Rainfall influences the rate of weathering, and more rain means more rainwater passes through the soil. 5. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles, causing chemical reactions in the rocks. 6. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. 7. High rainfall may also carry material away, exposing new surfaces and increasing the rate of weathering. From the above information, we learn that higher rainfall leads to increased chemical reactions, and the Amazon Rainforest (sample A) has a higher rainfall than the Atacama Desert (sample B).

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly?

He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

While it is possible that the car was from a northern region where air conditioning might not be a necessity for the majority of the year, there are several other factors and possibilities to consider before reaching such a conclusion. 1. Age of the vehicle: Older vehicles may not have air conditioning systems, or the system might have been broken and not repaired due to the cost or lack of necessity in the previous location. 2. Make and model of the vehicle: Some vehicle models, especially budget or economy cars, might not have air conditioning as a standard feature to keep the overall cost of the vehicle low. 3. Personal preference or budget constraints: The previous owner of the vehicle may have opted not to have air conditioning due to personal preferences or budget limitations at the time of purchase. 4. Climate considerations: While it is true that northern regions generally have cooler climates and air conditioning may not be essential, there are also locations in the south or in other parts of the world with temperate climates where air conditioning might not be a priority. 5. Previous use of the vehicle: The car could have been used primarily in a professional setting, like a delivery or utility vehicle, where the comfort of the driver was not a primary concern. 6. Customization or after-market modifications: It is also possible that the car did originally have an air conditioning system, but it was removed or disconnected due to a previous owner's desire to save on fuel costs, reduce weight, or make other modifications to the vehicle. In summary, while it is possible that \\"the car was from the north,\\" it is not a definitive conclusion based solely on the absence of an air conditioner in the vehicle.

When comparing this number to 3,000, it is clear that the number of survivors from Yingxiu is smaller, with 2,300 survivors as opposed to the stated 3,000. The context goes on to discuss the devastating impact of the earthquake in various locations in Sichuan, detailing the massive losses in terms of human life, injuries, and destruction of buildings and infrastructure. The loss of life and property caused by the earthquake was indeed substantial and had significant consequences on the affected areas. In Beichuan County, Sichuan alone, it is mentioned that there were between 3,000 to 5,000 fatalities, with 10,000 people injured and 80% of the buildings destroyed.

Choose from: (a). no (b). yes","response":"In order to determine if KFC is halal, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Research KFC's food practices I will research KFC's food practices to understand whether they follow halal guidelines. This includes the sourcing of their chicken, the method of slaughtering and preparing the meat, and overall hygiene and cleanliness. Step 2: Explore regional differences Different countries may have varying halal standards and KFC restaurants may adapt to comply with local regulations. I will check if KFC meets the halal standards in various regions. Step 3: Check for certification I will check if KFC has any halal certification to confirm whether their chicken is halal or not. Halal certifying bodies can provide assurance that KFC follows the necessary guidelines. After conducting research, it is found that KFC is halal in some countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, where the company operates halal-certified branches. However, in other countries or regions, KFC may not necessarily be halal. It is important to check local KFC branches and their certification to confirm whether KFC's chicken is halal or not in a specific area. Now, let's analyze the two questions: 1. Is KFC Halal? 2. Is KFC chicken halal? Both questions ask whether KFC complies with halal rules, although the second question specifically focuses on the chicken itself. It can be assumed that if the chicken is halal, then the overall restaurant will be considered halal, given that chicken is their primary product. As both questions are aiming to determine the halal status of KFC, particularly its chicken, the questions can be considered the same. Therefore, the answer is: (b). yes"},{"question":"You are presented with the question \\"What are some viruses enclosed by? \\" and the following answer choices: - sub-units of species - phospholipids, fat, molecule - Germy surfaces - it keeps an organism warm - Something that comes in a bundle of fibers - Something made from fermented ricce - microorganisms - A compound that donates proton Now knowing that some viruses have an envelope of phospholipids and proteins and some viruses are also enclosed by an envelope of fat and protein molecules, choose the best answer.

Which boy and the girl embraced? Pick from: -- unacceptable; -- acceptable;","response":"The given sentence, \\"Which boy and the girl embraced?\\" is deemed unacceptable in terms of both syntactic and semantic acceptability. 1. Syntactic acceptability: From the standpoint of syntax, the sentence structure appears to be faulty. The phrase \\"Which boy and the girl\\" combines an interrogative determiner \\"which\\" with a definite article \\"the,\\" which is not a standard syntactic expression in English grammar. A more appropriate sentence would be one of the following: - Which boy embraced the girl? - The girl embraced which boy? 2. Semantic acceptability: Considering the semantic aspect, the sentence also lacks clarity in conveying a comprehensible message. The combination of \\"which boy and the girl\\" creates ambiguity regarding the subject of the sentence. It is unclear whether the question intends to ask which boy embraced the girl or if both the boy and the girl embraced someone or something else. The provided alternative sentences mentioned above would help in precisely conveying the intended message in a semantically acceptable manner. In conclusion, the given sentence \\"Which boy and the girl embraced?\\" is unacceptable in terms of syntactic and semantic acceptability. The alternative options, \\"Which boy embraced the girl?\\" or \\"The girl embraced which boy?\\" would be more acceptable choices for both syntactic and semantic aspects."},{"question":"Same meaning?

Both sentences describe the location of an unspecified area or place in relation to Altha, Blountstown, and the Apalachicola River. However, the order of the references to Altha and Blountstown is reversed in each sentence. Let's analyze each sentence separately: 1. It is located north of Altha and east of Blountstown on the west bank of the Apalachicola River. In this sentence, the main focus is on the location of the unspecified area or place being north of Altha. Then, it is further described as being east of Blountstown. Finally, the sentence specifies that it is on the west bank of the Apalachicola River. The sentence structure can be visualized like this: (North of Altha) --> (East of Blountstown) --> (West Bank of the Apalachicola River). 2. It is located to the north of Blountstown and east of Altha on the west bank of the Apalachicola River. In this sentence, the main focus is on the location of the unspecified area or place being north of Blountstown. Then, it is further described as being east of Altha. Similar to the first sentence, the west bank of the Apalachicola River is provided as the final geographical reference. The sentence structure can be visualized like this: (North of Blountstown) --> (East of Altha) --> (West Bank of the Apalachicola River). The only difference between the two sentences is the order in which Altha and Blountstown are mentioned. However, both sentences convey the same meaning about the location of the unspecified area or place.

Does it follow that \\"Durbar Marg Avenue is far from the palace.\\"?","response":"No, it does not follow that \\"Durbar Marg Avenue is far from the palace.\\" In fact, the statement \\"The palace stands at the head of the wide Durbar Marg Avenue leading south\\" indicates that the palace is located at the beginning of Durbar Marg Avenue. The term \\"head\\" suggests that the palace is at the starting point or entrance of the avenue, rather than being situated at a distance from it. Durbar Marg Avenue likely stretches southwards from the palace, with the palace serving as a prominent landmark or focal point at its northern end. The actual distance between the palace and various locations along Durbar Marg Avenue may vary, but it would be incorrect to assume that palace is far from the avenue as the entire avenue starts from the palace itself. In conclusion, Durbar Marg Avenue is not far from the palace but instead begins at the palace, with the palace acting as a central feature in the avenue's landscape."},{"question":"Information: - West Virginia is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States.

Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer.

Victoria English (portrayed by a capable and charismatic actress) is celebrating her recent victory in the Presidential election, becoming the first woman to hold the esteemed office on the new world. Despite the initial excitement of her historic win, Victoria quickly realizes that not everyone is supportive of her progressive ideals. As she takes office, she faces substantial challenges from both inside and outside her administration. However, her resilient and resourceful nature helps her gain the respect and trust of the skeptical populace. As she begins to enact meaningful policy changes, Victoria's popularity soars. Act 2: The Conspiracy Amidst the tales of her administration's accomplishments, a hidden conspiracy starts to reveal itself. Victoria's closest and most trusted advisor, Marcus (portrayed by a brilliant, nuanced actor), is discovered to be part of a secretive organization known as the Star Shapers, who seek to control Gamma Gamma's government from the shadows. As Victoria digs deeper into this looming conspiracy, she uncovers that the Star Shapers have infiltrated not just her own administration, but many of the other major planetary governments. Their ultimate goal: to use Gamma Gamma as the hub for their new interstellar empire, controlling trade and diplomacy across the galaxy. Act 3: The Rise of the Victorias Determined to expose and uproot the Star Shapers, Victoria assembles a team of exceptional individuals, each possessing unique skills and expertise. The team includes a rogue, ex-intelligence operative, a sassy and gifted hacker, an experienced diplomat, and a relentless journalist. They band together to confront the threat posed by the Star Shapers and restore democratic order to Gamma Gamma.

Let's consider the fictitious movie \\"Under the Misty Moon\\". Example Movie Review: Title: \\"Under the Misty Moon: A Whimsical Journey Through Love and Fear\\" \\"Under the Breathtaking Canopy of the Misty Moon\\", a visionary masterpiece from the ever-prolific director John Isles, takes the audience on a whimsical ride combining love, fear, and existentialism against the backdrop of a hauntingly beautiful lunar realm. Isles' movie unfolds with a palpable resonance that showcases his cinematic finesse. The film revolves around the internal struggle of two star-crossed lovers, portrayed magnificently by Julie Rosewood and Francis Heartfield, caught in the enigma of their own emotions beneath the eerie lunar glow. Rosewood and Heartfield's stellar performances bring their characters to life, interweaving their tales of love and terror seamlessly. They deliver a remarkable emotional depth and authenticity that whisk viewers into the heart of their tumultuous love. Isles executes the narrative brilliantly, intelligently directing every frame to create an eerily atmospheric cinematic experience. His creative prowess shines brightest in his handling of the screenplay, co-written with award-winning writer Lena Cambridge. They create dialogue that captures raw emotional intensity while also offering moments of humor and warmth. The movie is further enhanced by a beautifully haunting soundtrack that paints a surreal and ethereally magical landscape. The orchestra trills with emotion, imbuing the plot with a sense of an impending doom. The cinematography is likewise stunning, presenting the lunar world in a plethora of captivating panoramas that engulf viewers with a sense of wonder. \\"Under the Misty Moon\\" had minor setbacks - a few scenes felt unnecessarily elongated and disrupted the narrative flow. However, these hiccups hardly detract from the overall experience. In conclusion, \\"Under the Misty Moon\\" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that immerses viewers in a captivating tale of love and fear. The director's skill, stellar performances, and mesmerizing visuals make it an experience worth the time. A must-watch for those who appreciate thought-provoking, visually arresting films. I hope this serves as a useful illustration of a movie review. It tries to encompass all aspects of the movie into the review without giving away any important plot points. The review gives space for spectators to develop their own perspective and interest without severe bias."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the building in whose front the Council allowed the Ukranian government to construct a new square?

It also seems to come way too quickly. Some experts believe that women need about four months of maternity leave before they’re ready to come back, but many women only get six to eight weeks. Here’s how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Performing at Work • Ease the transition. Experts recommend starting in the middle of the week, so your first work week is short. It is also becoming more common for women to arrange to work one or two days the first week or so, or come in for a shorter day for the first two or three days to help ease the transition. The smoother your transition, the more productive you’ll be at work, says Chris Essex, director of the Center for Work and Family in Rockville, Md. • Tone down the baby talk—or not! A lot of women fear if they talk about their babies at work, people will assume they wish they were home instead of working. “Yet talking about your baby can build connections to people in the workplace,” says Jamie Ladge, assistant professor in management at Northeastern University in Boston. “People talk about their personal lives all the time at work, so it’s natural to talk about your kids.\\" But use your judgment. If you intuit that your co-workers won’t be receptive or can’t relate, then keep the cute baby stories to a minimum. • Give yourself time to adjust. Don’t think you need to reconsider your options if your first few weeks back are rocky. “When women come back to work, they’re in a lot of flux, trying to integrate how they are as a professional with their new role as a mother,” Ladge says. It may take some time to adjust to your new identity and learn how to juggle work and home responsibilities. • Ask for flex time. More and more women and men are negotiating schedules that are less rigid and can ease the stresses with working 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. “You may fear that people will think less of you if you ask, but if you don’t ask, you don’t get,” Ladge says. Talk to other employees who may have been down the same road to see what type of arrangements they have. • Ignore the comments. People can say overtly or covertly stereotypical things, which can fill you with self doubt. A seasoned mother might say, “I cried and cried when I came back to work,” making you question what kind of mom you are since you didn’t shed a tear. A boss might say, “I hope you’re not one of those women who aren’t 100 percent committed now that you have a baby.” Just laugh it off. And don’t work twice as hard to prove them wrong. • Be clear with your supervisors. Be communicative about what you want from your job and what your ambitions are so that you don’t get sidelined for promotions because of inaccurate assumptions about you now that you’re a mom. Juggling • You’ll be exhausted. If there’s a time you could use the support of your parents or some extra paid help, it is when you’re transitioning back to work. If you can get some help with cleaning and cooking during this time, it can help you feel less frazzled. • Plan the morning routine. One of the most critical issues is the division of labor between you and your spouse. Who will take showers when, who will watch the baby, feed the baby, and get the baby to child care. Ditto for dinnertime and pickup. “You and your spouse need to work it out in advance because it’s hard to negotiate when you’re tired or in the middle of a hectic schedule,” Essex says. • Alternate nighttime feedings. If you handle all the middle-of-the night feedings, you’ll be exhausted in the morning. Try to alternate nights with your husband. • Don’t try to be super-mom. Understand that you may not be able to do everything like you used to. Some things may fall by the wayside, like a perfectly clean house, or home-cooked dinners every night. Missing Your Baby • Get acclimated to child care. Test drive your child care for at least three days before going back to work to give you and your baby time to adjust. That can lower your anxiety level about your child’s transition. “Having good child care that makes you feel confident is key and reminding yourself that your baby is safe and loved will really help,” says Murphy Daly, author of The Pregnant Professional. • Do a dress rehearsal. Prior to the first day back, get all the stuff ready, have the feeding and napping things packed and ready to go,” Daly says. “Take baby to childcare and then go get your personal grooming done while you practice being away.\\" • Check in with your child care once a day. For some people, checking in may make it harder, so tailor the advice to what works for you. Some women like to have pictures of the baby at work, while for others, it may make the transition more difficult. • Don’t be surprised to miss your baby. Try not to assume that something is wrong with your work ethic for wanting to be home with your baby rather than working. Women often feel pulled in both directions, so it’s more about getting used to wanting to be in both places at once. • Think about a breastfeeding plan. If you are breastfeeding, you should start pumping and freezing milk about a month before you go back to work. Make sure you have a private place to pump at work.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

But authorities are denying permission and police have warned they won't be responsible for \\"negative... (Associated Press) MOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of people crowded into Moscow's Pushkin Square on Sunday for an unsanctioned protest against the Russian government, the biggest gathering in a wave of nationwide protests that were the most extensive show of defiance in years. Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner who is leading the opposition to President Vladimir Putin, was arrested while walking from a nearby subway station to the demonstration at Moscow's iconic Pushkin Square. Navalny and his Foundation for Fighting Corruption had called for the protests, which attracted hundreds or thousands in most sizeable Russian cities, from the Far East port of Vladivostok to the European heartland including St. Petersburg. The protests were the largest coordinated outpourings of dissatisfaction in Russia since the massive 2011-12 demonstrations that followed a fraud-tainted parliamentary election. Police estimated the Moscow crowd at about 7,000, but it could have been larger. The one-hectare (2.5-acre) Pushkin Square was densely crowded as were sidewalks on the adjacent Tverskaya Street. State news agency Tass cited Moscow police as saying about 200 people were arrested. Russia's beleaguered opposition is often seen as primarily a phenomenon of a Westernized urban elite, but Sunday's protests included gatherings in places far from cosmopolitan centers, such as Siberia's Chita and Barnaul. \\"Navalny has united people who think the same; that people don't agree with the authorities is obvious from what is going on in the country today,\\" Anna Ivanova, 19, said at the Moscow demonstration. \\"I am a bit scared.\\" Scuffles with police erupted sporadically and the arrested demonstrators included a gray-haired man whom police dragged along the pavement.

The protests Sunday focused on reports by Navalny's group claiming that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has amassed a collection of mansions, yachts and vineyards. The alleged luxuries include a house for raising ducks, so many placards in Sunday's protests featured mocking images of yellow duck toys. \\"People are unhappy with the fact that there's been no investigation\\" of the corruption allegations, said Moscow protester Ivan Gronstein. In the Pacific port city of Vladivostok, police forcefully detained some demonstrators near the city's railway terminal, in one case falling down a small grassy slope as they wrestled with a detainee. News reports and social media reported demonstrations in large cities throughout the country, including Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk. At least 25 people were reported arrested in Vladivostok and 12 in Khabarovsk. Some demonstrators showed up with their faces painted green, a reference to a recent attack on Navalny in which an assailant threw a green antiseptic liquid onto his face. ||||| Moscow (CNN) Hundreds of people, including a prominent opposition figure, were arrested in Moscow Sunday for participating in unauthorized protests, according to state media and a human rights group. The demonstrators were attending a large-scale anti-corruption demonstration in Moscow. State-run news outlet Tass reported that 8,000 people attended the protest in Moscow alone. Similar protests were planned in 100 cities across Russia, according to organizers. Opposition supporters take part in an unauthorized anti-corruption rally in central Moscow on Sunday. Russian human rights group OVD-Info tweeted that more than 700 had been detained in Moscow -- while state-run news agency Ria Novosti said 500 had been held. Among those detained was Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, according to tweets by Navalny and his press secretary. \\"Today we are discussing (and condemning) corruption, not the detentions. Well, I was detained. So what. It OK. There are things in life that are worth being detained for,\\" Navalny tweeted. The demonstrations come at a time when the safety of critics of Vladimir Putin is under scrutiny. On Thursday, a former Russian lawmaker and vocal critic of the Russian government, Denis Voronenkov, was shot dead outside a luxury hotel in the Ukrainian capital Kiev. Navalny has not commented on the killing. CNN has contacted him for comment. JUST WATCHED Chilling video shows Kremlin critic's death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chilling video shows Kremlin critic's death 02:24 Condemnation The US State Department spoke out against the arrests. \\"The United States strongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protesters throughout Russia on Sunday,\\" acting State Department spokesperson Mark Toner said in a statement. \\"We were troubled to hear of the arrest of opposition figure Alexei Navalny upon arrival at the demonstration, as well as the police raids on the anti-corruption organization he heads.\\" Toner said, \\"Detaining peaceful protesters, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values.\\" Police detain a protester in central Moscow on Sunday. The protest drew a heavy police presence but remained largely peaceful. Riot officers flanked crowds while plainclothes officers moved among the demonstrators. Police told those on the street that the protest was unsanctioned and asked them to move on. Navalny praised turnouts for the protests in early morning tweets. \\"Far East started fine,\\" he tweeted, referring to a photo of protesters gathering in the city of Vladivostok, located on Russia's far eastern coast. Navalny also shared photos and tweets from various parts of the country. Opposition supporters participate in an anti-corruption rally in central St. Petersburg on March 26, 2017. 'He is not your Dimon' The protests are part of a campaign called \\"He is not your Dimon,\\" which uses the diminutive form of the Russian name Dmitry to refer to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Navalny has accused Medvedev of amassing a global property empire through various forms of corruption. In a report published on March 2, Navalny said Medvedev has a portfolio of assets including \\"huge pieces of land in the most sought-after regions, yachts, apartments in old mansions, agricultural complexes and wineries in Russia and abroad.\\" Navalny's report claims this was all purchased through \\"bribes from oligarchs, and state bank loans.\\" Police officers detain a man during an unauthorized anti-corruption rally in central Moscow on March 26. Medvedev's spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, told state-run news agency RIA Novosti, \\"It is pointless to comment on the propagandistic outbursts of a convicted opposition figure, who has already announced he is running some kind of election campaign and fighting against the authorities.\\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the report \\"not the first creative effort from this well-known convicted citizen,\\" according to Tass. Moscow protest in sight of Kremlin Protesters in Moscow walked along Tverskaya Street, one of the city's main arteries that starts at the Kremlin walls. \\"I can't support our government, really,\\" one protester said. \\"They steal our money using their power.\\" The Moscow Police Department put out a statement Thursday urging people not to attend, calling it illegal and warning of a high risk of \\"provocative acts, designed to violate public order.\\" Police said the organizers of the event were offered an alternative location but declined. The Kremlin said Friday the event was \\"illegal\\" and a \\"provocation.\\" Navalny, who rose to prominence during the large-scale anti-government protests in Russia in 2011, has announced he plans to run for the Russian presidency in 2018. In February, he was found guilty of embezzlement in a retrial of a case that dates back to 2013. Russian law prevents convicted criminals running for public office, but Navalny has appealed the verdict. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"On 26 May 2017, thousands of people gathered in Moscow's Pushkin Square and other major Russian cities in a wave of anti-government demonstrations, the largest in years. Protests were prompted by allegations of corruption made by leading opposition figure and anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption claims that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has built a collection of mansions, yachts, and vineyards through corruption. The Moscow protests attracted an estimated 7,000 people, with Moscow police detaining around 200 participants. Navalny was also arrested for participating in the unauthorized protest. The demonstrations were the most extensive display of defiance against the government since the 2011-2012 protests following a fraud-ridden parliamentary election."},{"question":"Generate a short summary this sentence: danish peter gade is looking forward to meeting lee chong wei after third round win over simon santoso of indonesia in men 's singles at the world badminton championships here on thursday .

Ancelotti’s Real Madrid team come face to face with United in front of 109,000 fans at the enormous Michigan Stadium with Cristiano Ronaldo, who is not yet match fit. The Italian believes Van Gaal will succeed at Old Trafford but thinks it may take time. VIDEO Scroll down for Cristiano Ronaldo enjoys rub-down from Real Madrid physio... a lot! Out: Cristiano Ronaldo won't play against Manchester United after Carlo Ancelotti admitted his star man isn't fit. Pity: The Portugal international won't be able to face his old side when they play in Michigan on Saturday. Doing battle: New United boss Louis van Gaal will face a stern test against Carlo Ancelotti's Real. 'He is a very good and very experience manager, he has fantastic experience and he will do a fantastic job at United,' said Ancelotti at a press conference ahead of Real training. 'He is a manager who has nothing to learn. After Sir Alex Ferguson, it was more difficult for United, but they now have to rebuild a team. 'They have signed good players, but building a team is not easy and the Premier League is a very competitive league. 'It will not be easy to win in the first year because there are many competitive teams who want to win. 'It is not easy to implement a new system. It is important that the player is convinced, but it is difficult to say how long it will take.' Ancelotti won the Premier League title with Chelsea in his first season in 2009/10 and led Real to the Champions League crown last season. He was on United’s short-list to replace David Moyes after Ferguson’s successor was sacked last April. Asked about this on Friday, he said: 'These are rumours that usually happen, but I am at a fantastic club.

'The plan for Cristiano was right. We gave him one month of rest and started back on July 26, but he needs to recover completely and for this reason we don’t want to take a risk tomorrow. Disappointing: Ronaldo will be gutted at the news he will miss this Saturday's game against his former side. 'It’s never a friendly against Man Utd. It is a fantastic team in a fantastic stadium, but it is the last game of our tour and we want to finish well. 'We need to play a good game tomorrow because we play a fantastic team. 'I am not surprised by the crowd. The people here have a fantastic culture, they support our team and soccer is improving really quickly in the USA.' During his press conference, Ancelotti was informed by English reporters that his former Chelsea midfielder was about to join Manchester City on loan. He said: 'I didn’t know this. I’m really surprised because I thought he was coming here to play in USA to play. 'It’s too late for me to take him to Madrid but I’m really happy for Frank as I have a good memory of him.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more waste is generated happens, how will it affect fewer items are sorted. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"Let's think about this step by step: 1. \\"Items are collected\\": If more waste is generated, more items will be collected. This means the collection process could take longer or require more resources. 2. \\"The items are sorted\\": If fewer items are sorted, this could mean that the process becomes less efficient. More waste being generated might lead to a higher volume of unsorted materials, which could potentially cause issues later on in the process. More items being processed and fewer items being sorted could lead to a higher proportion of unsorted waste, potentially causing inefficiencies or problems later in the process. 3. \\"Trash is removed from everything else\\": If there are fewer items sorted, then potentially more trash could be mixed in with the other items. This could make the removal of trash more difficult and time-consuming - especially if more waste is generated overall. 4. \\"Goes to a landfill\\": If fewer items are sorted and more waste is generated overall, more waste could end up going to a landfill. This could fill up landfills faster and potentially create environmental issues. 5. \\"The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material\\": With more waste being generated and fewer items being sorted, there could be a less efficient separation of materials for the baler machine. This may negatively impact the processing of materials into bales. 6. \\"They come out as bales\\": If fewer items are sorted, potentially the bales could contain mixed materials or undesirable elements, which might cause a problem for manufacturers. 7. \\"The bales are shipped to manufacturers to use to make products\\": If the sorted items decrease and waste generated increase, manufacturers may receive bales with mixed materials or contaminants, causing difficulties in the production process. In conclusion, the perturbation of generating more waste and having fewer items sorted does indeed have a direct or indirect impact on the process. The sorting process acts as a critical point in the waste management system. So, reducing its efficiency while generating more waste could create significant issues throughout the whole process."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Maybe good but...

He dismisses the allegations, saying his opponents have gone too far this time. The woman in question tells an Italian TV station she never had sex with him. Italy's top court just struck down a law shielding Berlusconi from prosecution.","response":"Title: Italy's Prime Minister Battling Accusations of Illicit Relations with Teen Dancer Introduction: In a recent scandal that's taking Italy by storm, the nation's Prime Minister is facing allegations of having engaged in sexual relations with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer. The Prime Minister has dismissed these allegations, citing that his opponents have taken things too far in their pursuits against him. Step 1: Present the accusations The controversy began when Italy's Prime Minister was accused of engaging in sexual relations with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer. As a leader of the nation, such allegations have raised questions about his integrity and have put his leadership under the microscope. Step 2: Describe the Prime Minister's response In response to these allegations, the Prime Minister has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, stating that his opponents were merely attempting to discredit him by going too far in their attacks. He asserts that not only are these accusations baseless, but they are also a reflection of political maneuvering by those wishing to topple his administration. Step 3: Include the woman's reaction and statement In addition to the Prime Minister's dismissal of the allegations, the woman in question, who has not been named thus far, has also come forward stating that she has never engaged in a sexual relationship with the Prime Minister. Speaking to an Italian TV station, she made it clear that the accusations were not based on any factual information. Step 4: Discuss the recent legal developments Complicating matters further, Italy's top court has recently struck down a law that had previously protected Berlusconi from prosecution. This ruling now paves the way for potential legal consequences if the Prime Minister is ever found to be guilty of the allegations being brought against him. Conclusion: While the scandal continues to make headlines and captivate the nation, it remains to be seen whether these allegations against Italy's Prime Minister will be substantiated. For now, both the Prime Minister and the woman at the center of the scandal have denied any wrongdoing. As the investigation unfolds, it will be important to keep an eye on legal developments that may further impact Italy's political landscape."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Question: How would Riley feel as a result? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: like they understand Lee better B: curious C: they do not see anything A:","response":"Based on the given context, it can be inferred that Riley would feel a mix of emotions and curiosity as a result of the glimpse into Lee's life. In this scenario, Lee took the initiative to provide an insight into their own life, which suggests that they want to establish a closer connection or strengthen their bond with Riley. It is reasonable to assume that this would lead Riley to feel like they understand Lee better and evoke a sense of curiosity, as they would want to explore their potential life together further. Thus, between the options provided, answer B: curious, would be the most fitting according to the context. Although answer A: like they understand Lee better, may also be accurate to some extent, the question is specifically asking about how Riley would feel as a result of this glimpse, which leans more towards answer B as curiosity would likely be the dominant emotion triggered from this experience.

As they continue to share more about their lives, it is possible that they may find common ground in their values, interests, and aspirations, ultimately shaping the nature of their relationship.

The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice.

Article: Do you or someone you know use a mobile phone? In today's world, many people use a mobile phone especially businessmen and businesswomen. These people are an important part of the business world and help our economies develop. In fact in some countries even children and the elderly use mobile phones to keep in touch with family and friends. We know how useful it is to have a mobile phone, but do we know how safe these phones are? Some scientists say that mobile phones could be a risk to our health. So, money is being given to scientific research to find out if mobile phones may be harmful in any way. What does the future look like? Is a hands - free phone the answer? The idea behind hands - free sets is simple and maybe they are a safer way for people to communicate. The hands - free set has a piece in your ear and a microphone near your mouth which is connected to a wire that goes into your phone. Some scientists think this is a much safer way to use a phone. Some scientists have proved that a mobile phone 10 centimeters from your head is far safer than if the headset is right against your ear. Some reports say that hands - free sets have 95% less radiation exposure, while other reports say that hands - free sets expose you to more radiation. Governments and the mobile phone industry are researching the effects, including: * the effects of radio waves on blood pressure and the brain, such as the abilities to concentrate, remember and learn the connections between mobile phone use and brain cancer long - term effects of mobile phone use, looking at health histories of people who have used mobiles since the 1980s. They will be looking at both current mobile phones and the new generation of 4G phones. The results from these studies will help us understand more about the world beyond mobile communications. Wouldn't it be strange if scientists discovered that mobile phones were too dangerous and we had to stop using them and go back to writing letter and using the normal telephone? Question: From the passage we can know _ . - wearing headsets is a safer way when we communicate with mobile phones - nobody can tell exactly which the safer way to use a mobile phone is - we'd better stop using hands - free sets while scientists are looking at them - there is some connections between mobile phone use and some illness A:","response":"From the passage, we can know that nobody can tell exactly which the safer way to use a mobile phone is.

The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win. With the win, Washington improved to 3-3, snapped an 8-game home losing streak, and will have an opportunity to take first place in the NFC East with a victory over the defending Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants next week.

Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for \\"wickedly\\" estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, the Prince of Wales, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been \\"killed by that dreadful business\\", she said. She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years. Her seclusion earned her the nickname \\"widow of Windsor\\". Q: What disease was Albert diagnosed with?","response":"Albert was diagnosed with typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food, water, or contact with an infected person. This disease, which presented with symptoms such as high fever, headache, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, was potentially deadly during the 19th century due to the limited medical knowledge and treatments available at that time. As a result, Albert's illness took a severe toll on his health and ultimately led to his death on 14th December 1861. This tragic event had a profound impact on Queen Victoria, driving her into a state of deep mourning and causing her to wear black for the remainder of her life."},{"question":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Bill Cowher could be atop Dolphins' wish list UPDATE SUNDAY: Cowher said on CBS that he has \\"not been contacted directly or indirectly by any football team or any organization.\\" He added he plans to remain with the network in 2012. Ross also tried to debunk the report, telling the (South Florida) Sun-Sentinel, \\"I'm not going to reach out to anyone while Tony is the coach. I hope he wins and stays the coach. Neither I nor anyone involved with me has contacted (Cowher), his agent or anyone around him.\\" It seems Miami coach Tony Sparano has been twisting in the wind for nearly a year now, seemingly brought back for the 2011 season only after Dolphins owner Stephen Ross' public courting of Jim Harbaugh in January failed. One 0-6 start later, it seems Ross has moved on to Bill Cowher. NFL Network's Albert Breer reports that Ross has contacted Cowher's agent, though Cowher won't personally speak to a team currently employing a head coach nor will he accept any job until the season is complete. Cowher went 161-99-1 in 15 years as the Steelers' head man. He coached Pittsburgh to a Super Bowl XL victory, led the team to Super Bowl XXX and oversaw 10 trips to postseason. He's worked as an analyst for CBS since leaving the Steel City following the 2006 season. Sparano sparked a turnaround in Miami in 2008, guiding the team to a surprising AFC East crown during his rookie season, just a year after the Dolphins went 1-15. But since then, the team is 14-24, has lost 12 of 13 at home in front of a dwindling fan base and has yet to win in 2011. Sparano is frequently peppered with questions about his job security, which seems ever more tenuous. The Dolphins have hired five head coaches since legendary Don Shula retired after the 1995 season. The franchise has notched just three playoff wins in the post-Shula era.","response":"Reports suggest that Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has contacted Bill Cowher's agent as a potential replacement for current coach Tony Sparano. However, Cowher has denied being contacted by any football team and reaffirmed his commitment to CBS for 2012.

Whether it's a workout, spending time with friends, or simply relaxing at home, it helps me recharge. John: Interesting, but does that not affect your productivity or commitment towards work? Sarah: It might seem that way, but having a balanced life actually allows me to be more focused and productive during work hours. When I'm at work, I'm fully committed. And when I'm off, I invest time in my personal life. John: Hmm, I've never thought about it like that. It could be worth a try. But, I'm afraid I might fall behind on my work.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. The extensive grazing in Tibet lead to carbon and nitrogen loss, subject to desertification, while Nepal adopted a different approach to food production, putting nature and biodiversity first. Which country experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine which country experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity. However, we can infer that Nepal might have a better approach to maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem health by putting nature and biodiversity first in their food production methods. By doing so, Nepal may have a more sustainable and adaptable ecosystem compared to the degraded lands in the Tibetan Plateau, which have led to several environmental and economic issues. To make a more definitive statement, we would need to compare specific data on the anthropogenic productivity of both countries, taking into account factors such as agricultural yield, land use practices, and economic valuation of the ecosystem services provided by the land."},{"question":"@aiderushton If you have one invite to Spotify, I would be grateful Thanks!

Options are: - use half a pomegranate and half an orange - use half an orange and half a lemon","response":"The correct answer is: use half an orange and half a lemon. When you can't find Meyer lemons, the best alternative is to use a combination of regular lemons and oranges. Meyer lemons have a sweeter taste compared to regular lemons, and the mixture of orange (which is sweet) and lemon (which is sour) will give you a similar flavor to Meyer lemons. Using half a pomegranate and half an orange doesn't make sense because pomegranates have a completely different taste and texture compared to Meyer lemons. They won't give you the same flavor as Meyer lemons in your recipe."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Drainage of the abscess may be carriedout under ultrasound guidance though in some dogs abdominal surgery may be required","response":"Drainage of the abscess may be carried out under ultrasound guidance; however, in some dogs, abdominal surgery may be required."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more. It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace? A. More calories will be burned B. So there is more time in the day to exercise, since you will be done with chores faster C. Stretching your arms will make you more flexible D. not enough information Answer:","response":"A.

The load on a truck may not be more than 900 kilograms. One bag of lemons has a mass of 8 kilograms. If there are 100 bags of lemons, how many more kilograms can still be loaded into the truck? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Determine the total mass of the 100 bags of lemons. To do that, multiply the mass of one bag (8 kg) by the number of bags (100). 8 kg/bag * 100 bags = 800 kg Step 2: Calculate the remaining capacity of the truck. To do that, subtract the total mass of the lemons (800 kg) from the maximum load capacity of the truck (900 kg). 900 kg - 800 kg = 100 kg From this calculation, we can conclude that there is still room for 100 more kilograms to be loaded into the truck."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: NASA has opened the door to the next generation of space discovery by announcing great plans for a base for humans to live on the surface of the moon forever. The project to build a base on the moon will begin soon after 2020, with astronauts living there within four years. The project comes after several excellent scientists and environmentalists asked humans to look beyond Earth to ensure the survival of the species . Eventually, the moon will be a base for humans to explore the solar system and one day land on Mars. NASA began planning for the first moon landing since 1972 when George Bush, the US president, announced his new plan for space exploration four years ago. NASA has already talked about the design of the Orion spacecraft that will replace the old space shuttle fleet in 2010. The plan for the moon base, however, is the first detailed explanation of how NASA intends to prepare for the first manned exploration of deep space and a possible Mars mission within 30 years. Scientists also believe that the south pole on the moon contain rich natural gases such as the rare helium-3 that could be used as fuel for the generation of nuclear power. Besides, teams of astronauts living there for six months at a time would mine for hydrogen and oxygen to make water and possibly rocket fuel.

The establishment of a moon base is intended to serve as a stepping stone towards deep space exploration and future manned missions to Mars. Additionally, it is a response to the call from several esteemed scientists and environmentalists who have urged humanity to look beyond Earth for the preservation of our species. Furthermore, constructing a moon base offers opportunities to mine vital resources, like hydrogen and oxygen, which can be used to produce water and potentially rocket fuel. The south pole of the moon is believed to contain natural gases such as helium-3, a scarce resource that could be employed to generate nuclear power. The focus of these plans is on scientific advancement, resource extraction, and the potential for human settlement, rather than showcasing the power of the United States."},{"question":"Q: Passage: It took a long time before the Israelites could subdue the Canaanite inhabitants of the land.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the sentences convey contrasting ideas. Let's analyze both sentences to understand their meanings and see why they are not related in the manner suggested. Sentence 1: \\"But I, yeah, I do want to have a raised bed. I've never... my flower gardens have always been like on the ground.\\" This sentence shows that the speaker wants to have a raised bed for their flower garden, but they have never had one before. The speaker's flower gardens have traditionally been on the ground, not raised. This implies that the speaker has experience with ground-level gardening and is now expressing interest in trying raised-bed gardening. Sentence 2: \\"I've always had raised flower garden beds.\\" The second sentence straightforwardly states that the speaker has consistently had raised garden beds. By saying \\"I've always had,\\" the speaker is asserting that in all their gardening experiences, they have used raised beds. In summary, the first sentence illustrates a desire to change from ground-level gardening to raised bed gardening, while the second sentence suggests that the speaker already has a long-standing history with raised-bed gardening. Consequently, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they express opposing perspectives on the speaker's engagement with raised garden beds."},{"question":"Rev.

In New York City FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives demands to release the sheikh. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA agent Elise Kraft (Bening). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Input: \\"Handsome Guys With Bad Haircuts !!\\" \\"Beautiful Girls Without Any Clues !!\\" \\"Stupid Gangsters Who Cannot Shoot Straight !!\\" From Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama, \\"Dragon Heat.\\" For reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured, the production and casting call for this 'criminals-on-steroids' movie somehow got both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign on as villains. But they don't get all that much to do in this horrid slug-fest.They are two of the best contemporary actors around, each with their own resume' and list of accomplishments, and Biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non-heroic roles.Maggie Q was the super-bad \\"Mai\\" in \\"Live Free Or Die Hard,\\" so 'nuff said.Biehn is, of course, famous for being the soldier-from-the-future who made \\"The Terminator\\" of 1984 such a believable science-fiction/fantasy romp, by crashing up against Big Arnold, who is now the Governator of California !! Michael Biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible train-wreck of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason for that, as the incredibly convoluted plot -- given mostly in Chinese, as it is a Hong Kong story -- could have been better elaborated for non-Chinese audiences with a foreign narrator.In other words, if Biehn had been used as something like an Interpol observer or coordinator, or an agent under deep cover, who needs to get some 'splaining given to him every five or ten minutes, that would have been great. But no, he's brought in as a part of an odd group of special forces-type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal, in the middle of somebody else's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals. Yes, there, I said it all. Confused ? Me too. \\"Welcome to the party, pal.\\"In the truly superb Hong Kong crime drama, known by its English title as \\"Breaking News,\\" there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot. Bad guys vs. good cops. In this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a Hong Kong Triad, or gang, it seems that the hot-shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, the way the criminals mow them down.So, not surprisingly, there's an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene ( several scenes, in fact ), where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game, to win stuffed animal prizes. And so the hot shot good-guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf, so that the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls.There's also a half-hearted attempt at creating a \\"love interest\\" between one of the 'visiting cops' and the sole female 'visiting cop'.The visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the Triad gangster leader, who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance, but not by his own team but by the mercenaries ( Biehn, Maggie Q, and some others ). These killers all want something but we don't get to learn about what it is, until the very end of the film !! That was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story.You cannot build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain, or get, or get away from, being introduced very early in the story.Add to that some \\"cut-away scenes\\" done for purely artsy effects, all showing the bad-bad guys' and the regular bad guys' recent pasts, and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong. Output:","response":"Negative Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The review starts with a negative description of characters: \\"Handsome Guys With Bad Haircuts !!\\", \\"Beautiful Girls Without Any Clues !!\\", \\"Stupid Gangsters Who Cannot Shoot Straight !!\\". 2.

The plot is described as \\"incredibly convoluted\\" and confusing. 4. Comparing this movie to \\"Breaking News,\\" the reviewer refers to \\"Dragon Heat\\" as \\"wretched and excessively violent\\". 5. The love interest subplot is described as \\"half-hearted\\". 6. The plot reveals the main objective late, which the reviewer indicates as a \\"stupid mistake.\\" 7. The reviewer criticizes \\"cut-away scenes\\" as being added for \\"purely artsy effects.\\" 8.

Yes, we can conclude that \\"The gang members were trying to run the drug trade in the neighborhood.\\" Based on the information provided, we can deduce a few things from this statement: \\"The police arrested all of the gang members. They were trying to run the drug trade in the neighborhood.\\" Firstly, the text explicitly states that the police arrested all of the gang members. This implies that there was an issue with the activity the gang members were engaging in – they were participating in illegal or harmful behavior that garnered attention from law enforcement. Secondly, the statement goes on to say, \\"They were trying to run the drug trade in the neighborhood.\\" The use of the pronoun \\"they\\" refers to the preceding subject, which in this case are the gang members. By using the context clues in the sentence structure, it is clear that the subject of their illegal activity is related to attempting to run the drug trade within the neighborhood. Thus, based on the information given, we can infer that the gang members were responsible for attempting to run the drug trade in the neighborhood. Consequently, the answer is [b].

Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments. Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, \\"I will.\\" She said, \\"I feel sorry for you, Nardo. I'll see Emil home.\\" \\"Yes,\\" I said, \\"Do that,\\" and did not care what she did, or why. Emil asked, \\"You're all right?\\" I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent. They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves.

Hint: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch.

PUBLISHED:. 06:50 EST, 15 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:43 EST, 15 January 2013. An amateur footballer was gunned down by a gangland hitman in front of 150 spectators as he was warming up for a match with teammates. Alan Jopson, 27, was doing stretch exercises just before kick-off at a playing field in Liverpool when the masked gunman calmly jogged on to the pitch and shot him in the legs. The victim was hit three times in both legs and lay reeling in agony as the would-be assassin fled in a silver getaway car. Crowd in shock: Alan Jopson was gunned down when a hitman jogged calmly on to a pitch at Simpson Playing Fields, Liverpool, on Saturday afternoon. Jopson, who plays for West Derby side Alder, was treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuries and is believed to have given a statement to police. Liverpool is currently in the grip of a string of tit-for-tat shootings. The gunman struck shortly before 2pm on Saturday as the match between amateur league clubs Allerton FC and Alder, in Division 1 of the Liverpool County Premier League, was about to kick off. As the teams ventured out on to a pitch at the busy Simpson Playing Fields in Woolton, the gunman pulled into the car park at the grounds in a silver vehicle, got out and ran on to the grass after them. Peter Woods, Allerton secretary, said: 'I was in the changing room and the next thing I knew, when I went outside to watch the game, everyone was running away as fast as they could. 'There must have been 100 people there, maybe 150, all milling around. Everyone just fled. 'I couldn't believe it when I found out that the lad had been shot. The city is gun crazy - shootings outside schools, on football pitches. It is ridiculous.' Liverpool County Premier league. secretary Iain Munro said: 'It's a busy ground and a number of games. were about to start. It's shocking. 'We know it's not a football-related incident. The victim was targeted as the person knew where they were playing football. The gunman came on the field while the teams were warming up, identified a player, and shot him three times.' The game was immediately abandoned and the car park, the playing fields and surrounding area were cordoned off for forensic investigations to take place. A spokesman for Alder FC also said the incident was 'not football-related'. He added: 'We have got absolutely nothing to do with what happened.' Merseyside Police confirmed the shooting was a targeted attack, but the motive was not yet known. Ch Supt Ngaire Waine said: 'It's a very rare thing to happen anywhere - let alone a football pitch. 'It was brazen reckless attack in full daylight which showed a total disregard for the safety of other people. We've identified over 80 people who witnessed it. ' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"This is a pretty scary story, sweetheart, but I'll try to tell it in a way that won't scare you. Ok, so, you know how in your soccer games sometimes people come over to watch and cheer? Imagine that, but this time, an unexpected man came onto the field. This man was not very nice and did something bad: He hurt a soccer player named Alan who was just about to start his game. He did this in front of lots of people, which was very, very wrong. After he did the bad thing, the man quickly left in a shiny car. Poor Alan was hurt and had to go to the hospital, but his injuries were not going to take his life away, so that's good news. The grown-ups who were in charge of the soccer match had to stop it because of what happened, and they had to close the area to look for clues about the bad man. Even more grown-ups, the type that are like superheros because they protect us from bad people, also known as police, have said that this bad thing happened not because of soccer, but because the bad man specifically wanted to hurt Alan. The reason why is something they still have to figure out.

The former Alaska governor recalled that the national press “tore apart” George W. Bush for using “fleeting images” from Sept. 11, 2001, during his 2004 reelection campaign. Text Size - + reset At the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting, Palin slammed Obama for flying the grieving parents of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Air Force One and then “making them backdrops” at rallies. (PHOTOS: NRA annual meeting) “That same media is now the reliable poodle-skirted cheerleader for the president that writes the book on exploiting tragedy,” she said, wearing a T-shirt that said “women hunt.” Palin insisted that all Americans felt “despair, sadness and absolute anger” when they saw what happened in Connecticut. She said everyone should care more about those getting gunned down every single day on the streets of places like Chicago and New York City, but that shouldn’t guide public policy. “Now, emotion is a good and a necessary thing. But we have politicians exploiting emotion for their own agenda,” she said. “We have well-meaning Americans who are desperate to respond.” Palin, a longtime NRA member, pleased the crowd by noting that her son Trigg’s nickname is “Trigger” and that her nephew’s middle name is Remington. She was rewarded with a standing ovation after describing the 4.5 million members of the group as her “brothers and sisters.” NRA chief lobbyist Chris Cox praised Palin for criticizing a police chief who would not give out conceal-and-carry permits during her first run for mayor of Wasilla, Alaska. “We’re fighting the good fight,” Palin said near the end of a 12-minute speech. “The Washington establishment sneers at you, and you don’t give up. The lamestream media just plain doesn’t get you, and you don’t give up. You don’t retreat.” Palin took a shot at New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, always a bogeyman at these gatherings. At her last big public event – the Conservative Political Action Conference in March – she sipped a Big Gulp from the podium to mock his ban on the sale of the large sodas. She told the NRA crowd that Bloomberg may next try to ban public displays of tobacco products. Then she pulled out a container of snuff. “I tell ya, don’t make me do it,” she joked. “It’s funny because [my husband] Todd’s been looking for this all morning.” ||||| 4 years ago (CNN) – Sarah Palin blasted President Barack Obama and gun control advocates Friday, blaming them for \\"exploiting\\" recent mass shooting tragedies to promote their political agenda.

In the days leading up to the Senate's April 17 vote on gun control proposals, the president invited families of Newtown victims to fly on Air Force One to Washington and lobby Congress. Newtown families also participated in media interviews and appeared in an ad made by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the pro-gun control group co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. When the upper chamber ultimately fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass a bipartisan compromise to expand the background check system, some of those family members stood behind the president not long after the vote as he chided Capitol Hill for what he described as a \\"shameful day in Washington.\\" Palin argued the president was practicing the \\"politics of emotion\\" by \\"flying in grieving parents on Air Force One, making them backdrops in his perpetual campaign-style press events.\\" Par for the course, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee faulted the media for being a \\"reliable, poodle-skirted cheerleader for a president who writes the book on exploiting tragedy.\\" Politics of emotion, she argued, won't make the country safer. \\"It's the opposite of leadership.

Turkey last week summoned the German envoy to demand the song be withdrawn. But both Germany and the EU have insisted press freedom is inviolable. In the song, Mr Erdogan is criticised on a range of issues ranging from the imprisonment of journalists to heavy-handed treatment of protesters including women (\\"equal rights for women - they are beaten up equally\\"). \\"When a journalist writes a piece that Erdogan doesn't like, he quickly ends up in jail, newspaper offices closed down, he doesn't think twice, with tear gas and water cannons he is riding through the night,\\" say some of the lyrics.

In response, Turkey summoned the German envoy last week to demand the removal of the song. However, both Germany and the EU have insisted that press freedom is inviolable. The song criticizes Erdogan on various issues, such as imprisoning journalists, heavy-handed treatment of protesters, and his approach to bombing Kurds instead of the so-called Islamic State. The satirical piece also mocks the recent migration deal between European states and Turkey. Despite Turkey's demands, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker stated that calling in the German ambassador over a satirical song \\"moves Turkey further from the EU rather than closer to us.\\" The German foreign ministry also reinforced that basic freedoms were \\"non-negotiable.\\" Erdogan's strict stance against criticism has been highlighted by the fact that more than 1,800 people, including celebrities and schoolchildren, have been prosecuted in Turkey for insulting him since he took office in 2014."},{"question":"MILTON, Ont. – Police say a 32-year-old man has been charged with mischief and arson after allegedly trying to set a hair salon on fire in Milton, Ont. Halton Regional Police allege the suspect smashed the front window of the business on Saturday evening. The man allegedly tried to use an accelerant to help set the salon ablaze, but police say he was unsuccessful and the fire burned out. Police say the man faces two counts of mischief under 5000 and one count of arson. They say the man was held for a bail hearing. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\" Based on the report the man was released on bail and is awaiting trial\\"?","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclusively determine that the man was released on bail and is awaiting trial. The paragraph states, \\"Police say the man was held for a bail hearing\\", which means he was to appear before a judge for a bail determination. However, the paragraph does not provide any information about the outcome of that bail hearing. There are a few possible scenarios that may have occurred: 1. The man was granted bail: In this scenario, the judge might have set specific conditions and an amount for the man's bail, and if those conditions are met, he might have been released from custody to await trial. 2. The man was denied bail: It is also possible that the judge determined the man to be a potential risk to the public or a flight risk, and thus, denied his request for bail. In this situation, the man would remain in custody while awaiting trial. 3. Insufficient information provided: As mentioned earlier, the paragraph does not give detailed information about the results of the bail hearing. In order to accurately determine the man's current status, more information would be needed such as his release, bail amount, and any potential conditions, or information on whether he was denied bail and remains in custody. In conclusion, we cannot assume that the man has been released on bail and is awaiting trial based solely on the information provided in the paragraph. More details about the bail hearing's outcome and for any subsequent developments would be needed to draw an accurate conclusion."},{"question":"Is \\"One of the league's early success stories was the Detroit Drive.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What team did Art Schlichter play for?\\"","response":"No, that answer doesn't directly tell us what team Art Schlichter played for.

These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"DNA and RNA contact mainly during the process of transcription. In this process, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of a specific gene on the DNA. The enzyme then unwinds the DNA double helix and synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. Transcription factors, activator proteins, and repressor proteins are involved in regulating this process, and they interact with the DNA through regulatory sequences such as enhancers and silencers. These regulatory elements can loop the DNA, bringing them in close proximity to the RNA polymerase binding site, thus affecting RNA synthesis and gene expression."},{"question":"Information: - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Star Search is an American television show that was produced T.P.E./Rysher Entertainment from 1983 to 1995, hosted by Ed McMahon, and created by Alfred Masini. A relaunch was produced by 2929 Productions from 2003 to 2004. On both versions of the show, contestants competed in several genres of entertainment. The show was originally filmed at the old Earl Carroll Theatre (now known as Nickelodeon on Sunset), at 6230 Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and later at the Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. - A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. The first boy bands consisted of the Beatles, Jackson 5, the Monkees, and the Osmonds singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances. - Pharrell Lanscilo Williams (born April 5, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter, rapper, record producer, and film producer. - NSYNC (sometimes stylized as NSYNC or 'N Sync) was an American boy band formed in Orlando, Florida in 1995 and launched in Germany by BMG Ariola Munich. NSYNC consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager Lou Pearlman and former record label Bertelsmann Music Group, the group's second album, \\"No Strings Attached\\", sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42 million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. In addition to a host of Grammy Award nominations, NSYNC has performed at the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Olympic Games, and sang or recorded with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Celine Dion, Aerosmith, Britney Spears, Nelly, Left Eye, Mary J. Blige, country music supergroup Alabama, and Gloria Estefan. - The Neptunes are an American production duo, composed of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, who are credited with contributing the sound for many successful hip hop and R&B artists in the late-1990s and 2000s. The Neptunes' sound is a distinctive brand of off-kilter, stripped-down electronic funk with sounds from Middle Eastern and Asian music including percussion and woodwind. Pharrell sings and (later) raps on records and appears in videos, unlike his production partner Chad, who tends to stay behind the scenes. - \\"Rock Your Body\\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake for his debut studio album, \\"Justified\\" (2002). It was written by Timberlake along with The Neptunes (consisting of Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams), who also produced the track. The song was released on April 7, 2003 by Jive Records as the third single from \\"Justified\\". The track is an uptempo, disco groove, soul infused song containing influences from Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. The female section of the track is sung by Vanessa Marquez. Originally intended to be featured on Jackson's tenth studio album \\"Invincible\\" (2001), the latter rejected the song along with several other tracks, which were instead given to Timberlake for his debut album. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"When bigger particles hit the rock, it affects the erosion of rocks in both a direct and indirect manner. Let's analyze how this perturbation impacts the given process step by step. 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: When bigger particles interact with rocks, they directly impact the erosion process by causing more significant abrasion or fragmentation. The removal of small pieces of rock each time bigger particles touch the rocks results in more substantial chunks being broken off, leading to a quicker overall deterioration. During these interactions, the energy and mass of larger particles can cause higher stress on the rock, leading to quicker fragmentation and disintegration of the rock structure. As a result, bigger particles accelerate the erosion process by removing more substantial parts of the rock. Due to the larger mass and higher striking force of these particles, the erosion happens more rapidly than if smaller particles were solely responsible. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Bigger particles hitting the rock can also indirectly impact the erosion process by changing the overall environment where the rocks are found. For instance, when larger particles remove significant parts of rock, they can alter the surrounding landscape and lead to further changes in environmental factors, including water flow patterns and wind speed. These alterations may, in turn, expose the rocks to different kinds of erosional forces, affecting the overall pace of erosion. This aspect is especially notable in cases where water or wind is transporting the larger particles, leading to more potent erosive forces. In summary, the perturbation of bigger particles hitting the rock both directly and indirectly impacts the erosion process. While their immediate influence involves accelerated erosion due to increased abrasion or fragmentation, they can also lead to indirect impacts through changes in environmental factors, which may further modify the rate of erosion. Therefore, in this scenario, the erosion of rocks would not be less or slower. Instead, it would most likely be quicker and more extensive due to the larger size of particles involved in the process."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a sentence and a question in the input.

(b). hair was too weak..","response":"(b). hair was too weak. In an attempt to grow my hair, I applied coconut oil, but my hair split because the hair was too weak. I realized that I had been neglecting my hair's health for quite some time now. Determined to improve the situation, I decided to make a comprehensive plan to restore my hair's strength and vitality. Step 1: Research hair care techniques Before starting any new hair care routine, I spent some time researching various techniques and products that can help improve hair strength and promote growth. I visited online forums, read blog articles, and even watched YouTube videos to gather a wealth of knowledge on hair care. Step 2: Determine the root cause I wanted to figure out what factors had contributed to my hair becoming so weak. Was it the chemicals, constant heat, or improper care? Upon closer examination, I concluded that I had been using excessive heat, not trimming my split ends, and using harsh chemical-laden products. Addressing these issues would be key to restoring my hair's health. Step 3: Create a hair care routine To combat my weak hair, I developed a hair care routine that incorporated both internal and external strategies. I started taking multivitamins containing biotin, which is known for benefiting hair and nails. I also began massaging my scalp with coconut oil regularly, as well as applying deep-conditioning hair masks at least once a week. Step 4: Limit heat and chemical exposure To reduce heat exposure, I limited the use of my hair straightener, curling iron, and blow-dryer. On days when it was necessary to use these tools, I made sure to apply a heat protectant spray before styling. I also switched to sulfate-free and silicone-free hair products, as they are less harsh on the hair strands. Step 5: Trim split ends To ensure my hair was in its best condition, I visited a professional hairdresser to trim my split ends. I pledged to schedule regular trims every 6-8 weeks to prevent further damage and keep my hair looking healthy. Step 6: Stay consistent The final and most important step was consistency. I knew that following my hair care routine with dedication would yield positive results. I set reminders to help me stay on track with my routine. Over the course of a few months, I could see my hair start to regain its strength, and the split ends gradually diminished. With continuous care, not only did the coconut oil help my hair grow, but it also restored its health and vitality. The journey taught me the importance of giving my hair the attention and care it deserves."},{"question":"Next question: who was the first host on price is right?","response":"To find out who was the first host on the game show \\"Price Is Right\\", I will follow these steps: 1.

Reasoning: The genetic information in a human cell is stored in the form of DNA molecules, which are packaged in structures known as chromosomes. Each cell typically has 46 chromosomes, which come in 23 identical pairs. However, there are also specialized cells called gametes (sperm and egg cells) that are involved in sexual reproduction. Gametes have only half the usual number of chromosomes (23 unpaired chromosomes). When a sperm and egg cell combine during fertilization, the resulting zygote has a total of 46 chromosomes (23 from each parent). If a person were to have two cells, one being a normal body cell and one being a gamete, then the total number of chromosomes between these two cells would be 62 (46 in the body cell and 16 in the gamete)."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Je mange une pomme.

The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Hunted Movie plot: Paul Racine, a computer-chip executive from New York, is on a business trip to Nagoya. He meets Kirina in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship. Mieko explains the history of the two clans' conflict and the samurai concepts of courage and honor.

Both of these sites provide detailed information on what to look for in an ethical breeder, and can point you toward more local resources. Do further research into these local German Shepherd breed clubs in your area. Whether you get information from their websites or contact them directly for help, local breed clubs are a great way to get the names of reputable breeders in your area. Veterinarians come into contact with a lot of different types of animal care-givers, from breeders to shelters to individual owners. Because they know so much about animal issues in the community, it's a good idea to talk to a few vets in your area for ethical breeder recommendations. Also consider speaking to other German Shepherd owners, dog groomers, or dog trainers. If you visit a breed show, talk to owners and trainers about who they've had good or bad experiences with. A good breeder won't have a variety of breeds available for adoption. Look for a breeder who specializes only in German Shepherds. Your best option is to find a breeder who has years of experience with the German Shepherd breed. They should be able to answer your questions about development, temperament, and training easily and without hesitation. A key marker of a good breeder is the amount of effort they put into early socialization. Puppies need to be taught from an early age to live harmoniously with humans. If a breeder keeps litters isolated away from the home, the puppies will not be used to the sights and sounds of a normal household, and won't be used to human interaction. This can become a problem by the time they are old enough to be adopted. Make sure the puppies spend at least some time in the breeders' home with them. The more time they spend with humans, the more you can trust the breeder. An ethical breeder will never try to breed a female who hasn't reached sexual maturity — about 2 years of age. Mothers should also be given enough time to recover from pregnancies and being separated from their litters as they get adopted. Females should be healthy and alert. Never adopt a puppy from a breeder who breeds a young or unhealthy female, or who doesn't give mothers time to recover before breeding them again. Puppies should never be sold or separated from their mothers before 8 weeks of age. Before that, it’s unsafe to wean them from their mothers. The breeder should have begun the puppies' vaccination and deworming processes before adopting them out. Make sure that's happened, and ask about any health problems the vet may have reported in these early checkups. Ask if the breeders have their dogs tested for the Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) gene. This can determine whether a common inherited disease in German Shepherds is present in the litter's bloodline. Dogs with DM suffer from progressive paralysis, particularly in the hind legs.[5] Also ask the breeder whether the parents are \\"OFA certified\\" or \\"AKC Registered.\\" You can ask to see certification for both parents from one of these organizations, but reputable breeders usually offer this without asking. Note that being AKC-registered does not mean that you are getting a healthy animal. It means that the owner paid money to the AKC to register the dog. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), on the other hand, is interested in orthopedic and genetic health. German Shepherds commonly have hip and elbow dysplasia. While experts recommend against breeding animals with known genetic problems, an OFA certification will give you proof. Be aware, though, that there's no guarantee of health in any animal. There's always a chance that two dogs free of known genetic diseases can still produce a puppy with genetic problems. The breeder should be evaluating you as a potential owner, just as you're evaluating him or her as a breeder. No good breeder will just hand over a puppy without being sure that the new owners will be able to provide it with a good, healthy life. Ask the breeder what they look for in a good owner, and whether they've ever turned potential owners away. The breeder should be able to answer these questions without even having to think about it. You might also ask the breeder for references so you can contact other families who have dogs from previous litters. A reputable breeder should ask questions about your dog background and experience, your lifestyle, and your family to guide you in making the best decision. As difficult as it may be, a good breeder will be willing to turn you away if they think you're a bad fit for their particular puppies. For example, if the litter has particularly inactive parents, the puppies may not be a good fit for your highly active lifestyle. If you get turned away, ask if the breeder can point you to other options and litters so you can expand your search. Also ask if they have any unborn litters coming up that may be a better fit for you. Be patient and don't get discouraged. With enough patience and legwork, you'll find the right puppy. Don't lie to a breeder just to get a puppy, though. Trust the breeder's decision-making process. You don't want to end up with a dog who doesn't fit your needs. Avoid any breeder who offers to cut you a \\"deal,\\" who has unclean or smelly kennels, or who acts suspiciously in any way. Trust your instincts. A breeder who's in it just for the money has the wrong motivation, and likely isn't interested in the welfare of their dogs. Make sure the dogs are not crowded into cages. They should have plenty of room to stumble around and explore their surroundings. Part of the time, puppies should be kept in the home to expose them to household environments. There should be adequate food and water for all animals on the premises. Kennels should be cleaned daily. Although it may be that a dog had an accident just before you arrived, be suspicious of a kennel that looks like it hasn't been cleaned recently. All reputable breeders should be willing to take the dog back should things not work out with your family. If a breeder doesn't have a return policy, it suggests they don't really care what happens to their dogs once they leave their property. That's not a good sign! Also find out what kind of documentation you would get with your puppy. Would you get registration papers and pedigree papers? Negotiate for what you want if it's not included in the contract. Be very wary of a breeder who will not discuss the chance that a puppy may need to be returned. Does the contract require you to take the puppy for a vet visit within a set time? Does it cover hereditary issues for life? For only a certain period of time? What kind of documentation will you need to provide to “prove” your case? What does the breeder agree to offer? 100% money back? Trade for another puppy when one is available? Are there restrictions on the activities you can do with your dog that will invalidate the contract or guarantee? Are you purchasing a show prospect puppy or a pet quality animal? Does the breeder have strong feelings (or even bans) about the vaccinations, foods or supplements for your puppy? Are these opinions based on solid science?","response":"This article provides guidance on finding an ethical breeder for German Shepherd puppies and the importance of doing research before choosing a breeder. It suggests starting by looking for national breed clubs like the German Shepherd Dog Club of America or the American Kennel Club, which have detailed information on ethical breeders and local resources. Local breed clubs are beneficial in finding reputable breeders in one's area. Asking veterinarians and other dog professionals for recommendations is also advised. It's essential to find a breeder specializing in German Shepherds with years of experience. Good breeders focus on early socialization, introducing puppies to different people and experiences. Puppies should spend time in the breeders' homes, allowing them to become accustomed to human interaction. Ethical breeders only breed females who have reached sexual maturity (around two years old) and allow mothers to recover from pregnancy before breeding again. Puppies should not be sold before eight weeks of age. Ensure that puppies have started their vaccination and deworming processes.

They may ask questions about one's dog experience, lifestyle, or even turn potential owners away if not a good fit. Patience is essential in finding the right puppy, and one should not lie just to obtain a puppy. Avoid breeders who offer discounts, have unclean kennels, or demonstrate suspicious behavior. Dogs should have ample space, food, and water, and kennels should be clean. Reputable breeders should have a return policy for puppies if they don't work out with the new family. Important considerations include the contract's terms, what documentation comes with the puppy (registration and pedigree papers), and whether the breeder requires a vet visit within a specific time. It is important to discuss any potential issues that may arise, such as the health guarantee, restrictions, breeder's views on vaccinations, foods, or supplements."},{"question":"Q: Which of the following sentences is nonsensical?

A:","response":"As of 2022, both United States Senators from Maryland, Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, are members of the Democratic Party. Let's take a deeper look at these Senators and their political careers. 1. Chris Van Hollen: Van Hollen was elected as a United States Senator from Maryland in 2016. He has served the state of Maryland for many years, dating back to his time in the House of Representatives from 2003 to 2016. Prior to his congressional service, Van Hollen served in the Maryland State Legislature. Throughout his political career, Van Hollen has consistently been affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the Senate, Van Hollen has made a name for himself on key committees, such as the Appropriations Committee, the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Environment and Public Works Committee. These assignments reflect his policy interests in a range of areas, including budgetary affairs, finance, and environmental protection. 2. Ben Cardin: Cardin is the senior United States Senator from Maryland, having been in office since 2007. Before that, Cardin spent 20 years in the House of Representatives, and, like Van Hollen, Cardin served in the Maryland State Legislature prior to his time in Congress. He has also been a member of the Democratic Party throughout his political career. In the Senate, Cardin currently serves on the Finance Committee, Foreign Relations Committee, Environment and Public Works Committee and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. These assignments point to his policy interests in areas such as foreign affairs, small business issues, and environmental policy. In terms of their political ideologies, both Van Hollen and Cardin can be characterized as mainstream Democrats. They tend to support progressive policy objectives in areas such as healthcare, education, and the environment, while also advocating for stronger regulation of business practices, greater income equality, and civil rights protections. It's also worth noting that Maryland as a state tends to vote Democratic in presidential elections, indicating that Van Hollen and Cardin's Democratic Party affiliation is consistent with the state's broader political leaning. Remember, party affiliations can change so it's always good to check the current representation.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm.

For Putin, this crisis is only the latest in a catalog of grievances, says Chance. Putin's ultimate goal may be to tear up the post-Soviet assumptions about what Russia will tolerate, he says. Article:","response":"Title: Understanding the Solution to the Ukraine Crisis Hey kids! Today, we will learn about something important happening in the world: the Ukraine crisis. Now, don't worry if you don't understand what all the big words mean, I will explain them to you in a simple way so you can understand. First, let's talk about what the Ukraine crisis is. There is a country called Ukraine, and there is another big, powerful country nearby called Russia. Right now, the two countries are having a big disagreement. This is called a crisis because it's a difficult and dangerous time for the people living there. Now, there is a man named Matthew Chance, and he has an idea to help make things better. He thinks that one way to solve the problem is to promise that Ukraine will never join a special group of countries called NATO. You can think of NATO like a superhero team, and every country that is part of it helps to protect one another. Russia's leader, a man named Putin, doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO because he thinks that will cause more trouble. You see, Putin is not happy about many things that have happened in the past between Russia and other countries. This crisis with Ukraine is just one example of the many problems he has had. Matthew Chance believes that part of the reason Putin is causing this crisis is because he wants to change the way things have been since the time when the Soviet Union existed. The Soviet Union was a group of countries, including Russia, that acted kind of like a big family, but they don't exist anymore. Now, we have talked about a lot of big, complicated ideas, but remember, what we are trying to do is find a solution to make things better between Ukraine and Russia. By saying that Ukraine won't join the superhero team, NATO, it might make Putin feel better, and this could help solve the crisis. Sometimes, even big leaders need to hear that everything will be okay and they can still be in charge, just like how we sometimes need a hug or kind words from a friend when we're feeling sad or upset. In conclusion, the Ukraine crisis is a big problem involving two countries, Ukraine and Russia, who are having a big disagreement. Matthew Chance suggests a possible solution by telling Ukraine not to join NATO, the superhero team of countries. This might help Russia's leader, Putin, feel better and more in control. It might be hard to understand all of this, but it is important to learn about these things so that we can help make the world a better, safer place for everyone."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Louis S.

What company was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998?","response":"Google, the American technology company, was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998. Both were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California when they developed the idea to create a more efficient and innovative search engine. Their motivation stemmed from the realization that the existing search engines at the time were insufficient and unable to cope with the explosive growth of the internet. The concept behind Google's search engine was to use a unique algorithm called PageRank, which determined the importance of websites by measuring the number and quality of other pages linking to them. This not only facilitated more accurate search results, but it also made the process faster and more convenient for users. Their innovative technology quickly gained popularity, and its founders decided to incorporate the company as Google Inc. on September 4, 1998. The company's name is derived from the word \\"googol,\\" which is a mathematical term representing the numeral one followed by 100 zeros. This name embodies the founders' vision to organize the vast amount of information available on the internet. Over the years, Google has expanded its services to cater to a wide range of user needs. Some notable products and services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, and Google Photos, as well as the Android operating system for smartphones and tablets. Google is also behind the Chrome web browser, and its digital assistant, Google Assistant, competes with the likes of Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. Google's growth and influence have been staggering, transforming it from a simple search engine to an essential part of daily life for millions of people worldwide. In 2004, the company went public, and in 2015, Google restructured itself under a new umbrella company called Alphabet Inc. This move allowed for better management of its growing suite of products and services, as well as provided a clearer view of Google's various non-advertising revenue streams. Under Alphabet Inc., Google remains one of the most prominent technology companies in the world. Its commitment to continuous innovation has led to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, life sciences, and more. Despite facing regulatory challenges and criticisms about privacy and monopolistic practices, the company founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page has been able to maintain its dominance, redefine the way people access information, and leave its mark as an internet giant."},{"question":"Síntomas: muy fuertes dolores de cabeza en la región de la nuca, visión borrosa, vértigo que duraba varios segundos y sensación de cansancio que me acompañaba casi siempre. muy fuertes dolores de cabeza en la región de la nuca.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece, and emphasizing the drum and bass parts (this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a 'riddim'). Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo, reverb, panoramic delay, and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. Dub was pioneered by Osbourne \\"King Tubby\\" Ruddock, Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock (most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk), pop, hip hop, disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop.

Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - FIFA 06, also known as FIFA Soccer 06, is a video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts based on the game of football.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"What cell operatives arrived in the US shortly after May 2000?\\" Answer: \\"Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"I will explain it simply for you. After May 2000, some people from a group called the Hamburg cell went to the United States. They were part of a bigger group called al Qaeda.

Stop and listen on any other day of the week and all you’ll hear is the roar of 10 lanes of traffic. This sprawling megacity of 21 million is home to 5.5m cars, and that number is growing despite some of the worst traffic jams in the world. Residents spend an average of three hours a day commuting, and car speeds during rush hour have fallen to around 7.5mph (12km/h). Although air quality has improved markedly since the city was named the most polluted in the world in the 1980s, walking or cycling along one of its many multi-lane highways sometimes feels as if you are sucking directly on a car exhaust. For one day every week, though, people on bikes and on foot rule a decent stretch of road, for a few hours at least. The official Muévete en Bici (Move by Bike) event has been going since 2008 but was recently expanded to cover 35 miles (55km) of city streets. It’s not just for cyclists: many others jog with baby strollers, or enjoy free zumba classes, martial arts or Mexican wrestling displays. Some might dismiss the weekly car-free morning as a gimmick, but Reforma is also home to wide, protected cycle lanes along both sides, from the historic centre to the green oasis of Chapultepec park in the west. During rush hour these lanes see a constant stream of cyclists in work clothes, many of them using the Ecobici bike hire system – the fourth largest in the world after Huangzhou, Paris and London. It is used mainly by residents getting around the city, rather than by sightseeing tourists, and 37% of users are women. The city now has around 90 miles (150km) of dedicated bike lanes, and environment minister Tanya Müller last week announced two new protected cycle paths will be built along Revolución and Patriotismo avenues by February. A survey showed 4,000 cyclists a day already brave these high-speed, five-lane highways. Sitting in her modern office overlooking the Zócalo – the historic main square, ringed by a six-lane road – Müller says cycling plays a crucial role in her attempts to make the city more sustainable and helps to fight pollution, congestion and obesity. She has expanded the Ecobici network to more than 6,000 bikes at 444 stations, and users can now access the service using an integrated card that also covers the metro, bus rapid transport (BRT) and trolleybuses. In an effort to include the majority of residents who live on the outskirts of the city, the environment ministry has opened a 24-hour 400-space secure cycle parking facility at Pantitlán near the airport in the east, and another is being built in La Raza in the north. The idea is that people can cycle from home to the hub, take public transport into the centre and then use an Ecobici for the “last mile” to work. Another proposed cycle lane along División del Norte has been stalled for years after protests from the plumbing and building suppliers whose shops line the route who are worried it will damage trade. “The scheme is on hold but it will happen,” promises Müller. Trendy cycling cafes and shops are springing up in cooler parts of town like Condesa and Roma, where the pace of the city is slower and drivers are more used to seeing people on bikes, tending to give them more space. The last time an official survey into cycling was completed eight years ago it showed 1% of journeys across the metropolitan area were made by bike. Unofficial estimates now put that at around 2%. Bernardo Baranda of the ITDP, which works to help developing countries improve their transport systems, was one of a group of cyclists who helped start the grassroots Bicitekas organisation in the late 1990s after he returned from a period studying and working in the Netherlands. Inspired by the efforts of Bogotá mayor Enrique Peñalosa, in 1998 the collective started a weekly Paseo Nocturno, a Critical Mass-style ride where a group of cyclists meet up on a weeknight and take a four-hour trip around some of Mexico City’s busiest roads, staying safe through sheer force of numbers. It was revolutionary at the time but now the city hosts an official Paseo every Sunday and a government-organised night ride once a month on closed roads; last month’s for Day of the Dead attracted a record 95,000 cyclists. There are plenty of unofficial night rides, too, run by groups such as Mujeres en Bici and Paseo de Todos, as well as the original Bicitekas ride. A car can jump a red light in front of a police officer and he won’t do anything – the law is flexible in Mexico City Cycling activists galvanised around protests against the Segundo Piso in 2003 – a second tier to the city’s car-choked multi-lane Periférico ringroad – but it wasn’t until the arrival of Marcelo Ebrard as mayor that things began to change. His original 2007 target of 186 miles of cycle paths has still not been achieved, but he and environment minister Martha Delgado started the official Sunday rides, built the bike lane along Reforma and launched Ecobici. There is a feeling among activists that, while Müller and current mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera are working in the right direction, they are nowhere near as radical. Cycling with Baranda on some of the city’s protected cycle lanes it is soon clear that a bike is a quicker way to get around than a car, especially on journeys under three miles (5km). For the most part, concrete and heavy-duty plastic dividers keep the traffic at bay, although when they are replaced by reflectors in the road in the run-up to a junction some drivers simply swing into the bike lane. I soon learn to be incredibly cautious every time the bike lane passes a side road, as cars from behind will happily pull alongside and try to turn right across your path. Venture away from the cycle lanes and it quickly feels more aggressive. Baranda would like to say cycling here is safe, but last year suffered his first serious accident in two decades when he was overtaken by a truck and a ladder poking out of the side caught him on the back of the head. The driver didn’t stop and Baranda spent a month in a neck brace. He’s now back out on his bike. Around 1,200 people are killed on Mexico City’s roads every year. Of these 60% are pedestrians, but it is not clear how many are cyclists. A third of accidents involve speeding cars. Baranda would like to see more protected bike lanes but is hopeful a new traffic law, about to come into force, will make cycling safer. Speed limits are being cut to 30mph (50km/h) on main roads and 20mph (30km/h) on side streets, cyclists will be allowed to proceed through red lights if the way is clear, and the city government will put the needs of pedestrians first, followed by cyclists, then public transport, cargo and finally private cars and motorbikes. But the tougher traffic laws will only work if the police make them work. “You need consequences for bad driving,” says Baranda. “The police need to enforce the law.” That point is echoed by Agustín Martinez, the president of the Bicitekas collective. “Not everyone is studying traffic law like we are – drivers need to be educated and we need enforcement. A car can jump a red light right in front of a traffic police officer and he won’t do anything – the law is very flexible in Mexico City.” Related: Should cyclists be allowed to run red lights? I ask about a white ghost bike I spotted on the way to the Bicitekas HQ. One of the group explains how a young female cyclist was hit by a car and knocked unconscious. When she got up and her boyfriend started remonstrating with the driver, he drove off with the woman clinging to the bonnet, accelerating and swerving until she fell off. She died of her injuries in hospital. The driver was tracked down by police but, says the activist, was freed after a few well-placed bribes: “When he was caught he said, ‘I have money, I have power, nothing will happen’ – he was right.” Martinez is pleased with the new traffic law but disappointed with what he sees as the lack of recent progress. “We have a lot of friends in the city government now and we thought everything would change,” he says. “But it’s hard, their hands are tied. [The city government] is scared of the car lobby, they defend old ideas like cheap gasoline, they are scared of business and they don’t think about the people that live here. It’s all about money.” There’s no doubt that Mexico City is for the most part still a car-orientated city but it is also clear that cycling is in the ascendancy. “It used to be that people saw cycling here as something eccentric or crazy,” says Baranda. “People thought that if you cycled you must be a tree-hugger or not have enough money to get a car, but that’s changed now – now it’s trendy.” What is your experience of cycling in Mexico City, and how could it be improved?

What is the correct answer to this question?","response":"The correct answer to this question is that the male gametes in humans are produced by the testes (also known as testicles or gonads), which are the primary male reproductive organs. The testes are a pair of oval-shaped structures located in the scrotum, a pouch of skin hanging below the penis. The primary function of the testes is to produce sperm cells, or male gametes, and hormones, mainly testosterone. Testosterone plays a critical role in the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics. Spermatogenesis, the process of sperm production, occurs in the seminiferous tubules within the testes. Each testis contains numerous seminiferous tubules, where the germ cells differentiate into mature sperm cells. This process begins with spermatogonia, which are undifferentiated male germ cells, and continues through various stages of development, including primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. Finally, mature spermatozoa are formed. They are then released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. The mature spermatozoa then travel from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis, a coiled tube next to each testis, where they undergo further maturation and gain mobility. During ejaculation, sperm are propelled from the epididymis through the vas deferens, a muscular tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. Along the way, secretions from accessory glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands mix with the sperm to form semen, which is eventually expelled through the penis during ejaculation. In summary, the testes are the structures responsible for producing male gametes in humans. Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules within each testis, with sperm cells going through several stages of development before becoming mature spermatozoa. These spermatozoa subsequently travel through the male reproductive system, ultimately exiting the body during ejaculation as part of semen."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

Camping is an outdoor recreational activity where people set up a shelter, usually a tent or caravan, and spend one or more nights in a natural environment away from their usual residence. Camping typically involves activities such as hiking, fishing, campfires, and enjoying nature. Now, let's analyze the connection between camping and overacting and exaggerated movements: 1. Overacting usually refers to an excessive portrayal of emotions or actions, which is more commonly associated with theater or dramatic performances rather than outdoor activities like camping. 2. Exaggerated movements can sometimes be related to physical activities, but these are not a requirement for camping. Based on this analysis, the statement \\"Camping involves overacting and exaggerated movements\\" is not true. Although exaggerated movements may occur in some physical camping activities, they are not an inherent part of camping, and overacting seems unrelated to the camping experience."},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Unable to face the fact that her less intelligent male protege, Frank Peterson (Tim Daly), has now become her boss, she quits and tries to start up her own company only to find out that the male dominated world of Wall Street is not interested in taking an African American woman seriously, and thus is forced to create a fictional white man, Robert S. Cutty (inspired by a bottle of Cutty Sark) in order to be judged on her own merits. Ayres' financial wisdom is joined by the intelligent and computer-savvy secretary Sally Dugan (Dianne Wiest), who also was not properly recognized for her talents. Together they are able to become the most successful independent stockbrokers in the world while helping a struggling high-tech computer company stay afloat. However, the ruse eventually runs into problems, as Cutty is still getting credit for Ayres' great ideas, and competing firms and tabloid journalists are willing to do anything in order to bring the wealthy and elusive Cutty into the public and on their side. Thus Ayres is forced to get her best friend (who works at a nightclub as a female impersonator) to create an effective disguise in the mould of Marlon Brando to try to fool the naysayers; when that fails, she and Dugan decide to kill Cutty only to be charged with his murder. Frank uncovers the ruse and pretends that he is now the front man to world-famous Cutty. The film ends with Ayres donning the Cutty disguise one last time to attend a meeting of the exclusive gentlemen's club to accept Cutty's awards and unmasking herself in order to teach the male-dominated industry the evils of racial and sexual discrimination. Ayres is finally given credit for her work and creates a huge business empire with her friends at the helm. Frank attempts to land a job with the business, only to be laughed off. Answer:","response":"Laurel proves that despite facing racial and gender discrimination, talent and determination can lead to success. By creating a fictional white man, Robert S. Cutty, and disguising herself as him, she is able to overcome obstacles and demonstrate her skills without bias. The movie shows that if given the opportunity, anyone, regardless of race or gender, can excel in their chosen field and contribute positive impacts on society. Additionally, the movie emphasizes the importance of recognizing and valuing the skills of individuals based on their merits rather than their background."},{"question":"Depending on your style, this step can vary a lot but the basics are this: Take showers regularly and brush your teeth. Those are the absolute basics, but they will still go a long way in improving your chances of getting that special girl’s attention. No one wants to cuddle up to a dude who smells like B.O. and has breakfast stockpiled in his teeth. Bust out that body wash and invest in a great toothbrush. Beyond the basics, there are a lot of ways that guys can groom themselves so that they look their best. Hair mousse can turn your fuzzy bedheaded look into a subtly sculpted thing of beauty. Don’t put gobs of mousse on your head though--grease hair can be a turn off for some girls. If you’re rocking a beard, keep it in check. Some women really dig facial hair, but even the manliest of beards can go the way of Rip Van Winkle’s absurdly long beard if they are not properly maintained. Invest in a beard trimmer. Aside from beard sculpting, take a good look at the rest of your body hair. Pluck that unibrow, clip those nose hairs, and keep any ear hair you might have to a minimum. Most girls--even ones that love beards--balk at excessive hair in other places besides your chin, chest, and more private parts. Clip your nails. Girls often notice hands, so make sure yours don’t look like they might belong to Big Foot. Cut off those talons and scrape any dirt out from under your nails. Moisturize. While this may seem like an unmanly thing to do, when you have the girl of your dreams on your arm, you will not want that arm to be dry and flakey. Use lotion to give your skin a softness that she won’t be able to resist touching. Everyone has their own style, and that is completely fine, but its really best to avoid the ‘slob’ style. Don’t wear sweatpants every day of the week, and try to change your shirt before heading out of your house each day. Apart from that, try to keep in mind that girls like when guys put a bit of effort into their look, even if that just means throwing on a stylish flannel, tightish pants, and a pair of rocking thick-rimmed glasses (see How to be a Hipster.) If you are trying a catch a gal’s eye who happens to work at your place of employment, try to play up your professionalism. Invest in some classy suits and some great ties. If you don’t know how to do that, enlist the help of your best girl friend. Posture plays a big part in how women perceive guys. If a guy is hunched over in a corner, avoiding eye contact and not talking with anyone, they are most likely not going to walk over and start a conversation. Stand up straight, make eye contact, and smile. Keep in mind that you want to have good posture, but you don’t want to make it weirdly obvious that you’re standing up super straight. Carry yourself with ease. If you don’t know how to carry yourself with ease, look at your role models. Watch lead guys in movies who manage to charm their ways into the lead girls’ hearts. Keep her body language in mind too. If she's shifting her weight a lot and not making eye contact, she's probably uncomfortable. It may be the conversation topic, how close you are standing or sitting next to her, or something else. Respect her feelings, and change the subject or step back, if necessary, depending on what is bothering her. While you are probably a great guy, it is important to remember that some girls really like guys who work out. Plus, the gym is a great place to catch the attention of that special girl. If you want to attract that drop dead gorgeous girl you’ve been crushing on, you have to keep your physique in good condition too. Start an exercise routine that includes cardio and weight training so that you can both buff up your muscles, and get in incredible shape. Keep in mind that most women like a toned guy, but are not attracted to a dude who looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was Mr. Universe. If you are having a hard time raising your hand in class because your muscles are about to rip through your shirt, it may be time to tone the weight-lifting down a bit. Summary:","response":"To attract a girl, there are several factors to consider: 1. Maintain personal hygiene: Shower regularly, brush your teeth, and keep yourself smelling good with the help of body wash, deodorant, and a quality toothbrush. 2. Groom yourself: Take care of your hair with hair products, trim your beard, pluck any unibrow, clip long nails, and so on. 3. Dress well: Avoid the \\"slob\\" look and opt for a stylish approach that suits your personality. Dress professionally if you're trying to catch a co-worker's eye. 4. Posture and body language: Stand up straight, make eye contact, and carry yourself with ease. Pay attention to her body language and comfort level. 5. Exercise regularly: Work on your physique by incorporating a mix of cardio and weight training. But remember, most women prefer a toned body rather than a bulked-up look. Overall, demonstrate confidence and genuine care for your appearance."},{"question":"Q:Given the background: Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. and the situation: Rob got a compass as a present for his birthday. The magnet in the compass made him very interested in how magnets work. To understand magnets better he categorized objects in two groups, group A and group B. In group A all objects were magnetic, but in group B none of the objects was magnetic. Answer the following question: Which group's objets might include paper or plastic, group A or group B?

В автономном аспекте искусства, который является частью его \\"двойственного характера\\", Франкфуртские теоретики увидели параллель с несгибаемостью критической теории. Согласно данному подходу, искусство обладает как социальными, так и автономными функциями. С одной стороны, искусство выражает основные ценности и идеи культуры, в которой оно было создано, а с другой стороны, искусство является самодостаточной системой, не зависящей от внешних воздействий. Критическая теория, разрабатываемая Франкфуртской школой, стремилась раскрыть и обозначить социальные, политические и экономические противоречия и процессы, которые мешали развитию свободного и равноправного общества. Эта теория носит противостоящий характер, так как критикует господствующие системы власти и культурные нормы. Таким образом, несгибаемость критической теории проявляется в ее стремлении выявлять и анализировать социальные проблемы и процессы независимо от принятых видений и условий. Сходство между автономным аспектом искусства и несгибаемостью критической теории заключается в том, что обе сферы демонстрируют самостоятельность от традиционных догм и структур. Искусство, как и критическая теория, основывается на самостоятельном мышлении и анализе, что позволяет им избегать ограничений, наложенных традиционными идеологиями и культурными нормами. В этом смысле, автономный аспект искусства и противостоящая природа критической теории являются ключевыми компонентами их эффективности и способности к инновациям. Они способствуют более глубокому пониманию мира и человеческих ценностей, открывая новые горизонты для исследования и развития культуры и общества."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: 2012 UEFA Europa League Final Russian:","response":"Финал Лиги Европы УЕФА 2012 года"},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Despite being one of the smallest countries in Africa, it has a large population, which has been steadily increasing over the years. As of 2021, the population of Rwanda is estimated to be around 13 million people. This marks a significant increase from the 1994 figure of about 7.95 million, a year that saw Rwanda devastated by a horrific genocide. Consequently, population growth has been an essential aspect of the country's recovery and rebuilding process. The population density in Rwanda is one of the highest in Africa, with approximately 525 people per square kilometer. The nation's urban population is relatively low, with approximately 18% of the people living in urban areas. The capital city, Kigali, is the largest and most populous city, accounting for around 1.2 million residents. Most Rwandans belong to one of three main ethnic groups: Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa. The Hutu ethnic group comprises about 85% of the population, while the Tutsi and Twa account for 14% and 1%, respectively. Though ethnic tensions played a significant role in the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan government has since implemented policies and campaigns to promote unity and reconciliation among these groups. The official languages of Rwanda are Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Swahili, with Kinyarwanda being the most common language spoken among the people. The literacy rate has been improving, with the current rate standing at approximately 73%. Rwanda's population has a relatively young age structure, with about 60% of the people under the age of 25. This presents challenges in terms of education and employment opportunities but also provides the nation with a potentially vibrant workforce for future economic growth. The life expectancy in Rwanda has been increasing as well, currently standing at around 69 years for both males and females. The Rwandan government has been emphasizing economic growth and development in the country, focusing primarily on sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and information technology. The population growth comes with the need to provide adequate resources, including education, healthcare, and job opportunities for the Rwandan people. To sum up, Rwanda's population has been steadily growing in the past few decades despite its history of conflict and tragedy. The country's government has made strides in fostering unity among ethnic groups and investing in economic growth to ensure the wellbeing of its citizens. Continued progress in healthcare, education, and economic sectors will be crucial for Rwanda's future development and the welfare of its people."},{"question":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: The new husband should not think of this wedding night as a night of sensual pleasure – but a night of LOVE!","response":"To remove the spaces from the given sentence, I will go through the sentence character by character, and when I encounter a space, I will not include it in the output.

While Brett was more focused on socializing and enjoying the party scene, Matthew was the complete opposite, dedicating himself to his academic pursuits without fail. Step 1: Establish their differing priorities This contrast between their personalities highlighted the fact that they each had a different set of priorities. Brett believed in living in the moment, attending parties, and enjoying his youth. In contrast, Matthew felt that his college years were an opportunity to advance his future career prospects and dedicated the majority of his time to getting a solid education. Step 2: Explore the consequences of their choices As college progressed, the consequences of their choices began to manifest. Brett's grades started declining due to his constant partying, while Matthew maintained a stellar academic record. Despite their differences, they remained friends and occasionally attempted to influence each other's habits. Matthew would try to convince Brett to pay more attention to his studies, while Brett would coax Matthew into attending a party or two. Step 3: Show how they influenced each other Through the years, they both influenced each other in subtle ways. Brett helped Matthew to realize the importance of having a social life and creating memorable experiences outside of his academic obligations. On the other hand, Matthew's disciplined approach to his studies prompted Brett to put more effort into his college work, improving his own academic performance to some extent. Step 4: Describe the outcome of their college experience As graduation approached, both Brett and Matthew had experienced growth, not just in their respective academics or social lives, but also as individuals. They had learned valuable lessons from one another, which they would carry with them beyond their college years. Matthew had learned to have a better balance in his life, making time for leisure activities and socializing while still excelling academically. Meanwhile, Brett acknowledged the importance of maintaining a good work ethic in achieving his goals. Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet moment for both of them, as they looked back on their journey together and prepared to face the next chapter of their lives. In conclusion, Brett and Matthew's contrasting college experiences resulted in mutual growth and self-improvement. Through their opposing approaches to college life, they discovered the value of balance between academics and social interactions and developed lifelong skills that would serve them well in their future endeavors."},{"question":"The UN Security Council is due to vote on a draft resolution calling on Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon and respect Lebanese sovereignty.

But Mr Abbott's future as prime minister remains in doubt after 39 of his own MPs voted for the spill in the secret party room ballot. A majority of the Liberal backbench is thought to have voted against the prime minister, with the vote count totalling 61 votes to 39. The vote count is considered so dire for Mr Abbott because there was no direct challenger for his leadership. In a recorded statement released following the vote, Mr Abbott said: 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us.' 'We are absolutely determined to work for you, the people.' Scroll down for video. Relieved: Mr Abbott enjoys a moment of peace during a press conference this afternoon. He survived a leadership motion, telling reporters: 'Good government starts today' While Mr Abbott expressed contrition about his performance in recent weeks, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today revelled in the prime minister's misfortune, questioning whether he had the mandate to remain leader. Isolation: Prime Minister Tony Abbott, pictured in Parliament, was deserted by 39 of his colleagues who voted against the spill. Leadership murmurs: Mr Abbott was not opposed by any of his colleagues, including Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The pair are pictured sharing a moment on the floor of Parliament today. Discussion: Mr Abbott is now formulating plans on how his team can claw back support in the polls. Survivor: Mr Abbott has survived the threat to his leadership, but 39 of his own MPs voted against his leadership. The victor: Prime Minister Tony Abbott walks from the party room after a majority of his backbench voted against his leadership. Mr Abbott is due to give his first statement to the media following the vote shortly. At a press conference later, Mr Abbott conceded the government had been having a difficult time recently, citing the Queensland election result that delivered a massive swing against the Liberals. 'Who wouldn't be nervous after watching the result in Queensland,' he said. 'So all of us are determined to lift our game and the fundamental point I make is that the solution to all of these things is good government. 'And good government starts today.' Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting on Monday morning flanked by a large throng of supporters. Malcolm Turnbull - his potential leadership rival - was not one of them, sidling into the meeting on his own. Mr Turnbull has remained coy about his position and has not publicly challenged the leader. Today's vote was instigated by rebellious backbenchers, who revolted following his controversial decision to knight Prince Philip and the disastrous defeat of Campbell Newman's Liberal National government in Queensland two weeks ago. Mr Abbott faced more grim news this morning, with a Newspoll commissioned by the Australian newspaper finding that more than 68 per cent of voters are dissatisfied with his performance. Worse, the Newspoll figures revealed Mr Turnbull was by far the preferred Liberal Party leader, with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing Mr Abbott. On a two-party preferred basis, Labor led the Coalition by 14 points, 57 points to 43. The poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a Prime Minister in more than 20 years, comparable only to Paul Keating in 1994. Mr Abbott began today with a visit to a Canberra church. It was a traditional service held at the beginning of each parliamentary sitting year. He told reporters afterwards that the government would 'get on with being the government we were elected to be' following the vote. Contrast: Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting accompanied by his deputy leader, Julie Bishop and a huge column of supporters. On his own: Malcolm Turnbull arrived to today's party room meeting without any supporters in tow. Cheeky stunt: Labor bigwigs Bill Shorten (centre), Tanya Plibersek and Penny Wong swept by the assembled media after buying coffees. Time to pray: Mr Abbott appeared with his wife, Margie, at a traditional church service prior to the beginning of the year's first sitting week of Parliament. After grim polling this morning, Mr Abbott is facing one of the most critical tests of his leadership in the form of a spill motion this morning. Tony Abbott and his family spent time in Sydney's China Town on Sunday afternoon after he had announced the spill motion would take place in Canberra on Monday. Tony Abbott claims he has moved the spill motion forward because, 'the last thing Australia needs right now is instability'. However, others believe he made the decision to avoid an awkward question time on Monday. Senior Liberal figure Arthur Sinodinos has said he is very disappointed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to move the spill motion forward to Monday, and revealed he will vote in favour of a spill. The most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the former chief of staff to Prime Minister John Howard. 'I believe it will help precipitate a discussion', Senator Sinodinos told Fairfax Media on Sunday. He said he was 'very disappointed' with the Prime Minister's decision to move the spill forward from Tuesday to Monday. He said: 'MPs should be given time to discuss the matter at hand. Tuesday is the time to do that.' Treasurer Joe Hockey has said any Cabinet minister who supports the Liberal leadership spill motion should resign. Mr Hockey said he expected all cabinet members to reject the spill motion, but if they supported it they should declare their hand now. 'If I disagreed with the prime minister and if I believed he wasn't the best person to lead the team I would step down from the cabinet - that is the appropriate thing to do,' he told Sky News on Sunday. He said he trusted his Cabinet colleagues Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop. 'If you are going to be disloyal to someone, you should front them,' Mr Hockey said. He expected the motion would be voted down, but not unanimously. 'There will always be a third of the party room that are upset about one thing or another,' he said. The treasurer rejected media reports that he could lose his job in a compromise to head off the leadership spill. 'I think everyone should do the jobs they have and properly serve the Australian people, not engage in commentary on gossip.' Mr Hockey stood by the government's controversial decisions to overhaul Medicare, higher education, pensions and welfare, which have contributed to the leadership unrest. 'We have no choice,' he said of the budget changes. Queensland MP Wyatt Roy, 24, has also declared that he will vote in favour of the motion to spill the leadership of the government. Wyatt (left) is pictured with Abbott in 2010. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to Sydney on Sunday. Mr Turnbull has only voiced his opposition to Mr Abbott moving the vote forward, labelling it a 'captain's call' - what the prime minister has dubbed some of his less popular decisions, including knighting Prince Philip. Mr Turnbull said anyone was in a position to contest the leadership without being disloyal. 'If, for whatever reason, the leadership of a political party is vacant then any member of the party can stand, whether they be a minister or a backbencher, without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant,' he said outside his home on Sunday. On Sunday Mr Abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line 'as quickly as possible' so the Liberal party can put the matter behind them. 'The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister,' he said. 'Now obviously I've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up Labor's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.' Turnbull has refused to deny he will challenge the Prime Minister for leadership of the Liberal party, and said if anyone stands for a vacant position that does not mean they are disrespecting the person whose leadership has been declared vacant. Malcolm Turnbull refused to say if he will run for the leadership but maintains he supports Mr Abbott in line with cabinet solidarity. As Prime Minister Tony Abbott battles to secure the backing of his own party members amidst next week's leadership spill motion, a new Galaxy poll has revealed that 55 per cent of voters want him to stand down. As reports that Malcolm Turnbull will contest the leadership continue to circulate, the poll showed he would improve the Liberal's chance of winning at the next election if he were made Prime Minister. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is also preferred as leader when measured up against Mr Abbott, but still not as much as a Labor government according to the 53:47 two-party preferred vote focused on her taking the top spot. There may be some hope yet for Mr Abbott, as sources reveal Mr Turnbull would offer him his support on Tuesday if he were to be promised the role of Treasurer, dumping Joe Hockey (pictured) from the position. The Communications Minister took to Twitter this week to deny he was in secret meetings with deputy leader Julie Bishop. He also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so he will take that as an endorsement of his leadership. Ms Bishop said as Mr Abbott's deputy, she supported the prime minister. Luke Simpkins, pictured with potential leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull, has announced he will move for a federal Liberal leadership spill.

The \\"contract\\" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.\\" Answer: A:","response":"In the context of the Second Punic War, Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods, was promised every animal born that spring as an extraordinary sacrifice due to the critical situation Rome was facing against Hannibal and his allies. This unusual offering, known as \\"ver sacrum,\\" was made to seek divine protection and assistance in overcoming the enemies in the war. The \\"contract\\" with Jupiter was meticulously detailed to ensure that the gods and the Romans upheld their respective obligations. The Romans pledged to take proper care of the animals and stated that any animals that died or were stolen before the sacrifice would still count as already consecrated, acknowledging Jupiter's ownership. Under normal circumstances, if the gods failed to fulfill their part of the agreement (in this case, providing protection from Hannibal), Romans would withhold the sacrifice. Instances of withheld sacrifice are recorded during the Imperial period; for example, after Emperor Trajan's death, since the gods had not kept him safe for the agreed-upon period. This practice of animal sacrifice demonstrates the Romans' deep-rooted faith in establishing a reciprocal relationship with their deities. It was believed that by making these offerings, the gods would grant protection and assistance in return. In the context of the imperial period, it was also common for the Genius (protective spirit) of the living emperor to be offered a bull, though smaller offerings such as incense and wine were made as well."},{"question":"Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: ice pick Options are: [i] can hit a ball ball ; [ii] can throw a ball ;","response":"None of the given options are suitable for the goal of an ice pick.

Where is likely to have a popular delicatessen? Options: - city center - mall - shop - michigan - large city If the answer is 'large city'; explain the reasoning:","response":"The answer is 'large city.' Reasoning: A popular delicatessen is more likely to be located in a large city for several reasons: 1. Population: A large city has a higher population, which means more potential customers. This higher demand for different food options can support specialty shops like a delicatessen. 2. Diversity: Large cities tend to be more culturally diverse, promoting an interest in various food types. This increased exposure to different cuisines can create demand for a popular delicatessen offering unique food items. 3. Higher disposable income: People living in large cities may have higher disposable income, allowing them to spend more money on specialty items and experiences, such as a visit to a delicatessen. 4. Tourism: Large cities often attract more tourists, who seek unique experiences and food choices during their travels. A popular delicatessen can become a destination for these tourists, contributing to its success. While city centers, malls, and shops may also have popular delicatessens in some cases, the presence of a large city offers a combination of these elements that makes it the most likely location for a highly frequented delicatessen."},{"question":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning? It was built in the 14th century and had until the 17th century . It was built in the 17th century and had in the 14th century . Pick your answer from: * no * yes","response":"* no These two sentences do not have the same meaning. They express different historical timeframes for the construction and duration of the subject in question. The first sentence, \\"It was built in the 14th century and had until the 17th century,\\" implies that the structure or object was constructed in the 14th century and continued to exist or remained in use until the 17th century. This indicates a definite timeline, starting in the 14th century and ending in the 17th century. The second sentence, \\"It was built in the 17th century and had in the 14th century,\\" does not follow a clear timeline and appears to have a misplaced phrase. It states that the structure or object was built in the 17th century, but then inaccurately refers to the 14th century. If the intent was to express that an earlier version of the structure or object existed in the 14th century, a more appropriate phrasing would be, \\"It was built in the 17th century and had an earlier version in the 14th century.\\" Even with this rephrased sentence, it still has a different meaning than the first one, as it refers to two distinct versions of the subject rather than a continuous timeframe. In conclusion, based on the information given in the two sentences, they do not share the same meaning. This is primarily due to the different historical timeframes referenced and the unclear timeline in the second sentence."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the question \\"What does Mr. Henry Stone do?\\" and the answer \\"A writer.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

Some thinking first:","response":"In this scenario, the premise is \\"A man in an alley with his mule,\\" and the hypothesis is \\"A guy feeding a mule in an alley.\\" To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to analyze whether the hypothesis accurately represents the given information or adds extra details that might not be necessarily true. Premise: \\"A man in an alley with his mule\\" - This statement simply tells us that there is a man in an alley accompanied by his mule. It does not provide information about what the man or the mule is doing. Hypothesis: \\"A guy feeding a mule in an alley\\" - This statement gives us more information about what the man (or \\"guy\\") is doing in the alley: He is feeding the mule. In conclusion, we cannot definitively claim that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because the premise does not provide any information about the man's actions (e.g., feeding the mule). The hypothesis adds extra details that were not present in the original premise. It might be possible that the hypothesis is true, but we cannot confirm it based solely on the information provided in the premise."},{"question":"Amanda charges 20.00 per hour to help clean out and organize a person's home.

Use a clean spoon: Make sure the spoon you are using is clean and dry. 2.

This will create a protective layer between the spoon and the dough, preventing it from sticking. 3. Use a spoon with a non-stick coating: Some spoons have a special non-stick coating that helps to prevent the dough from sticking. If you have one, use it instead of a regular spoon. 4. Wet or flour your hands: Before touching the dough, wet your hands with water or cover them with flour.

He is noted for bringing Notre Dame's Fighting Irish football program from years of futility back into a national contender in 1964 and is widely regarded alongside Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy as a part of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of Notre Dame head coaches. Parseghian grew up in Akron, Ohio, and played football beginning in his junior year of high school. He enrolled at the University of Akron, but soon quit to join the U.S. Navy for two years during World War II. Context: In 1966, Parseghian guided Notre Dame to its first national championship since the Leahy era. Led by quarterback Terry Hanratty, running back Nick Eddy, star receiver Jim Seymour, and fullback Larry Conjar, the offense was best in the nation in scoring, with an average of 36.2 points per game. The defense was second in the country in points allowed, thanks to strong performances by linebacker Jim Lynch and defensive end Alan Page. The season began with eight straight victories, propelling Notre Dame to the top of the national polls. The team then faced Michigan State (who had Bubba Smith), which ranked second in the polls and was also undefeated. The contest, one among a number referred to as the \\"game of the century\\", ended in a 10-10 tie. Parseghian was criticized for winding down the clock instead of trying to score despite having the ball in the final seconds of the game. He defended his strategy by maintaining that several key starters had been knocked out of action early in the game and that he did not want to spoil a courageous comeback from a 10-0 deficit by risking a turnover deep in his own territory late in the game. When Parseghian's team trounced USC 51-0 the following week, critics alleged that he ran up the score to impress poll voters who had split the number-one ranking between Notre Dame and Michigan State following the tie. Subsequent to the USC rout, the final wire service polls gave Parseghian's team the national championship, although Notre Dame did not participate in a post-season bowl game. Nine members of the team were selected as All-Americans, and Parseghian was named coach of the year by Sporting News. Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did not repeat as national champion in the late 1960s. In 1969, the team finished with an 8-2-1 record and accepted an invitation to play in the postseason Cotton Bowl. With this game, the school ended a long-standing policy of not playing in bowl games. The university urgently needed money to fund minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from bowl games for this purpose. Parseghian's team lost the game, 21-17, to the eventual national champion Texas Longhorns. Question: What was the score in the michigan state game?

Mrs. Tingle has a special dislike for Leigh Ann and down-grades Leigh Ann's well-designed project. The teacher also stumbles upon Leigh Ann with the final exam, which had been stolen and planted in Leigh Ann's backpack without her consent, and threatens to have her expelled for it.Leigh Ann and her two friends, Luke (Barry Watson) and Jo Lynn (Marisa Coughlan), head to Mrs. Tingle's house that night and try to convince the teacher that Leigh Ann is innocent. Mrs. Tingle, however, does not listen. A physical struggle ensues and Mrs. Tingle is accidentally knocked unconscious. The students panic and tie Mrs. Tingle to her bed. Pretending to be Mrs. Tingle, Jo Lynn calls the school the next morning and feigns illness in order to buy themselves some time, but all are unsure of what they should do next. Mrs. Tingle eventually reveals that she hates Leigh Ann because Leigh Ann has the potential to leave their small town and experience life something Mrs. Tingle never got a chance to do but her honesty only furthers her captors' dislike of her.

Once the substances trypsin and chymotrypsin have broken down the proteins in the stomach into smaller chains of amino acids, other pancreatic enzymes such as amylase and lipase work on the carbohydrates and fats, respectively. This action further breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. As digestion progresses, the resulting smaller molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream. The increased glucose triggers the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that signals body cells to absorb glucose from the bloodstream for energy, glycogen synthesis, or conversion to fat. Simultaneously, the amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerol are absorbed by cells as building blocks for new proteins and fats, as well as for generating energy. Lastly, the pancreas also secretes another hormone called glucagon when necessary. Glucagon works in opposition to insulin, signaling the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream if blood sugar levels drop too low. This intricate system involving insulin and glucagon maintains a proper energy balance and ensures stable blood sugar levels within the body. In summary, the last step in the process involves the body regulating blood sugar levels through hormones insulin and glucagon and the absorption of nutrients like amino acids, fatty acids, and simple sugars into body cells for growth, repair, and energy production. This intricate balance is essential for maintaining overall health and homeostasis for optimal bodily function."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text.

Option A: 15 m West Option B: 30 m East Option C: 35 m East Option D: 45 m East Option E: 40 m East A:","response":"First, let's trace Rasik's path step by step. 1. Rasik walked 20m towards North. Let's consider this as point A(starting position) to point B. 2. Turned right (to the East) and walked 30m, reaching point C. 3. Turned right again (going South) and walked 35m, reaching point D. 4. Turned left (going East) and walked 15m, reaching point E. 5. Turned left again (going North) and walked 15m, reaching point F. Now, let's figure out the net displacement (horizontal and vertical) of Rasik from his starting position (point A). - Horizontally (East - West), Rasik moved 30m (from A to C) and another 15m (from D to E) in the east direction, totaling 45m towards East. - Vertically (North - South), Rasik moved 20m (from A to B) towards North and 35m (from C to D) towards South. So the net displacement is 20m North - 35m South = 15m towards South. So, Rasik is 45m East and 15m South from the starting position. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the starting position (A) and the final position (F). Distance = √(Horizontal Displacement^2 + Vertical Displacement^2) Distance = √(45^2 + 15^2) Distance = √(2025 + 225) Distance = √2250 The direction is South-East. However, there is no option given with South-East direction.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having less limestone under the soil can have an indirect effect on the photosynthesis process and consequently on the carbon dioxide levels. Limestone, primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), plays a crucial role in maintaining the pH level and supplying essential nutrients, such as calcium, for plant growth. A decrease in limestone availability can lead to the following effects on the photosynthesis process: 1. Soil acidity: A reduction in limestone can result in an increase in soil acidity. Acidic soil can reduce the availability of essential nutrients required for plant growth such as phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. This can limit plant growth and indirectly affect the photosynthesis process, as the plants might not receive the necessary nutrients to function optimally. 2. Calcium deficiency: Calcium is an important nutrient for plants, as it is involved in cell wall formation and helps in the transportation of other nutrients within the plant. A lack of calcium can lead to improper functioning of cells, which may hinder photosynthesis. Additionally, calcium indirectly affects the opening and closing of stomata (the pores through which carbon dioxide enters and oxygen exits the leaf). A deficiency of calcium could impair the proper functioning of stomata, affecting the overall photosynthesis process. 3. Plant stress: Plants under stress due to nutrient deficiencies may prioritize their resources to other survival functions, rather than focusing on photosynthesis. This could further lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide consumption and an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the environment. In conclusion, while having less limestone under the soil does not directly affect the photosynthesis process, it can lead to indirect consequences by disrupting nutrient availability and plant growth. This can eventually impact carbon dioxide uptake and oxygen release."},{"question":"Text: As the governing body of association football, FIFA is responsible for maintaining and implementing the rules that determine whether an association football player is eligible to represent a particular country in officially recognised international competitions and friendly matches. In the 20th century, FIFA allowed a player to represent any national team, as long as the player held citizenship of that country. In 2004, in reaction to the growing trend towards naturalisation of foreign players in some countries, FIFA implemented a significant new ruling that requires a player to demonstrate a \`\`clear connection'' to any country they wish to represent. FIFA has used its authority to overturn results of competitive international matches that feature ineligible players. Question: do you have to be a citizen of a country to play in the world cup?","response":"Yes, to play in the World Cup for a country, you must be a citizen of that country. FIFA, the organization that makes the rules for football, changed the rules in 2004. Now, a player must have a \\"clear connection\\" to the country they want to represent.

Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. Now, I have a new situation: Bob and Andy were two nature enthusiasts. They went camping together once a month. Bob was into bird watching, while Andy was fascinated with frogs and salamanders. They went on a trip last week-end and they were very happy with what they had observed.

Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","response":"The answer to this question would be an entity, specifically referring to an ethnic group. The Polynesian people that inhabit New Zealand are known as the Māori. The Māori are the indigenous people of New Zealand who have a rich culture, history, and traditions. They comprise a significant portion of the country's population and play an important role in shaping its social, cultural, and political landscape. Māori people arrived in New Zealand from the mythical homeland of Hawaiki, according to historical and oral traditions. Archaeological evidence suggests that they arrived by voyaging across the Pacific in canoes around 1250–1300 CE. Over the centuries, they developed a distinct identity and culture that became deeply intertwined with the land, known as Aotearoa in the Māori language. Māori society is organized around a social structure known as whānau (extended family) and hapū (subtribe or clan), which form part of the larger iwi (tribal) affiliations. These connections are essential for maintaining the Māori sense of identity and belonging. The Māori language, Te Reo Māori, is an Eastern Polynesian language that is considered one of the official languages of New Zealand. Traditional Māori beliefs are based on a complex spiritual system that includes reverence for their ancestors and the natural world. They hold a concept called Mana, which represents spiritual power, authority, and respect. Māori culture is also well-known for its captivating performing arts, such as the world-famous haka, which is a combination of dance, chant, and posture, often performed at important events or ceremonies. In contemporary New Zealand, the Māori people have received recognition for their historical and ongoing contributions to the nation's growth. The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between the Māori chiefs and the British Crown, remains a defining moment in New Zealand's history. Though the treaty has been a source of conflict over the years, it serves as a foundation for ensuring the rights and interests of the Māori people within the country's legal and political framework. Overall, the answer to the question is an entity: the Māori people, who are the Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand. Their culture, language, and traditions have significantly influenced the development and identity of the nation."},{"question":"This article: Fanning first met Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug in a University of Queensland economics class in 1989. At the time of the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry. Fanning was called upon by film-maker Gregor Jordan in 2003 to perform the folk song \\"Moreton Bay\\" (named after the bay of the same name in the Brisbane area) and his own original composition \\"Shelter for My Soul\\" in Jordan's film Ned Kelly.

Being able to identify the different types of legal claims you might have can help you find the right attorney to offer you advice. Issue-spotting is a fairly complex procedure that law students tackle extensively over three years of law school – so don't expect to become a master. However, basic issues can be spotted more easily, and point you in the direction of the type of attorney you need to consult. For example, if the false accusations relate to something that harms your reputation, you may have a defamation claim against your accuser. An accuser might file a false report against you to manipulate you into doing something for them, such as giving them a raise or a promotion. That situation involves elements of blackmail or fraud. Your accuser also may have a discriminatory motive. For example, they may have made a false accusation against you because they don't want to work with (or be supervised by) someone of your race or gender. This is an employment law issue. Apart from asking trusted family or friends for recommendations, you also may be able to find attorneys to consult by searching online. Your state or local bar association typically will have a searchable directory on its website. Many bar associations have an attorney-referral service that will do much of that issue-spotting work for you. All you have to do is answer a few questions about your case, typically using an online form, to retrieve a list of attorneys who handle clients with problems similar to yours. Do a little research on the attorneys you find. Look at their professional websites to learn more about them and read client reviews. This can help you narrow down your list to a handful of attorneys who potentially could give you the best advice. Most attorneys offer a free initial consultation. You can use this to your advantage to get advice from a number of different lawyers without breaking the bank. This can be especially helpful if your case involves several legal issues and you're not sure which direction to take. If you are seriously contemplating pursuing legal action, and want to hire an attorney for that purpose, you should interview at least three. However, if you're just looking for some general advice on what to do and haven't made up your mind yet what to do, feel free to talk to as many or as few attorneys as you feel is necessary to make an informed decision. When you schedule the consultation, ask if there's any information about your case that the attorney needs before the consultation. Some attorneys have a basic information form they expect all potential new clients to complete. Do your best to get any information about your case to the attorneys as soon as possible – at least several days before the consultations are scheduled. This gives the attorneys plenty of time to familiarize themselves with your situation. Often, attorneys treat free initial consultations as little more than an opportunity to market and sell their services. However, if you come armed with plenty of specific questions, you can get the information you need. If you're planning on hiring an attorney, ask questions about their work and communication style. These consultations will be more focused on finding an attorney with whom you'll have a positive and productive working relationship. The consultation has a different focus if you're still trying to sort out what to do. Ask specific questions about your case as well as whether the attorney believes a lawsuit would be worth pursuing. Contrary to popular belief, most attorneys aren't sue-happy people who are itching to take any and every case that might come their way. If an attorney believes you don't have a case, they'll tell you. Likewise, if an attorney believes you have a case, but it's not a strong one or not one that would be worth the time and expense of a lawsuit, they'll tell you that too. After you've finished talking to several attorneys, you have a big decision to make regarding whether you want to file a lawsuit or take other legal action against your accuser. You may decide that you want to sue your accuser, or your employer, or both. Get in touch with the attorney you felt was the best fit for you as soon as possible so you can determine your next steps. On the other hand, if you've decided filing a lawsuit would be too much effort and you'd rather just move on with your life, call the attorneys you met and thank them for their time. Keep in mind that attorneys are experts. If one (or several) attorneys have told you that a lawsuit is not worth pursuing, you're probably better off dropping the issue. Focus on your work and repairing any damage that has been done to your reputation as a result of the false accusation. Summary:","response":"False accusations in the workplace can involve various legal issues, and identifying them can help find the right attorney for advice. To find an attorney, you can ask for recommendations from family or friends, search online, or use your local bar association's attorney-referral service. Research and consult with multiple attorneys, preferably through free initial consultations, to find the best fit for your individual case. During consultations, ask specific questions about your situation and the attorney's work style. After talking to several attorneys, decide whether to file a lawsuit or pursue other legal action, and choose the attorney who is the best fit for your needs. If a lawsuit is not advised, focus on your work and repair any damage to your reputation caused by the false accusation."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: flower, garden, pollinate","response":"In the carefully tended garden adorned with diverse, vibrantly hued flowers, industrious bees diligently buzz and flit from bloom to bloom, playing a vital role in the extraordinary process of pollination—keeping the spectacular circle of life flourishing for both the floral kingdom and the diverse species that rely on their bounty for sustenance and shelter."},{"question":"What would you need a light source to use?
