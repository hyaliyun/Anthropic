Gadi Schwartz reports for NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015) A flash flood warning was issued Wednesday for San Bernardino County during punishing monsoonal weather in Southern California. The warning was in effect for the Big Bear area, including the Lake Fire burn area, until 6:30 p.m. Tuesday due to lightning, hail and between 1 and 2 inches of rain per hour from monsoonal flow in Mexico. Send Us Your Weather Photos: Use #NBC4You The alert comes as temperatures and humidity levels rose to uncomfortable levels across Southern California at the start of a heat wave expected to last until early next week, and perilous conditions characterized by strong rip currents and high surf will prevail along the coast until tonight. Top News Photos of the Week Flash flooding submerged some major intersections and streets with water in Victorville and made it difficult for motorists to travel. One motorist who got out of his vehicle was swept away by the flood and ended up in a storm drain. Rescuers recovered the man but his condition was unknown. At Victor Valley College in Victorville, rain left some buildings with leaks and the storm knocked over several trees around the campus. \\"The combination of high pressure aloft and weak offshore flow will bring very hot weather to much of Southwestern California,\\" according to the National Weather Services. 2015 Southern California Images in the News Forecasters said \\"slight cooling\\" is expected Friday and Saturday, although temperatures will not be returning to normal until early next week. \\"The prolonged heat wave will bring a risk of heat-related illness through much of the week. Those at highest risk include children, the elderly, and pets without adequate shelter,\\" warned the statement, which noted that the heat would heighten electricity use throughout the region, \\"increasing the threat of power outages.\\" The NWS forecast highs today in the mid 90s in metropolitan Los Angeles and the low 100s in the San Gabriel, San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys as well as inland Orange County. \\"Maximum temperatures will reach dangerous levels across much of Southern California this week,\\" according to the NWS. \\"The peak of the heat wave will be Wednesday and Thursday, although today and Friday will only be a few degrees cooler. It will be cooler over the weekend, although maximum temperatures will remain well above normal. Temperatures are expected to return to near normal by early next week.\\" Temperatures Tuesday and during the rest of the heat wave will be running 10-15 degrees higher than normal, said NWS meteorologist Kathy Hoxsie. The high heat is being attributed to high pressure developing over the region, combined with the fact that only weak winds are blowing in from the ocean. Also afflicting the region is high humidity, which is forecast to be at the 50 percent level in the coastal plains -- the norm is 20-30 percent -- and around 40 percent in valley areas, compared to the teens, which would be normal, Hoxsie said. The humidity is attributed to lingering moisture from Hurricane Linda. The conditions prompted the NWS to issue an excessive heat warning for the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains in both Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with highs of 105 expected at low elevations, and the San Fernando, San Gabriel and Santa Clarita valleys. It will be in force from 11 a.m. today until 8 p.m. Thursday. Normally, excessive heat warnings are issued when humidity levels stand to make temperatures feel even hotter than they are, but in this instance the warning would have been issued in any event as a result of the high temperatures, Hoxsie said. Forecasters said those at greatest risk of suffering heat-related ailments were infants, the elderly, the homeless, outdoor workers and people taking part in outdoor activities in the heat. They urged residents to drink plenty of water; wear light-colored and lightweight clothing; stay out of the midday sun; check on neighbors and the elderly to make sure they are not being overwhelmed by the heat; and never, ever leave children, the elderly, or pets in a vehicle parked in hot weather. The NWS forecast sunny skies today and highs of 81 in San Clemente; 82 in Avalon; 85 in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach; 85 in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach; 86 at LAX; 92 on Mount Wilson; 97 in Irvine, Anaheim, Long Beach and downtown L.A.; 98 in Mission Viejo and San Gabriel; 99 in Fullerton; 100 in Yorba Linda, Palmdale and Burbank; 101 in Lancaster; 102 in Pasadena and Saugus; and 105 in Woodland Hills. Temperatures will be a couple of degrees higher in several communities on Wednesday and start a cooling trend on Friday. By Monday, many communities that will have withstood temperatures in the 90s and above will be back in the 80s. Along the coast, high surf is expected through tonight as a result of a long-period swell in the Pacific, said the NWS, adding that the highest surf -- 3 to 6 feet, with 7-foot sets -- will pound south- and southwest-facing beaches. \\"Strong, frequent rip currents will continue to be a significant hazard,\\" an NWS statement said. Anyone who plans to swim in the ocean today should do so near a lifeguard, the NWS urged, adding that beachgoers must avoid climbing on rocks or jetties because of the risk of being scooped up by \\"sneaker waves.\\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Answer:","response":"Shropshire Blue and Limburger are types of cheese, each originating from different countries and having unique characteristics in terms of flavor, texture, production methods, and aging process. They belong to the wide category of food known as dairy products, which are derived from animal milk. Let's delve deeper into the specific features of each cheese. 1. Shropshire Blue: Shropshire Blue is a semi-soft, blue-veined cheese originating in the United Kingdom. Contrary to what its name suggests, it is not actually produced in Shropshire but was initially developed in Scotland in the 1970s. The cheese was named after Shropshire to help boost its marketing and sales appeal. Today, it is mainly produced in the counties of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire in the English Midlands. The cheese is made using pasteurized cow's milk and employs the same blue mold spores (Penicillium roqueforti) and production methods used for making Stilton, another famous and well-loved British blue cheese. Shropshire Blue has a rich, creamy texture and a somewhat sharp and tangy flavor. The aging process typically lasts for about 12 weeks, resulting in the development of the cheese's distinctive blue-green veins that run through the characteristic deep-orange body. Shropshire Blue is an excellent choice for a cheese board and pairs well with various fruits, particularly pears, grapes, and figs. It is also commonly used in salads and sauces, and its unique flavor complements red wine or port. 2. Limburger: Limburger is a semi-soft, surface-ripened cheese that originates from the historical Duchy of Limburg, now comprising parts of modern-day Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Created in the 19th century by Belgian Trappist monks, Limburger quickly gained popularity across Europe, especially in Germany. The cheese crossed the Atlantic to the United States in the 19th century, where it continues to be produced today, primarily in Monroe, Wisconsin, known as the Limburger capital of the U.S. The cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk and is known for its pungent aroma, which results from the action of bacteria (Brevibacterium linens) used in the production process. The smell of Limburger is often compared to the odor of sweaty feet due to the same bacterium being naturally present on human skin. Despite its strong smell, Limburger has a mild, creamy taste with an underlying earthiness and slightly tangy aftertaste. Limburger is aged for about 4-16 weeks, during which its texture becomes softer and the flavor profile intensifies. Its edible rind turns from a pale yellow to a darker brownish-orange during the ripening process. Limburger is often consumed in a popular sandwich called a \\"Limburger sandwich,\\" which usually contains rye bread, a thick slice of Limburger cheese, and raw onions, served with strong black coffee or lager beer. In conclusion, Shropshire Blue and Limburger are two distinct types of cheese, each having their unique flavors, aromas, and textures. Both of these cheeses are enjoyed by cheese enthusiasts worldwide and can be found in various culinary applications, from cheese boards and sandwiches to salads and sauces."},{"question":"Text: While traveling through the Southern United States in around 1998, Martin McDonagh came across a couple of accusatory billboards about an unsolved crime, which he described as \`\`raging and painful and tragic (sic)''. The billboards highlighted the incompetence of police work and deeply affected McDonagh; he said that the image \`\`stayed in my mind (...) kept gnawing at me'' and presumed that they were put up by the victim's mother. This incident, combined with his desire to create strong female characters, inspired him to write the story for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh discussed the creative process, saying that it took him about ten years to \`\`(decide) that it was a mother who had taken these things out. It all became fiction (...) based on a couple of actual billboards''. Question: three billboards outside ebbing missouri is a real story? Pick your answer from: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","response":"[1]. No. Although \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\\" was inspired by real-life events and circumstances, it is not a strictly factual narrative or a direct retelling of an existing story. When Martin McDonagh traveled through the Southern United States in 1998, he came across billboards about an unsolved crime, which left a deep impression on him. This experienced stayed in McDonagh's mind and heavily influenced the creation of the storyline in \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\\" The billboards McDonagh saw might have been put up by the victim's mother, and this presumption eventually gave birth to the strong, complex character of Mildred, the protagonist in the film. McDonagh was also driven to create powerful female characters, and this further contributed to the development of the movie's narrative. The creative process took about a decade as McDonagh closely examined the real-life billboard incident and eventually shaped it into a work of fiction. This transformation resulted in the dark comedy-drama film \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\\" which weaves a tale of grief, anger, and search for justice in a small American town. In summary, while \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\\" was inspired by a real-life event that moved the writer-director, this movie is a fictional story that brings to life a range of human emotions and themes, enhancing the narrative and engaging the audience."},{"question":"The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972, with appointments made from headquarters (and later, also by branch committees).

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","response":"In the given scenario, the supposed perturbation in question is directly impacting a step of the process involving the use of a dishwasher to clean dishes. The dishwasher automates the process of washing dishes through a combination of water, detergent, and mechanical action. By addressing and improving individual steps, it is possible to enhance the dishwasher's effectiveness in cleaning. First, it is important to understand the dishwasher's steps to provide a clearer analysis: 1. Dirty dishes are rinsed: Rinsing off excess food particles and debris from the dishes can have a significant impact on the dishwasher's cleaning performance and minimize the chances of blockages and unpleasant odors over time. It is essential to remove larger food debris and loosen up any dried or caked-on residue before placing the dishes into the dishwasher. 2. Placing dishes into the dishwasher: Loading dishes properly by ensuring they are securely placed and not overcrowding the dishwasher helps in the efficient circulation of water and detergent throughout the machine. This also prevents dishes from chipping or breaking due to movement during the wash cycle. 3. Adding detergent to the dispenser: Using the correct amount and type of detergent specifically designed for dishwashers is crucial for optimal performance. The right detergent helps break down food particles, grease, and stains, resulting in cleaner dishes without any residues. 4. Closing the dishwasher: Closing the dishwasher securely ensures that the door latch is in place, preventing leaks and ensuring the dishwasher runs properly and safely. 5. Turning on the power: Selecting the appropriate setting or cycle based on the load, soil level, and energy efficiency is essential for achieving clean dishes without excessive energy or water consumption. 6. Washing and drying the dishes in 1.5-2 hours: The dishwasher's wash and dry cycles typically take 1.5 to 2 hours, using a combination of water pressure, detergent, and mechanical action to remove dirt and food residues effectively. The perturbation in question would directly impact one or more of these steps, either by improving the effectiveness of a specific step (e.g., better detergent) or enhancing the overall process by introducing new technologies or innovative techniques (e.g., improved water pressure system, advanced detergent dispensing mechanism, etc.). By directly impacting one or more steps in the dishwasher's process, it is possible to improve the overall washing and drying performance, resulting in cleaner dishes, shorter wash times, and even reduced energy and water consumption. Consequently, understanding and addressing these direct impacts can have a significant positive influence on the dishwasher's cleaning effectiveness."},{"question":"Study: Politicians can change hearts and minds simply by stating their views Let's get back to basics for a minute: How does democracy work? The classic understanding is that citizens form opinions on various issues, and then elect representatives who share those opinions. Moreover, when politicians deviate from the will of their constituents while in office, voters can simply vote them out of office in favor of a candidate more closely aligned with their views. Government by the people, for the people, and reflecting the will of the people. As you might imagine, political scientists' understanding of this relationship between public opinion and politician behavior has grown more complicated in recent decades. Some argue that politicians shape public opinion by showing that their positions are consistent with voters' underlying values. Other research suggests that voters often support policies simply because their favorite political leaders do. Now, a paper by political scientists at UC Berkeley and the Washington University in St. Louis reports on the results of a novel real-world experiment. The study finds that contrary to classic theories of democracy, voters did not view politicians more negatively when the politicians took positions voters opposed. Not only that, voters often adopted these positions themselves, even when politicians offered little or no justification for them. These results \\"leave open the possibility that politicians think the constraints public opinion places on them are stronger than they are,\\" the authors conclude, and they suggest that \\"politicians can enjoy broad latitude to shape public opinion.\\" Here's how the experiment worked: The researchers recruited 7 Democratic state lawmakers in an unnamed midwestern state. In the spring of 2014, the researchers surveyed registered voters in the lawmakers' districts to determine which issue positions had the least public support. The issues included everything from immigration to taxation to marijuana policy. The legislators then sent official letters to registered voters of both political parties in their respective districts. The letters were targeted toward voters who had expressed opinions that were at odds with the lawmakers' own stances. The voters were randomly assigned to receive one of three letters. From the report: (i) a “control” letter where the legislator introduced themselves, described the services their office could conduct for constituents, and described a few locally oriented achievements (e.g., designating a building downtown a historic place), (ii) a “direct” policy letter that added language in which the legislators took a position the recipient had not agreed with previously and made only the briefest justification for their position, and (iii) an “arguments” policy letter that added extensive arguments for this position designed to appeal to citizens’ values Finally, they performed a follow-up survey of the constituents to see how their opinions of both the issues and the politicians had changed, if at all. As it turns out, the positions staked out by the legislators had a significant effect on their constituents views: \\"The constituents who were sent letters with the legislators’ positions were about 5 percentage points less likely to disagree with the legislator and about 5 percentage points more likely to agree with the legislator.\\" More surprisingly, it didn't make a difference whether politicians provided good arguments for their positions or not: \\"We find little evidence that legislators’ arguments were responsible for their persuasive impact. Legislators appeared able to move constituents’ opinions by stating their own positions with minimal justification; adding additional arguments did not make them more persuasive.\\" Finally, lawmaker favorability was completely unaffected by knowledge of their policy stances. \\"We find no evidence that legislators suffered electoral costs by taking positions constituents disagreed with; citizens who received letters from their legislators taking positions they had disagreed with previously evaluated their legislators no less favorably.\\" \\"We were surprised by the fact that there wasn't any pushback from the constituents in terms of disapproval,\\" co-author Dan Butler said in an interview. Since voters tend to not know a lot about their state legislators, the expectation was that finding out about a disagreement would lead voters to perceive them more negatively. \\"It seems like a lot of people are predisposed to trust their legislators, even on policies we think of as inspiring a lot of controversy,\\" co-author David Broockman said. \\"Most legislators really do care about advancing the public interest. What's exciting here, and the reason why the lawmakers were interested in participating in the study, is that it gives them insight into whether they can help advance those causes further.\\" We tend to think of voters' political views as fixed and immobile, particularly in the current environment of polarization and partisanship. But these results suggest that politicians do have some latitude to sway voters' views. Moreover, it doesn't seem likely that voters changed their views due to raw political tribalism. The letters from the lawmakers didn't include information on party affiliation at all. \\"What this points toward is a world where politicians actually have special responsibility to inform the public because they are afforded special trust,\\" Broockman said. \\"The costs associated with doing the right thing according to their values are not as significant as they think.\\" That \\"special responsibility to inform\\" is a key point. The optimistic takeaway here is that legislators with sincerely-held beliefs have some power to bring constituents over to their side. But the flipside is that demagoguery may be more politically potent than previously assumed. For instance, Sarah Palin sold many voters on the false notion of Obamacare \\"death panels\\" as far back as 2009. Five years later, 34 percent of voters still believe in them.

Of course no where on the outside of the box does it tell you that you should be at least 5 months pregnant to hear the heartbeat (they do mention it in the instruction booklet once you've opened everything). So I had to wait about 4 weeks. I am now 8 months pregnant and have yet to hear the heartbeat no matter where I position the monitor or how still I lie. I can only pick up stomach noises and my own heartbeat. It's very disappointing. As for the music aspect- the baby doesn't require the microphone to hear so I'm returning this product and using my regular stereo to play music to him- [money] is too much for something I can do for free and the money can better be spent on something that works. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","response":"The review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses initial excitement for the product but encounters multiple disappointments throughout their experience, ultimately leading them to return the product and opt for more effective alternatives. The disappointment starts with the lack of information provided on the box regarding the recommended stage of pregnancy for using the product, which is later found in the instruction booklet. This discrepancy leads to a delay in the reviewer's ability to use the device and contributes to the overall negative impression of the product. Furthermore, the reviewer continues to experience ongoing difficulties while attempting to use the product, even when following the provided guidelines. Despite being 8 months pregnant and having tried various positioning methods to detect the baby's heartbeat, the reviewer is only able to pick up their own heartbeat and stomach noises. This inability to fulfill its primary function leaves the reviewer feeling dissatisfied and frustrated. In addition to these crucial issues, the product's music feature is also criticized as being unnecessary and overpriced. The reviewer points out that the baby does not require the microphone to hear music, and they have found a more cost-effective solution by using their regular stereo system. This further emphasizes the product's shortcomings and reinforces the reviewer's decision to return it. In conclusion, the review portrays the product in an unfavorable light due to a series of disappointments faced by the reviewer. These negative experiences encompass confusing product packaging, inadequacy in performing its main function, and the perceived redundancy of supplementary features. The overall verdict is that the product is not worth the investment, and the money could be better spent on alternative solutions that meet the user's needs more effectively."},{"question":"Information: - Max Amann (24 November 1891 30 March 1957) was a German Nazi official with the honorary rank of \\"SS-Obergruppenführer\\", politician and journalist. - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany.

Nelson used the new baseballs at the field to throw at Ryan because OPTIONS: (1). Nelson was the pitcher.. (2). Ryan was the pitcher..","response":"Nelson used the new baseballs at the field to throw at Ryan because Nelson was the pitcher. Nelson, a tall, lanky young man with a passion for baseball, had recently joined a local baseball team, the Thunderbolts. As a naturally gifted athlete, he quickly earned the position of the team's pitcher, showcasing exceptional skills and precision. He dedicated countless hours to honing his pitching technique and mastering various pitches to ensure that he could fulfill his role to the best of his ability. In particular, he focused on perfecting his fastball, curveball, and slider. As the summer sun shone down on the field, casting a warm glow over the neatly manicured green grass, Nelson enthusiastically took advantage of the new baseballs provided by the team's management. Each shiny, white leather ball seemed to hold the promise of potential, waiting to be hurled across the field in a display of Nelson's talent. Standing a few meters away from Nelson in the batter's box was Ryan. Ryan was a formidable opponent – the Thunderbolts' star batter and a highly skilled player in his own right. With his chiseled jaw, broad shoulders, and a steely determination in his eyes, he exuded confidence and prowess in every aspect of the game. His unwavering focus on improving his swing and hand-eye coordination made him a force to be reckoned with on the field. Nelson and Ryan formed an intriguing duo – the pitcher and the batter – locked in a fierce, yet symbiotic competition. As Nelson prepared to throw each new baseball across the field, their shared goal was not only to outperform each other but also to constantly challenge and encourage each other to reach new heights. With a mighty windup, Nelson unleashed a flurry of lightning-fast pitches, each calculated to test the limits of Ryan's batting skills. The balls whizzed through the air, leaving only a faint white trail in their wake as Ryan swung his bat with furious determination, trying to make contact. The steel of the bat cut through the air, sometimes with a satisfying crack as it connected solidly with a ball, and other times leaving a lingering, anticipatory silence. Nelson continuously adjusted the speed, angle, and spin of his pitches, allowing Ryan to adapt to each new challenge presented to him. This unique and evolving dynamic between the pitcher and the batter showcased the intricate dance that lies at the heart of the game of baseball. It wasn't just a game – It was a testament to the hard work, discipline, and determination of two athletes who were searching for greatness on the field. In this snapshot of time, Nelson and Ryan's respective roles as pitcher and batter presented a perfect tableau of the game they both loved and shared. Each new baseball thrown at the field was a testament to their dedication to the sport – a dedication that would lead them to push the boundaries of their abilities and continue the enduring legacy of baseball. And on this warm summer day, as the golden sun cast its soft, permeating light upon them, Nelson and Ryan were nothing short of unstoppable."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Explanation: Although neither option is ideal for flattening a slab of dough, using a tall alcohol bottle would be the better choice because it typically has a larger surface area which allows for more evenly distributed pressure while rolling. This results in a more evenly flattened dough. (B) is not the best choice because beer bottles usually have a smaller surface area.

A school at the centre of the Islamist ‘Trojan Horse’ takeover plot has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The report - made public yesterday but. leaked to the Daily Mail on Monday - revealed Golden Hillock, in Birmingham,. was doing 'too little to keep students safe from the risks associated. with extremist views'. It was placed in special measures after. Ofsted noted ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex. and relationships education was not taught properly. Denial: Golden Hillock school (pictured) has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The charges were rejected as politically motivated. The charges have been rejected by the school’s management as being. politically motivated. A statement from the school said it disputed the. validity of the inspection. Golden. Hillock secondary school in Sparkbrook is one of three managed by the. Park View Educational Trust - all of which are believed to have been. rated inadequate. A. Trust spokesman said Ofsted found no evidence that Golden Hillock. either promoted or tolerated extremism or radicalisation. It added it. did not accept Ofsted findings that the school was inadequate.’ It. said: 'The Trust does not accept the findings of the Ofsted report,. which mischaracterises the school, and is now challenging it through the. appropriate legal channels.' Golden. Hillock was one of 21 schools inspected after a letter - now widely. believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims. to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation. Trojan Horse. The. Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to. council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked. several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council,. West Midlands Police, the Department for Education and Ofsted. In. its statement, PVET, said it believed that the inspections had been. conducted 'in a climate of fear created by the 'Trojan Horse' letter'. Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons. Inspectors. who visited Golden Hillock concluded that the school was not doing. enough to raise students' awareness of 'risks of extremism', according. to PVET's statement. But. the Trust said it was crucial to note that Ofsted's report contained no. suggestion, or evidence, that the school either promotes or tolerates. extremism or radicalisation. It added. that it disputed the inspectorate's finding that there had been slow. progress in ensuring that staff had been trained in recognising the. signs of radicalisation and how to tailor their teaching to counter. this. And it claimed a finding that students are not being properly prepared for life in modern Britain was a 'misrepresentation'. It said: 'On behalf of the staff, students and parents who have worked so hard to improve their school, we are extremely disappointed to confirm that Ofsted has decided to place Golden Hillock in special measures.' Education: Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of Trojan Horse plots since 2010. 'While we support the role of Ofsted in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way, we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings. Golden Hillock is categorically not an inadequate school. It is also crucial to note that the school had been part of Park View Educational Trust for just five months at the time of the Ofsted inspection in March 2014. 'A number of the judgments are based on data and information that pre-date the Trust's involvement.' PVET runs three schools, including Park View Academy which has been at the centre of some of the most serious allegations. In the past, Trust chairman Tahir Alam has called the allegations 'a witch-hunt.' Earlier this week, it was revealed that three other schools inspected by Ofsted had been given a clean bill of health. The Birmingham-based schools published letters received from the watchdog which all found governance and leadership to be either good or outstanding - the highest rating available - and concluding that child-safeguarding standards were being met. Ninestiles School - an academy in Acocks Green - Small Heath School and Washwood Heath Academy were the first to publish the results of their inspections, after Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations. A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Gender discrimination, undue influence of extremist views, the school curriculum influenced by hard-line beliefs. This report confirms that Michael Gove can no longer seek to distance himself from this episode. He is responsible.' 'In 2010, Michael Gove was warned by a highly respected Birmingham headteacher that this was going on. Four years on, he has failed to act and has not explained why.' 'Rightly, his record is now being called into question. Rather than rowing with Theresa May, he needs to answer why he has refused to act.'

You can use a metal file to attach them 2). You can use a metal bracket to attach them","response":"2). You can use a metal bracket to attach them. To accomplish the goal of attaching a log to a board so you can more easily run it through a table saw, using a metal bracket is the correct choice. A metal bracket will provide stability and support as it securely fastens the log to the board, allowing the user to run it through a table saw more easily and safely. 1). You can use a metal file to attach them - This option is incorrect because a metal file is a tool used to shape and smooth metal, wood, or plastic, but not to join two objects together. In this case, using a metal file wouldn't help you attach the log to the board."},{"question":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"? The answer is:","response":"Question: According to Tony Davies in Humanism (1997), what is the role of humanism in contemporary society despite its shortcomings and the atrocities committed in the name of human reason? Answer: Despite its shortcomings and the horrors committed in the name of human reason, humanism still plays an important role in contemporary society as an alternative to bigotry and persecution. It provides the framework for advocating the freedom of speech, writing, organizing, campaigning, protesting, and disobedience in defense of individual or collective interests."},{"question":"Jan effects Quinn's escape by sabotaging it and calling the police. Given the context: What will happen to Quinn? Possible answers: go to jail, proud, smart A:","response":"Based on the context where Jan sabotages Quinn's escape and calls the police, the most probable outcome for Quinn would be that they will \\"go to jail.\\" Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Jan sabotages Quinn's escape - This step makes it difficult or impossible for Quinn to successfully carry out their escape plan. 2. Jan calls the police - Notifying the police implies that Quinn has done something illegal or is involved in a situation where law enforcement needs to intervene. 3. Police arrive - After being notified, the police will arrive to apprehend Quinn or investigate the situation. 4. Quinn gets caught - Due to the sabotaged escape and police presence, it is highly likely that Quinn will be caught. 5. Legal proceedings - After being apprehended, Quinn could face legal consequences, which could lead to jail time if found guilty of a crime. None of the other mentioned options, \\"proud\\" or \\"smart,\\" directly tie to the context provided.

The premise mentions a woman who is standing on a beach and specifies that she is wearing a bathing suit. A bathing suit, also known as swimwear, is a type of clothing designed specifically for swimming or taking part in water-based activities. It typically comes in various forms, such as one-piece suits or bikinis for women. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the woman is wearing a dress. A dress is a garment that is distinct from a bathing suit. It is typically a one-piece outfit made of various materials, designed to be worn from the shoulders to any length below the hips. Dresses are usually worn on social occasions or as part of everyday attire, depending on the style of the dress and the cultural context. Given the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not supported or proven to be true based on the information provided in the premise. The premise clearly states that the woman is wearing a bathing suit, which is distinctly different from a dress. Therefore, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true because it specifically contradicts the information in the hypothesis. Additionally, it is important to note that although the details provided in the premise do not directly support the hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is completely false. The woman could possibly change into a dress at a later time or have a dress nearby with intentions of wearing it. However, based on the information given in the premise alone, the hypothesis suggesting that the woman is currently wearing a dress does not correspond with the provided details, making it unsupported by the premise."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Biologists believe that love is fundamentally a biological rather than a cultural construct, because the capacity for love is found in all human cultures and similar behavior is found in some other animals. In humans the purpose of all the desire is to focus attention on the raising of offspring. Children demand an unusual amount of parenting, and two parents are better than one. Love is a signal that both partners are committed, and makes it more likely that this commitment will continue as long as necessary for children to reach independence. But what does science have to say about the notion of love at first sight? In recent years the ability to watch the brain in action has offered a wealth of insight into the mechanics of love. Researchers have shown that when a person falls in love, a dozen different part of brain work together to release chemicals that trigger feelings of euphoria, bonding and excitement. It has also been shown that the unconditional love between a mother and a child is associated with activity in different regions of the brain from those associated with pair-bonding love. Passionate love is rooted in the reward circuitry of the brain--the same area that is active when humans feel a rush from cocaine. In fact, the desire, motivations and withdrawals involved in love have a great deal in common with addiction. Its most intense forms tend to be associated with the early stages of a relationship, which then give way to a calmer attachment form of love one feels with a long term partner. What all this means is that one special person can become chemically rewarding to the brain of another. Love at first sight, then, is only possible if the mechanism for generating long-term attachment can be triggered quickly. There are signs that it can be. One line of evidence is that people are able to decide within a second how attractive they find another person. This decision appears to be related to facial attractiveness, although men may favor women with waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7, no matter what... Question: We can infer from the passage that _ . Answer: pick from the following. [+] pair-bonding love comes from a long stable friendship; [+] the mechanism for creating long-term attachment ensures love at first sight; [+] it is impossible for those ordinary-looking people to fall in love at first sight; [+] men may be attracted by a girl whose figure suggests her admirable reproductive capacity;","response":"[+] men may be attracted by a girl whose figure suggests her admirable reproductive capacity;"},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"b).\\" sentiment (pick from the following. a). negative b). positive).","response":"Step 1: Choose and focus on the positive sentiment for the movie review.

Ok pops, we'll be back at 4 on Monday. So Monday rolls around and we are starving by the time we get home from work at 4.

Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541.

As they primarily live in Kerala, the word Keralite is used as an alternative to Malayali. According to the Indian census of 2011, there are approximately 33 million Malayalis in Kerala, making up 96.7% of the total population of the state. According to the Indian census of 2001, there were 30,803,747 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 96.7% of the total population of the state.

They said the policy change was \\"disrespectful\\" and breached the Conservatives' 2015 election manifesto. But Cardiff North MP Craig Williams said there was no \\"big row\\" and AMs needed \\"some fiscal responsibility\\". Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said devolving income tax powers would mean \\"better government for Wales\\". Some of the MPs opposed to the move hope to raise the issue at a meeting with Mr Osborne on Wednesday. The five - Byron Davies, Chris Davies, David Davies, James Davies and David Jones - have written to him on the issue \\"This is a line in the sand for many of us,\\" one MP said. Another said it would be \\"very embarrassing\\" for the Conservative UK government if almost half of the party's 11 Welsh MPs were to vote against the measure. The letter said that during the general election campaign Tory candidates \\"were able to reassure people that the assembly would not get tax raising powers without the consent of the people of Wales\\". \\"To drop the commitment to a referendum would put us in breach of a clear manifesto commitment,\\" it continued. The Welsh Conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election made reference to an \\"expectation that the Welsh government will hold a referendum on income tax powers\\". The five MPs said people in Wales should not be \\"treated differently in this respect from the people of Scotland, who did have a separate vote on the issue of tax varying powers\\" in the 1997 referendum on devolution. \\"We frankly feel that to impose such powers without a referendum would be disrespectful to the Welsh people,\\" they added. Mr Williams responded: \\"You're going to have cases with business rates being devolved to areas like Manchester, where Manchester City Council might have more fiscal responsibility than the entire Welsh nation,\\" Mr Williams said. \\"It's about time they [the assembly] had some responsibility for income of money as well as spending it on their pet projects.\\" In December, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he thought public opinion was \\"fluid\\" on the matter, but there were \\"very, very strong reasons for why we need to press ahead\\" for Wales and the Welsh economy to get stronger. Splits within the Welsh Conservative group in Cardiff Bay on the devolution of income tax led to the party's leader Andrew RT Davies sacking four members of his front bench team in February 2014. They were re-instated in the summer. Mr Davies said he would use income tax powers to take 5p off the higher rate and 1p off the basic rate in Wales if he was first minister. A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said: \\"The position of the UK government and chancellor is very clear on this matter and we have long called for the Welsh government to be more accountable for the money it raises and spends.\\" A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: \\"This latest development shows the Tories' true colours when it comes to empowering Wales. \\"They support transferring substantial powers, including policing, to English cities without a referendum and yet are trying to block Wales having powers over small proportion of income tax which could be of benefit to the Welsh economy.\\" What was that article about?","response":"This article is about a disagreement between some Welsh Tory MPs and the UK government about giving the Welsh government the power to control income tax in Wales. Five Welsh Tory MPs think this decision is disrespectful and goes against their party's previous promise that there would be a public vote about it first.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential dancers in the history of film and television musicals. His stage and subsequent film and television careers spanned a total of 76 years, during which he starred in more than 10 Broadway and London musicals, made 31 musical films, 4 television specials, and issued numerous recordings. Context: Retirement didn't last long. Astaire returned to the big screen to replace the injured Kelly in Easter Parade (1948) opposite Judy Garland, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford and for a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals - one for M-G-M - Three Little Words with Vera-Ellen and Red Skelton and one on loan-out to Paramount - Let's Dance with Betty Hutton. While Three Little Words did quite well at the box office, Let's Dance was a financial disappointment. Royal Wedding (1951) with Jane Powell and Peter Lawford proved to be very successful, but The Belle of New York (1952) with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster. The Band Wagon (1953), which is considered to be one of the finest musicals ever made, received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds. But because of its excessive cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release. Soon after, Astaire, along with all the other remaining stars at M-G-M, was let go from his contract because of the advent of television and the downsizing of film production. In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, Daddy Long Legs (1955) with Leslie Caron at 20th Century Fox, when his wife Phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer. Astaire was so bereaved that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket. However, Johnny Mercer (the film's composer) and Fox studio executives convinced him that work would be the best thing for him at that time. When Daddy Long Legs was released in 1955, it did only moderately well at the box office. His next film for Paramount, Funny Face (1957), teamed him with Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson and despite the sumptuousness of the production and the strong reviews from critics, it failed to make back its cost. Similarly, Astaire's next project - his final musical at M-G-M, Silk Stockings (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse, also lost money at the box office. As a result, Astaire withdrew from motion pictures for two years. During 1952, Astaire recorded The Astaire Story, a four-volume album with a quintet led by Oscar Peterson. The album, produced by Norman Granz, provided a musical overview of Astaire's career. The Astaire Story later won the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, a special Grammy award to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and that have \\"qualitative or historical significance.\\" His legacy at this point was 30 musical films in 25 years. Afterwards, Astaire announced that he was retiring from dancing in film to concentrate on dramatic acting, scoring rave reviews for the nuclear war drama On the Beach (1959). Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","response":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects in the article for a five-year-old: 1. Fred Astaire was a very talented man who could dance, sing, act, and even helped create dance routines. He was famous for being in movies and shows where he got to dance and sing a lot. 2. He didn't just work in movies, but also appeared in Broadway and London shows, as well as making TV specials and recording music. That's like being on stage, in different countries, and on the small TV screens at home! 3. Sometimes, Fred Astaire would dance with a partner. One of his most famous partners was a lady named Ginger Rogers. They danced together in a movie called \\"The Barkleys of Broadway.\\" 4. Even though Fred Astaire wanted to retire, which means to stop working, he kept coming back to make more movies because people loved watching him dance. 5. When Fred's wife got sick and passed away, he was very sad, like we all would be. His friends told him that continuing to work and dance would help him feel better, and they were right. 6. Not all of Fred Astaire's movies made lots of money, but people still loved watching him dance, and he even won a special music award. 7. After a long time of dancing in movies, Fred decided to try acting in more serious roles without dancing. He received great praise for doing a good job in a movie called \\"On the Beach.\\""},{"question":"By Daily Mail Reporter A Mormon with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was killed at weekend while serving at a mission in Sweden.

Make this proper case","response":"When aiming for a holistic understanding of ecodesign, several factors and approaches must be considered to ensure sustainability, efficiency, and overall success. Ecodesign, also known as environmentally-conscious design, green design, or sustainable design, is a philosophy that focuses on minimizing the negative environmental impacts of a product or process while optimizing its function, performance, and value. 1. Lifecycle Assessment (LCA): Looking at a product or process from a cradle-to-grave perspective helps in identifying environmental impacts at every stage. This involves analyzing energy and material inputs, outputs, and waste throughout the entire lifecycle – from raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, use, and eventual disposal. LCA enables businesses to make informed decisions about design modifications, material choices, and recycling strategies for a reduced environmental footprint. 2. Materials Selection: Choosing eco-friendly materials can make a significant difference in the environmental impact of a product. Sustainable materials, such as biodegradable, recycled, or renewable resources, can be used to minimize waste and conserve natural resources. Additionally, considering material toxicity and potential chemical hazards is essential for a safe and responsible design. 3. Energy Efficiency: Reducing energy consumption throughout the product life, from production to use, should be a primary objective of the ecodesign process. This can be achieved by implementing energy-efficient manufacturing processes, utilizing renewable energy sources, or designing products that require less energy during operation. 4. Waste Minimization: Implementing waste reduction strategies, such as the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), supports the holistic understanding of ecodesign. By designing products for longevity and easy repair, promoting multi-functional designs, using fewer materials, designing for disassembly, and encouraging recycling, waste generation and disposal issues can be minimized. 5. Design for Stakeholder Inclusivity: Fostering a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach involves all stakeholders in the design process, from manufacturers and designers to policymakers, consumers, and local communities. By incorporating the knowledge, perspectives, and values of these stakeholders, a shared understanding of sustainability goals and innovative solutions can be achieved. 6. Social and Economic Considerations: Beyond environmental concerns, ecodesign should also consider the social and economic dimensions of sustainability. Fair labor practices, equitable resource distribution, cultural sensitivity, community resilience, and economic viability are some factors that contribute to the overall sustainability of a product or process. 7. Regulation & Policy Integration: Aligning ecodesign with existing policies, regulations, standards, and certification systems ensures compliance and promotes the adoption of sustainable practices in the wider industry. This also includes promoting transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain, ensuring the responsible sourcing of materials, and adhering to environmental regulations. 8. Continuous Improvement and Learning: Aiming for a holistic understanding of ecodesign involves the continuous evaluation and improvement of practices and designs in response to evolving knowledge and technology. Companies must be willing to learn from past experiences, adapt to changing industry trends, and research new and innovative solutions to remain at the forefront of sustainable design. In conclusion, a holistic understanding of ecodesign requires a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach that addresses the environmental, social, and economic aspects of a product or process's lifecycle. By incorporating these considerations, businesses can work towards a more sustainable and responsible future, ensuring the long-term health of the planet and its inhabitants."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

One is a school in which a white majority school lost black students. In the other example, a black majority school lost white students. But in both schools the use of vouchers resulted in less than one percent difference in the racial make-up of the schools. In addition, 90 percent of the students receiving the vouchers are black students from families with incomes less than 250 percent of the poverty line. The voucher plan is not a return to the days of white flight from public schools. And there is an even more important issue than school integration at stake: How can the Justice Department justify denying poor black students, the people with the lowest achievement record in U.S. schools, the rare chance to get out of failing schools and go to better schools? More than 80 percent of students in the voucher plan had attended poorly performing schools, rated ‘D’ or ‘F.’ This suit is the latest example of the Obama administration’s opposition to vouchers. The president has tried to eliminate funding for a Washington, D.C. voucher program more than once. Speaker of the House John Boehner had to make the D.C. plan a priority in budget negotiations to save it. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is on target when he calls the Justice Department suit a “political ploy.” Concern over giving poor black students a chance to get out of bad schools is certainly not the issue so it must be politics. As the governor recently said: “The Department of Justice is filing suit against the state of Louisiana – now listen to this – to force these children to go back to failing schools.” The politics of teacher union support for the administration seems to be the only explanation for why the administration would take a stand against better educational opportunities for black students. Politics can blind both the left and the right when it comes to school choice, including vouchers. But a clear-eyed look at research that shows no connection between school choice and racial segregation of schools. A study done at the widely respected Brookings Institution found no connection between the growth of charter school enrollment and student segregation. Based on nine years of federal data the study found that the rise of charter schools has not made a difference in the level of segregation in public school. Another study done at the University of Wisconsin analyzed test scores from 22,000 schools with 18,000 children and found that poverty, not skin color, is the hidden force driving most failing schools. Black students do get better grades and test scores when attending racially integrated schools with middle and upper income white students. But that is directly tied to getting those poor black students out of schools dominated by the culture of poverty, surrounded by other poor students and the problems children of any color bring to school because they are poor. The bottom line is that the research shows is that it makes no sense to judge schools as good or bad solely on the race of students. The Louisiana voucher plan being targeted by the Justice Department obviously has little impact on the racial composition of the schools cited in the suit since it has less than a 1 percent impact on their racial composition. But it has major impact on helping a few poor black students into schools where they have a better chance to succeed. And no proven connection exists in Louisiana to show that charter schools or schools accepting vouchers have more segregated student populations. With nearly 60 years in the books since the Supreme Court’s Brown decision to rule segregated schools an unconstitutional denial of equal rights, the nation remains aware of the persistent racial divide in public schools. And it true that black students in desegregated schools score better on tests. But that has more to do with escaping the stranglehold of poverty that with school choice. In the years since Brown v. the Board of Education Supreme Court decision, school districts have used a variety of strategies to try to increase student integration, from busing students to creating magnet schools and charter schools to draws students of different races together. But even with increased school choice the nation’s schools remain largely segregated by both race and more importantly by class. The average black, Hispanic and American Indian student attends a school that is more than two-thirds minority. And research shows if a student is poor enough to qualify for the federal free lunch program that student is in a school in which two-third of the other students are also poor and qualify for the free lunch. That is why the administration’s decision to tie school choice – specifically vouchers – to higher levels of school segregation is wrong on two counts. First, school choice does not lead to higher levels of racial segregation in schools. And second, no parent, black or white, should be forced to keep their child in a failing school when there is another option. Juan Williams is a Fox News political analyst.

The family of music star Jenni Rivera are said to be disgusted over the gruesome video leaked on the internet which shows parts of her bloodied dismembered body strewn amongst the wreckage. The Mexican singer's family want the people responsible to be brought to justice after the leaked footage - which shows a severed foot with painted toenails - spread like wildfire across the internet. Two Mexican police officers were arrested yesterday for looting from the wreckage site. One of these officers is thought to have sold the images to the media. Though the video was not confirmed as being authentic, the Rivera family said they believe it is due to the items in the video and images of the mangled body parts. Scroll down for video. Corrupt cops? Two police officers guarding the site where Jenni Rivera's plane crashed on Sunday have been accused of stealing personal items belonging to those aboard the doomed flight. Large personality: Rivera, 43, seen here in Los Angeles in March, was very popular among Latin music fans. Loved ones: Rivera's family gathered outside of her parents' home near Long Beach, California, on Wednesday night for a press conference. It also emerged the company that owns. the luxury jet she was traveling in is under investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the agency seized two of its planes. earlier this year as part of the ongoing probe. DEA spokeswoman Lisa Webb Johnson. confirmed on Thursday the planes owned by Las Vegas-based Starwood. Management were seized in Texas and Arizona. The agency also has subpoenaed all. the company's records, including any correspondence it has had with a. former Tijuana mayor who U.S. law enforcement officials have long. suspected has ties to organized crime. Sources close to the Riveras told TMZ. the family is appalled that anyone would even think about leaking. something like that, especially if it was a first responder. 'We're told the severed foot was the. most painful part to watch because Jenni was very particular about her. feet and toes,' the source said. The officers were caught after images of the crash site were found on one of the arrested officers' cell phones. The extremely graphic photos depicted. body parts and personal documents belonging to those aboard the doomed. flight, including Rivera, 43, a singer and reality star known as the. 'Queen of Banda.' The Spanish news agency EFE identified the arrested officers as Luis Antonio Ávila Moreno, 23 and Mario Alberto García Pacheco, 24. The items that the duo allegedly stole from the plane were not identified by investigators. As the issue of police corruption rears its ugly head, Mexican authorities hope to continue with the investigation of the tragic crash on Sunday. A person speaking on behalf of the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles told TMZ: 'We have over 2,000,000 police officers [in Mexico], and unfortunately some of these officers have been corrupt in the past, but we cannot generalize that the whole force is corrupt.' The rep added: 'Mexico has been working very hard to make their citizens and tourists safe, however it is not fair to judge the whole tree based upon a few bad apples.' Scatttered: One of the officers was additionally accused of taking graphic photos of the crash site, including body parts, and leaking them to the media. The body of the singer and reality star from California was found in the wreckage along with the bodies of six others, including her publicist, lawyer, make-up artist and two pilots. News of the arrests came as Rivera's family identified her remains. Nuevo Leon state security spokesman Jorge Domene said DNA tests are still pending. The singer's remains will be given to the family once the tests are completed in coming days. It was also revealed this week that Rivera was in the final states of buying the Learjet plane from business executive Christian E. Esquino Nunez, 50, who has a. long and checkered legal past. Corporate records list his sister-in-law. as the company's only officer, but insurance companies that cover some. of the firm's planes say in court documents that the woman is merely a. front and that Esquino is the one in charge. Esquino's legal woes date back decades. He pleaded guilty to a fraud. charge that stemmed from a major drug investigation in Florida in the. early 1990s and most recently was sentenced to two years in federal. prison in a California aviation fraud case. Esquino, a Mexican citizen,. was deported upon his release. Disastrous: Rivera's body was found in the wreckage along with the bodies of six others, including her publicist, lawyer, make-up artist and two pilots. Search continues: Rescue workers are still looking for remains of Rivera and the six reported passengers. ABC News exclusively reported that. Nunez could be wanted for questioning with Mexican authorities, as well. as investigators with the National Transportation and Safety Board. (NTSB) regarding the fatal crash. According to ABC News, Nunez and his. partner were convicted of creating false logbooks for. six aircrafts they bought from the Mexican government and sold in the. U.S. RadarOnline.com reports that Nunez. also has ties to a Tijuana drug cartel, and has also been accused of. trying to sneak the son of late Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi into. Mexico. Wanted? Christian E. Esquino Nunez, who runs the company that owned the crashed plane, could have links to a drug cartel and was convicted of falsifying records in 2006. Court records show that Nunez. obtained details from aircrafts and forged details so as to mark up. aircraft prices, thinking the models had fewer miles on them or had more. maintenance work than they actually had. Nunez’s current whereabouts are unknown. The plane carrying the superstar. plunged from more than 28,000 feet and hit the ground in a nose-dive at. more than 600 miles an hour, Mexico's top transportation official says. Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, Mexico's. secretary of communications and transportation, said: 'The plane practically nose-dived,' he said. 'The impact must have been terrible.' Ruiz Esparza did not offer any explanation of what may have caused the plane to plummet, saying only that 'The plane fell from an altitude of 28,000 feet ... It may have hit a speed higher than 1,000 kph (621 mph).' Widespread: Searchers used helicopters as they looked for pieces of the wreckage and attempted to recover bodies from the mountainous area where the plane went down. Discovery: It appears that one of the pilots was inexperienced, based on the temporary airman's certificate found at the crash site. Still grieving: Jenni Rivera fans marched in the streets of Monterrey, Mexico on Tuesday night, two nights after news broke that the singer likely died in a plane crash on Sunday. Holding a light: The hundreds of fans gathered in a pilgrimage to the Basilica of Guadalupe.

Uber, the car service that lets people summon rides via a smartphone app, was hit with its own storm this week when New Yorkers accused the startup of unfairly profiting by charging higher rates in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The San Francisco-based company, which said on Sunday it would enable “surge pricing,” backtracked today and announced it would return to standard fares for customers and eat the costs of paying drivers extra. “To get drivers out, we are now paying them the surge price,” Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg.com today. “There are huge losses for the business in doing this initiative.” He said that Uber will go with standard pricing as long as it can, “while we figure out more sustainable ways to keep supply up while the city is in need.” “Surge pricing” is a dynamic system that kicks in during peak demand periods such as New Year’s Eve. The Uber app displays a lightning bolt icon when fees are above normal to warn users before they book. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in August, Kalanick said dynamic pricing is used “if it will increase the number of rides that happen. When prices go up, more drivers come out.” Still, charging people more to get around New York in the wake of a natural disaster did not sit well with some people. When Sandy was barreling toward the East Coast on Sunday, the Uber New York Twitter account — run by the company’s community manager, according to its bio — wrote, “surge pricing will be enabled — we want to provide you w/ a reliable service. stay safe, & dry!” That was met with tweets like this one from Frank Denbow: @uber do you really need to do surge pricing at 2x in nyc now? And this one from Maurice Rahmey: New UBER deal: Storm Surge Pricing. The higher the winds are, the higher our pricing goes! What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"1.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.

Initially, the ratio of boarders to day students is 5 to 12. We are told there were 330 boarders. To find the number of day students, we can use the following proportion: (Boarders) / (Day Students) = 5 / 12 330 / (Day Students) = 5 / 12 Now, cross-multiplying and solving for the number of Day Students: 12 * 330 = 5 * (Day Students) 3960 = 5 * (Day Students) Day Students = 3960 / 5 Day Students = 792 So, initially, there were 330 boarders and 792 day students. Next, we are told that a number of new boarders, which we'll denote as \\"x\\", joined the school. This caused the ratio to change to 1 to 2. We can now write the new proportion: (Boarders + x) / (Day Students) = 1 / 2 (330 + x) / 792 = 1 / 2 Now, cross-multiplying and solving for x: 2 * (330 + x) = 1 * 792 660 + 2x = 792 Subtract 660 from both sides: 2x = 132 Now, divide by 2: x = 66 Thus, 66 new boarders joined the school.

Recently, I decided to visit the Shutter Falls Restaurant, having heard of its popularity and its 'unique' approach to dining. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share my concerns in this detailed negative review. 1. Ambience: To begin with, the ambience of Shutter Falls did not live up to the high standards I was expecting from such a well-known establishment. The interior appeared dimly lit and shabby; draped curtains and poorly spaced seating arrangements made the whole place seem cluttered. Furthermore, the music was obnoxiously loud, making it difficult to have any meaningful conversation with my dining partner. 2. Service: The service was nothing short of abysmal. After being seated, we had to wait for almost 15 minutes just to have our orders taken, despite the restaurant being only half full. The waitstaff seemed untrained and disinterested. They barely made any eye contact and were unresponsive to our requests for recommendations. Additionally, once we placed our orders, it took a good 40 minutes for our food to arrive, which was unacceptable. 3. Food Quality: When our dishes finally arrived, the presentation was lackluster, to say the least. One would expect a restaurant of Shutter Falls' stature to pay careful attention to the plating, which sadly was far from the case. To make matters worse, the taste of the dishes left much to be desired. The Chicken Alfredo we ordered was bland, lacking any flavor or seasoning, while the steak was overcooked, making it tough and chewy. The side dishes were equally disappointing, with undercooked potatoes and a lifeless salad. 4. Price: Honestly, given the quality of the food and service we experienced at Shutter Falls, the prices were outrageously high. We ended up spending close to 100 for a meal that was neither satisfying nor enjoyable. Had the food and service been exceptional, this price point may have been justified, but given the circumstances, it felt like a downright rip-off. 5. Hygiene: During our time at the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how unkempt the place was. The dining area had a musty smell, while the restroom was far from clean. I witnessed a staff member walk out of the restroom without washing her hands, which only deepened my concerns regarding the overall hygiene and safety practices followed at Shutter Falls. In conclusion, my experience at the Shutter Falls Restaurant was decidedly negative. With a disorganized ambience, subpar service, abysmal food quality, inflated prices, and questionable hygiene standards, I regret to say that I will not be recommending this establishment to anyone. Despite the hype and popularity it may have gathered, my time at Shutter Falls was marked by disappointment and discomfort. There are many other fine dining options in the city that offer much better value for money, and I will be turning to those establishments in the future."},{"question":"Information: - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at .

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude.

Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - Christian IV (12 April 1577 28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648. His 59-year reign is the longest of Danish monarchs, and of Scandinavian monarchies. - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals. - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938). - A personal union is the combination of two or more states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch. - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\". - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Akershus Fortress or Akershus Castle is a medieval castle that was built to protect Oslo, the capital of Norway. It has also been used as a prison. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Lysaker is an area in Bærum municipality, Akershus county, Norway.

From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015 25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066.

The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Norse Energy ( OSE : NEC ) is a petroleum and natural gas exploration and production as well as pipeline operator .

Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored. - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north. - The Scandinavian Peninsula (; \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia. - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars: - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland.

Much did she wish he could have such a friend as her brother would have been, and hope that nothing would prevent a friendship with her nephew. The present question about the horse was, she thought, unfortunate, since, though Guy had exercised great self-denial, it was no wonder Philip was annoyed. Mr. Edmonstone's vexation was soon over. As soon as she had persuaded him that there had been no offence, he strove to say with a good grace, that it was very proper, and told Guy he would be a thorough book-worm and tremendous scholar, which Guy took as an excellent joke. Philip had made up his mind to be forbearing, and to say no more about it. Laura thought this a pity, as they could thus never come to an understanding; but when she hinted it, he wore such a dignified air of not being offended, that she was much ashamed of having tried to direct one so much better able to judge. On his side Guy had no idea the trouble he had caused; so, after bestowing his thanks in a gay, off-hand way, which Philip thought the worst feature of the case, he did his best to bring Hecuba back into his mind, drive the hunters out of it, and appease the much-aggrieved William of Deloraine.

It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - The Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Commonwealth), also known as simply The Commonwealth, is an intergovernmental organisation of 52 member states that were mostly territories of the former British Empire.

The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a GREAT film. The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he's paid to protect. The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. So, I'm giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous. Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow. Well, he was right.

One promising direction is utilizing renewable resources, like wind and solar power. In urban areas, where space is limited, solar panels have been installed on rooftops to generate electricity for the buildings below. However, a new trend is emerging that incorporates solar technology in the very materials used to build structures, such as solar windows. Solar windows are made of transparent solar cells that can capture sunlight and convert it into usable electricity. These cells can be integrated into glazed glass windows in the form of thin-film solar technologies or embedded clusters of smaller solar cells. Despite the limited surface area for solar energy capture compared to traditional solar panels, their ability to generate electricity directly from building materials offers a new opportunity for harnessing renewable energy in dense urban areas. Hypothesis: If solar windows can be successfully integrated into urban buildings, they could significantly contribute to reducing the overall energy consumption of a city, decrease the reliance on nonrenewable energy sources, and help combat climate change, leading to a more sustainable urban environment. To test this hypothesis, several key aspects should be examined: 1. Efficiency: Investigate the efficiency of solar windows in terms of energy conversion and output, and compare it to the efficiency of traditional solar panels. Improvements in solar window technology and innovative ways to increase energy capture and conversion should be considered. 2. Cost-effectiveness: Assess the initial investment and long-term financial benefits of incorporating solar windows into urban buildings compared to traditional solar panel installations and the continued dependency on nonrenewable energy sources. 3. Feasibility: Analyze the technical and practical aspects of implementing solar windows in various urban settings, taking into account factors like building orientation, window size, and varying climates. This would entail studying their durability and effectiveness in different conditions. 4. Environmental impact: Evaluate the potential environmental benefits, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, and assess their long-term contribution to mitigating climate change. 5. Public perception and policy: Consider the awareness, attitude, and acceptance of solar windows among urban residents and policymakers. Investigate the potential for governmental incentives to encourage the adoption of this technology. To gather information and data for analysis, a combination of experimental implementations, simulations, and surveys can be employed. By examining these different components, the hypothesis can be tested and expanded upon to inform future innovations in sustainable urban design and renewable energy applications."},{"question":"Answer the following question: - teama is yorkshire - pointsb is 0 - coachteam is castleford - source is -lsb- http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/all.html rugbyleagueproject.org -rsb- -lsb- http://www.englandrl.co.uk englandrl.co.uk -rsb- - points is 614 - goalsb is 0 - birth date is 15 may 1955 - fieldgoals is 0 - coachyearstart is 27 aug 1993 - pointsa is 6 - fieldgoalsc is 0 - teamb is england - appearances is 585 +28 - triesa is 2 - yearbend is 81 - fieldgoalsb is 0 - yearcstart is 1978 - tries is 185 - death date is leeds - coachlosses is 53 - new is yes - retired is yes - triesb is 0 - coachyearend is 1 apr 97 - goalsc is 0 - appearancesc is 17 - position is ce so-fe lf-lk - teamc is great britain - appearancesa is 7 - appearancesb is 4 - updated is 24 april 2012 - yearcend is 84 - fullname is john d. joyner - goalsa is 0 - coachdraws is 4 - yearbstart is 1980 - pointsc is 7 - yearastart is 1977 - yearend is 92 - yearstart is 1972 - coachwins is 70 - triesc is 2 - nickname is jj - yearaend is 87 - fieldgoalsa is 0 - club is castleford - coachgames is 127 - goals is 0 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

His shoe got completely worn out during the race because the","response":"terrain was extremely challenging and unpredictable. The ground underfoot was littered with sharp stones, loose gravel, and muddy patches that only added to the difficulties of the race. The course twisted and turned through meandering trails, up and down steep inclines, and across narrow bridges suspended above roaring rivers, presenting a relentless barrage of obstacles for the competitors to overcome. As the starting gun fired, the racers lunged forward with the intention of not only finishing the race but also claiming victory. He kicked off with gusto, maintaining a steady pace as he navigated through the perilous terrain. The rough ground only intensified the wear and tear on his shoes, causing the sole to quickly erode. The harsh weather conditions also played a crucial role in the rapid deterioration of his shoes. The sweltering heat of the sun beating down on the parched earth caused the rubber on the sole to become soft and malleable. Over time, the combination of heat, moisture, and abrasive surfaces began to take its toll on the shoe, ultimately leading to its gradual disintegration. Despite his best efforts to maintain a solid footing on the slippery surfaces, he stumbled several times, scraping the sides of his shoes against sharp rocks and roots that protruded from the ground. The edges of the shoes frayed, becoming more and more vulnerable with each consecutive misstep. Sweat poured down from his brow, mixing with the dust kicked up from the trail, further weakening the shoe's integrity. As if the physical strain wasn't enough, the mental aspect was also taking a toll on him. The unpredictable footing and the constant barrage of obstacles chipped away at his focus and determination, making it difficult to keep pushing forward despite the mounting reservations in his mind. He doubted if his shoes would carry him to the finish line, but there was no option of turning back – he knew he must take it one agonizing step at a time. The final stretch of the race took the runners through a thick forest, where the ground was cluttered with damp leaves, mud, and slick roots. The moisture caused his already weakened shoes to feel heavy and sodden, adding to the exhaustion that had long set in. With each step, he could feel the sole of his shoe barely hanging on by a thread, threatening to give way at any moment. It was two miles to the finish line. His shoes barely resembled the sturdy pair that had carried him through countless races and training sessions before. The soles of the shoes now seemed to flake away with every footfall, the tattered edges just barely holding together. It was then that the unthinkable happened: his right shoe's sole finally gave in, completely separating from the upper and leaving his foot exposed to the cruel and unforgiving ground. He was faced with a decision: to admit defeat and withdraw, or to muster every ounce of inner strength and determination and continue on. With a grit of his teeth and a renewed sense of purpose, he pressed onward, feeling the impact of every step reverberate through his shoeless foot. The pain was excruciating, but he refused to be defeated. Clad in determination and a sheer force of will, he crossed the finish line limping, his shoe completely disintegrated but his spirit unbroken. Although he hadn't won the race, he had triumphed over adversity, a victory that carried more weight than any trophy could ever hope to offer. His worn-out shoes served as a testament to perseverance, an unspoken symbol of his unwavering resolve in the face of insurmountable challenges."},{"question":"Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis (born April 3, 1944), known professionally as Tony Orlando, is an American singer, songwriter, producer, music executive, and actor, best known as the lead singer of the group Tony Orlando and Dawn in the 1970s. Orlando formed the doowop group The Five Gents in 1959 at the age of 15, with whom he recorded demos, and got the attention of music publisher and producer Don Kirshner. Kirshner hired him to songwrite at 1650 Broadway, Manhattan as part New York's thriving Brill Building songwriting community, along with other songwriters Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Toni Wine, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil, Bobby Darin, Connie Francis, and Tom and Jerry, who didn't make it in the office until they later changed their name to Simon and Garfunkel. Orlando was also hired to sing on songwriter demos, and singles released with Orlando as a solo artist began to hit the charts in the US and the UK beginning in 1961 with \\"Halfway to Paradise\\" and \\"Bless You\\" when he was 16. Tony Orlando was born Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis on April 3, 1944, the son of a Greek father and a Puerto Rican mother. He spent his earliest years in Hell's Kitchen, New York. In his teenage years, the family moved to Union City, New Jersey and later Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Orlando's musical career started with The Five Gents, a doo-wop group he formed in 1959 at age 15, with whom he recorded demo tapes. He got the attention of music publisher and producer Don Kirshner, who hired him to songwrite in an office across from New York's Brill Building, along with Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Toni Wine, Barry Mann, Bobby Darin, Connie Francis, and Tom and Jerry, who didn't make it in the office until they changed their name to Simon and Garfunkel. Kirshner also hired Orlando to record songwriter demos as a solo artist, and his first success came at the age of 16 when he charted in the US and UK with the hits \\"Bless You\\" and \\"Halfway To Paradise.\\" He also appeared at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater with DJ Murray the K. Orlando also had four records that \\"Bubbled Under\\" the Hot 100: \\"Chills\\" in 1962, \\"Shirley\\" and \\"I'll Be There\\" in 1963, and \\"I Was A Boy (When You Needed A Man)\\" as by Billy Shields in April 1969. Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller wrote a doo-wop version of Stephen Foster's song \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" for Orlando. Released as a single in 1962, the song was picked up by the Beatles who included it in their set lists on the Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour; a recorded version was released on their 2013 album On Air - Live at the BBC Volume 2. New Colony Six recorded an Orlando composition, \\"I'm Just Waitin' (Anticipatin' For Her To Show Up)\\", which charted locally in Chicago and \\"Bubbled Under\\" the Hot 100 in July 1967. That year, Clive Davis hired Orlando as general manager of Columbia Records publishing subsidiary April-Blackwood Music.

Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively.

A. trunk B. funeral C. basement D. cemetery E. closet The best answer is Answer:","response":"The best answer is D. cemetery. A detailed explanation of each option: A. Trunk: While it's possible to find a dead body in the trunk of a car, this is not a common or likely place for most people to encounter one. This scenario is typically associated with criminal activities or a cover-up, and it is not an appropriate or respectful location for a deceased individual. B. Funeral: Funerals are ceremonies conducted to honor and remember a deceased person. Though it is likely that you would find a dead body at a funeral, once the funeral service is over, the body is usually transported to a cemetery for burial or taken to a crematorium for cremation. As the deceased are not left in the funeral location permanently, this is not the best answer. C. Basement: While basements can sometimes be the scene of horrifying events, finding a dead body in a basement is generally quite unlikely. Like finding a body in a car trunk, it would usually signify criminal activities, accidents or instances of concealment. As such, it is an inappropriate and uncommon location to encounter a dead body. D. Cemetery: This is the best answer because cemeteries are dedicated spaces for the burial of deceased individuals. They are designed as final resting places, where the deceased are buried in graves or interred in mausoleums with respect and dignity. Cemeteries are maintained and managed to ensure a peaceful environment for visitors to pay their respects to loved ones. As the primary purpose of a cemetery is to provide a location for the dead, it is the most likely place where one would find a dead body. E. Closet: The likelihood of finding a dead body in a closet is quite rare and is another example of a scenario that could indicate criminal activity or other untoward situations. A closet is neither a respectful nor appropriate location for the deceased, and it is not a common or likely place to encounter a dead body. In summary, among the given options, a cemetery is the best answer for where you would be likely to find a dead body, as it is the most common and respectful location for the deceased's final resting place."},{"question":"What is the most frightening (not most grotesque) horror movie of all time? And why? What are some of the most annoying things in horror movies? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available options: A). no. B). yes.","response":"The most frightening horror movie of all time is subjective, as it depends on individual tastes, preferences, and what truly frightens a person. One horror film that has been consistently called the scariest and stands as a classic is \\"The Exorcist\\" (1973), directed by William Friedkin. Adapted from the novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty, the movie tells the story of a young girl named Regan who becomes possessed by a demonic entity. \\"The Exorcist\\" stands out as the most frightening horror movie for several reasons: 1. Psychological fear: Unlike other horror films that rely on jump scares and gore, \\"The Exorcist\\" plays on the audience's psychological fears. The concept of possession is a terrifying idea, as it implies the loss of self-control and identity, with the individual becoming vulnerable to a malicious entity. It also touches on religious fears and the battle between good and evil. 2. Realism: The film is based on a purportedly true story of a boy's demonic possession and exorcism in the 1940s. The movie was well-researched and employed realistic details, making the events more believable and frightening for the audience. 3. Tension: \\"The Exorcist\\" is an expertly paced film, with slow, foreboding build-up. The tension rises gradually, making the possession and exorcism scenes even more horrifying when they occur. 4. Unsettling visuals and sound design: The film's makeup and visual effects, especially the change in the appearance of Regan, were groundbreaking and horrifying. The sound design—such as the demonic voice, unsettling noises, and chilling music—adds to the terror. As for some of the most annoying things in horror movies, they include: 1. Inconsistent rules: The frustration occurs when a movie establishes rules for its supernatural entity or killer, only to have them change randomly, creating inconsistencies in the plot. 2. Overused clichés: The use of tired tropes like the \\"final girl,\\" the untrustworthy ally, and jump scares can detract from the overall horror experience, as they become predictable and disorienting. 3. Dumb character decisions: Horror movies can be frustrating when characters make illogical choices that put them in harm's way, such as splitting up, not securing an exit, and ignoring signs of danger. 4. Reliance on gore: Some horror films focus too much on gory and grotesque imagery rather than building dread and fear. This can make the movie unpleasant to watch without invoking true horror. 5. Poorly explained plot twists: When a film introduces a plot twist without sufficient context or explanation, it can leave viewers feeling frustrated and confused. Moving on to the multiple-choice problem, the answer is: A). No. The first question aims to identify the scariest horror movie and why it is considered so. In contrast, the second question addresses annoying aspects commonly found in horror movies. These questions, while both related to the horror genre, are not the same."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: How much do you know about school life in Singapore? In Singapore, many middle school students spend a lot of time on their studies. People there always think that good schooling is the ticket to success .

Pilots over southern Arizona last month reported a mystery object flying above their aircraft in a flight-control recording released by the Federal Aviation Administration. \\"Was anybody above us that passed us like 30 seconds ago?\\" a Phoenix Air Group pilot flying a Learjet at 37,000 feet asked an air traffic controller at about 3:30 p.m. on February 24. (Click the video above for Twilight Zone-ish radio exchange.) \\"Negative,\\" said an official with the Federal Aviation Administration's Albuquerque Center. \\"OK,\\" the pilot responded a few seconds later. \\"Somethin' did.\\" A few minutes later, an American Airlines Airbus pilot reported seeing the same thing at roughly 40,000 feet over the Sonoran Desert between Picacho and Mammoth. No one knew what it was. Now, nobody's saying this is evidence of little green men, but the tape makes for a fun UFO story, clearly. And there's a possible serious side. Even in the likely event that the object has a mundane source, the incident may reveal a potential safety hazard because of its unexpected appearance in the sky. TheDrive.Com's War Zone page was apparently the first to publish the recording today. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the authenticity of the digital file on Friday and emailed a copy to Phoenix New Times. The FAA seemed to suggest that yes, this was sort of weird. \\"Other than the brief conversation between two aircraft, the controller was unable to verify that any other aircraft was in the area,\\" Lynn Lunsford, FAA mid-states public affairs manager, told New Times. \\"We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons.\\" In other words, the FAA should have heard about a weather balloon or military flight, but didn't.

In the recording, after the Learjet pilot's report, another voice from the sky piped up, \\"UFO!\\" A man laughed. \\"Yeah.\\" About three minutes later, officials revealed they were still thinking about the object. Out of the blue, Albuquerque Center alerts the crew of an American Airlines Airbus A321 flying from Dallas to San Diego to be on the lookout for ... something. \\"American 1095, let me know if you see anything pass over you here in the next 15 miles,\\" the control tower official said. The pilot's voice reveals his surprise at the question: \\"Over us?\\" The flight control official replied that a pilot in front of the jetliner reported seeing something \\"and we didn't have any targets,\\" meaning it didn't show up on radar. Forty-five seconds went by. \\"Yeah, something just passed over us,\\" the American Airlines pilot then reported. \\"Uh, like a — I don't know what it was, but it was at least two-three thousand feet above us. Yeah, it passed right over the top of us.\\" A moment later, Albuquerque Center asks the pilot to describe what he saw. \\"Can you tell us if it was in motion, or just hovering?\\" The pilot said he couldn't make it out, but the object had a \\"big reflection,\\" was flying \\"several thousand feet above us\\" and going \\"in the opposite direction.\\" A few seconds later, someone asked the pilot, \\"was it a Google balloon?\\" \\"Doubtful,\\" he replied. \\"UFO!\\" someone quipped.

Two airline pilots spotted a mysterious, reflective object hovering some 40,000 feet (12,000 meters) over southern Arizona last month, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is stumped. According to radio transmissions between the befuddled pilots and air traffic controllers (which you can listen to in full, thanks to an FAA recording recently released to the Phoenix New Times), the sighting occurred around 3:30 p.m. local time on Feb. 24, somewhere over the Sonoran Desert near Phoenix. \\"Was anybody above us that passed us like 30 seconds ago?\\" the first pilot asked while flying a Learjet west toward California. [7 Things Most Often Mistaken for UFOs] \\"Negative,\\" an air traffic controller at the FAA's Albuquerque Air Traffic Center in New Mexico answered. \\"OK,\\" the pilot responded. \\"Something did.\\" The object, whatever it was, was flying high — at least a few thousand feet above the jet, which was cruising at an altitude of around 37,000 feet (11,000 m), the New Times reported. A few minutes later, the FAA asked another nearby flight — an American Airlines Airbus traveling in the same direction — to keep an eye out for anything \\"passing over\\" it in the desert. The confused pilot agreed. And sure enough, within a few minutes, the Airbus crew saw the same mystery object fly over their plane. \\"Yeah, something just passed over us,\\" the Airbus pilot reported. \\"I couldn't make it out, whether it was a balloon or what … but it had a big reflection on it and it was several thousand feet above us, going the opposite direction.\\" Several weeks later, authorities are still stumped as to the object's origin. Beyond these two pilot reports, the FAA couldn't verify that any other aircraft were around. It likely wasn't a \\"Google balloon,\\" the FAA reported, nor a weather balloon or a military craft. \\"We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons,\\" an FAA representative told the New Times. In other words, whatever the UFO was, the FAA should have known about it. But it didn't. This report comes just a few months after a former Pentagon official revealed that the government has been quietly running an official UFO detection program since 2007. An investigation into the program by The New York Times turned up striking footage taken by two Navy fighter pilots, who appear to encounter a mysterious glowing object midair.

On Wednesday, he added a new term to the mix: spygate. As in, \\"SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\\" he tweeted, referring to the FBI's use of an informant who made contact with Trump campaign officials. The president also complained about a \\"Criminal Deep State\\" that set out to get him but is now mired \\"in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may have never seen before!\\" Related developments, including the views of some who think Trump is overstating the facts to deflect from the Robert Mueller investigation: Trump deflecting? The \\"spygate\\" tweet shows that Trump is \\"concocting crazy conspiracy theories\\" to try to discredit the Mueller investigation as it closes in on him, writes Greg Sargent in the Washington Post. Another critic, Jonathan Chait of New York magazine, runs through the particulars of the spy theory—\\"that the FBI, working on orders from the Obama administration, implanted a spy into the Trump campaign in order to help Hillary Clinton’s campaign\\"—and finds it to be \\"completely insane.\\" Nope, says Trump: In comments to reporters Wednesday, Trump denied that he was trying to undermine Mueller with his new allegations. “We’re not undercutting. We’re cleaning everything up,” Trump said, per Politico. Expand this summary.","response":"President Trump's recent tweets and comments about \\"spygate\\" have stirred up discussion around the investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia and the role of the FBI. He has accused the FBI of using an informant to make contact with his campaign officials and has also spoken up against a \\"Criminal Deep State\\" that is trying to bring him down. Some analysts, like Greg Sargent of Washington Post, believe that Trump's \\"spygate\\" narrative is an attempt to create a conspiracy theory to deflect attention from the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Jonathan Chait of New York magazine also discredits the spy theory, stating that the idea of the FBI, under orders from the Obama administration, planting a spy in Trump's campaign in order to help Hillary Clinton's campaign is \\"completely insane.\\" On the other hand, President Trump has denied these claims, stating that his allegations are not meant to undercut or undermine Mueller's investigation. Instead, he insists that these efforts are part of \\"cleaning everything up,\\" according to Politico. The controversy surrounding \\"spygate\\" contributes to the ongoing debate around the legitimacy and neutrality of the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Critics of the president argue that the \\"spygate\\" narrative is just another instance where Trump is overstating the facts to discredit Mueller's investigation, with the intention of escaping any potential consequences from it. Supporters of Trump, however, see the situation differently. They argue that the use of an informant to make contact with campaign officials is evidence of an unfair investigation that is politically motivated. This idea, when combined with Trump's recent tweets about a \\"Criminal Deep State,\\" results in the creation of a narrative that the investigation is a plot to bring him down. As the debate continues, it is important to consider the effects that such allegations have on the political climate in the United States. The president accusing the FBI and other institutions of engaging in a \\"major SPY scandal\\" only serves to deepen the political divide and further erode the public's trust in the government and its institutions. Moreover, it presents challenges to the ongoing investigation led by Mueller, as his team continues its efforts to uncover the truth amid increasing polarization. With \\"spygate\\" now added to an already long list of controversies related to the Trump campaign and Russia, it becomes increasingly difficult to cut through the noise to determine the validity and implications of these claims. However, it is crucial to maintain a focus on the facts and evidence, rather than fall prey to unfounded theories or allegations. Only by doing so can the United States hope to restore trust in its institutions and ensure that the investigation proceeds fairly and justly for all parties involved."},{"question":"Does \\"face\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? Dew dripped from the face of the leaf. Put a big sign on each face of the building that can be seen from the road.","response":"No, \\"face\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"Dew dripped from the face of the leaf.\\" the term \\"face\\" is being used to describe a surface area of a leaf. A leaf has two faces (front and back) and the use of the word 'face' here indicates one of these two surfaces from which dew is dripping. Therefore, in this sentence, 'face' denotes the flat or curved surface of any object (in this case, 'leaf') which is considered its front or outer part. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"Put a big sign on each face of the building that can be seen from the road.\\", 'face' is used to indicate a side of a physical structure that has an opening or can be seen. In this context, a building typically has four faces (front, back, and two sides). The sentence implies that there should be a big sign on each side (or face) of the building that can be seen from the road. Here, 'face' refers to an exterior surface or side of a larger structure (in this case, 'building'). Therefore, while in both sentences 'face' refers to the surface or side of an object, the objects (and thus the specific implications) are different. In the first, 'face' refers to the surface of a small, natural, and individual object (leaf) while in the second, 'face' refers to the side of a large, man-made, and systemic structure (building). Therein lies the difference in the use of the word 'face' in these two sentences."},{"question":"Aleksandr Chumakov, deathPlace, Moscow; Moscow, leader, Sergey Sobyanin; Aleksandr Chumakov, club, FC Torpedo Moscow; Aleksandr Chumakov, club, Soviet Union national football team; FC Torpedo Moscow, manager, Valery Petrakov What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","response":"Aleksandr Chumakov, a notable footballer who played for clubs such as FC Torpedo Moscow and the Soviet Union national football team, unfortunately passed away in Moscow, the city where Sergey Sobyanin is the current leader.

The other female pachyderms are charmed by the little baby, until he sneezes, revealing that he has a pair of oversized ears. Their words take on a different tune as they make fun of the little baby, giving him the ridiculing name of Dumbo. Dumbo's Mother just ignores their taunts and still cares for her child.At the circus' first venue, the elephants are put on exhibition for a number of people. However, one young boy makes fun of Dumbo, and also ends up pulling on his ears. This causes Mrs Jumbo to protect her son, but her actions cause the Ringmaster and the other circus people to claim her to be a mad elephant, and she is locked away.After this incident, none of the other elephants show any compassion or want to help Dumbo after his Mother is taken away. The only one who comes to his aid in friendship is a little mouse named Timothy. Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well. Timothy feels that Dumbo just needs to prove himself, and while the Ringmaster is asleep, whispers the idea for an elaborate performance by the elephants.The elephants climb on top of each other, and the plan is for Dumbo to be launched to the top, holding a little flag.

In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty's 1936 set. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto? Answer:","response":"The person who made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto is the composer himself, Sir William Walton. Although he was a reluctant conductor, Walton conducted many of the EMI recordings, which included these works, as well as some for other labels.

The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me. In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed. At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews....

He was the founder of Iran as an Islamic republic and the leader of its 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of 2500 years of Persian monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. Khomeini was not allowed to return to Iran during the Shah's reign (as he had been in exile). On 17 January 1979, the Shah left the country (ostensibly \\"on vacation\\"), never to return. Two weeks later, on Thursday, 1 February 1979, Khomeini returned in triumph to Iran, welcomed by a joyous crowd estimated (by BBC) to be of up to five million people. On his chartered Air France flight back to Tehran 120 journalists accompanied him, including three women. One of the journalists, Peter Jennings, asked: \\"Ayatollah, would you be so kind as to tell us how you feel about being back in Iran?\\" Khomeini answered via his aide Sadegh Ghotbzadeh: \\"Hichi\\" (Nothing). This statement--much discussed at the time and since--was considered by some reflective of his mystical beliefs and non-attachment to ego. Others considered it a warning to Iranians who hoped he would be a \\"mainstream nationalist leader\\" that they were in for disappointment. To others, it was a reflection of an unfeeling leader incapable or unconcerned with understanding the thoughts, beliefs, or the needs of the Iranian populace. Khomeini adamantly opposed the provisional government of Shapour Bakhtiar, promising \\"I shall kick their teeth in. I appoint the government.\\" On 11 February (Bahman 22), Khomeini appointed his own competing interim prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, demanding, \\"since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed.\\" It was \\"God's government,\\" he warned, disobedience against him or Bazargan was considered a \\"revolt against God.\\" As Khomeini's movement gained momentum, soldiers began to defect to his side and Khomeini declared ill fortune on troops who did not surrender. On 11 February, as revolt spread and armories were taken over, the military declared neutrality and the Bakhtiar regime collapsed. On 30 and 31 March 1979, a referendum to replace the monarchy with an Islamic Republic passed with 98% voting in favour of the replacement, with the question: \\"should the monarchy be abolished in favour of an Islamic Government?\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why did they allow him back in?","response":"The passage does not explicitly mention the reason they allowed Khomeini back into Iran. However, it can be inferred that they allowed him back in because the Shah had left the country, and the growing momentum of Khomeini's movement and support from the Iranian people likely influenced the decision."},{"question":"What's an example of a movie review?","response":"To create an example of a movie review, I will follow these steps: 1.

Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Dog Boy ( born Robert Rogers ) is a singer and songwriter , currently signed with Suburban Noize Records as a solo artist . Along with his solo project he also supplied vocals for the reggae / punk rock band , Too Rude , who are also signed with Subnoize . - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - An anti-establishment view or belief is one which stands in opposition to the conventional social, political, and economic principles of a society. The term was first used in the modern sense in 1958, by the British magazine \\"New Statesman\\" to refer to its political and social agenda. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Garage rock (shortened as \\"garage\\"; sometimes '60s punk\\" or \\"garage punk\\") is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada. The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional. The phrase \\"garage band\\" is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Suburban Noize Records, also known as \\"Subnoize\\", is an independent record label based in Burbank, California that specializes in punk rock and underground hip hop. The label was founded in 1997 by Kottonmouth Kings vocalist Brad Xavier and Kevin Zinger. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a \\"libretto\\" and their writer, as a \\"librettist\\". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song. - Kottonmouth Kings is an American hip hop group from Placentia, Orange County, California. The band officially formed in 1996, describing their eclectic sound as \\"psychedelic hip-hop punk rock\\". Kottonmouth Kings are composed of Daddy X (singer of Humble Gods, X Pistols, former singer of Doggy Style), Lou Dog (drummer of Humble Gods and former drummer of Doggy Style), D-Loc, DJ Bobby B, and newest member/ vocalist, The Dirtball.

Should I validate this answer? A:","response":"Yes, you can validate this answer with some additional information and context. A dwarf planet is a celestial body that orbits the sun and has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome the rigid body forces giving it a nearly round shape. However, it has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other debris, which is the primary distinction between a dwarf planet and a regular planet. As for the statement \\"It is suspected that another hundred or so known objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets,\\" this is plausible. In our solar system, there are currently five officially recognized dwarf planets: Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres. However, astronomers believe there may be more than a hundred additional bodies that could potentially be classified as dwarf planets, as they meet the necessary criteria. These potential dwarf planets are mainly found in the Kuiper Belt and the Asteroid Belt.

Thus, the primary reason for the narrator's bruises and cuts is option C), being attacked by the children they work with, which they described as \\"being mauled by kids.\\" A crucial aspect of their job appears to be their ability to tolerate and navigate difficult situations, as they continue to come back for more, indicating their passion, dedication, and love for their profession and the kids they work with."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question Following a shocking loss to the 3-7 Kansas City Chiefs the previous week, the Steelers traveled to M&T Bank Stadium for another divisional game. Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game. With their second consecutive overtime loss, the Steelers fell to 6-5. How many catches did Clayton have?","response":"The article does not provide the exact number of catches made by Clayton.

The city surrendered on 7 August; Alfonso XII was proclaimed king on 29 December 1874, and arrived in Valencia on 11 January 1875 on his way to Madrid, marking the end of the first republic.

The rapper has been ranting wildly on Twitter -- including several pro-Trump tweets -- following reports that he abruptly fired his manager Scooter Braun. Beginning Tuesday and extending into Wednesday afternoon, the rapper tweeted nearly constantly about everything from his Yeezy fashion line to Coachella and his daughter, North. In the afternoon, he took the time to send some love to his \\"brother\\" Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The love seems mutual as Trump tweeted back at the rapper, \\"Thank you Kanye, very cool!\\" Later in the day, the star even had some things to say about former president Barack Obama. But it didn't take long for West's wife, Kim Kardashian, to chime in and require her husband to clairfy a few things about his political tweets. She also went on a rant of her own defending her husband's tweets. Many of West's tweets seemed disconnected or nonsensical and some focused on slamming recent media coverage that claims those close to West are concerned for his health. The news of Braun's firing comes a few days after Ebro Darden, of Hot 97’s “Ebro in the Morning,” claimed West told him during a wide-ranging interview, “Nobody really showed love for me when I was addicted to opioids and in the hospital.” He wrote Wednesday: \\"there's been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts. Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap.\\" He also tweeted about his rumored presidential ambitions. \\"Harvey Levin of TMZ your hearing from your future president. Let's be friends. Please never use the word erratic to describe a person who is economically and psychologically empowered.\\" He also acknowleged that he fired Braun writing, \\"I can't be managed.\\" He added: \\"yes I got rid of my last lawyer why? Because he wouldn't come to work full time. I also asked my last manager to come work full time for Yeezy of course the last lawyer and manager said no. So now I hired a CEO and a CFO and i have two full time lawyers as of now.\\" West abruptly fired A-list manager Braun, who also reps Ariana Grande and Justin Beiber. According to Page Six, West has recently also fired other members of his \\"inner circle\\" following his big announcement of five new albums, a philosophy book and hinting a possible presidential run with a tweet that simply read, \\"2024.\\" Sources in the industry told Page Six they are “very worried for Yeezy’s mental health” and worry that he could be on the verge of “another episode.” In the midst of West's bizarre Twitter rant, it was also reported that the \\"Famous\\" rapper has had \\"explosive fights\\" with his mother-in-law, Kim Kardashian's mom Kris Jenner. But the momager quickly shot down the rumors and did some tweeting of her own. On Tuesday, Jenner retweeted a People magazine article that claimed she and Kanye were in the middle of spat and said, \\"Lies, Lies, Lies.\\" She further defended her son-in-law and retweeted another article, which alleged the Kanye has been \\"on edge\\" and \\"difficult to deal with\\" and said, \\"Nope...not true!\\" The rapper also tweeted at People and warned them about tweeting his name and said, \\"People magazine. Watch how you speak my name. You would love a pair of Yeezys. Don't play yourself.\\" West's current actions on Twitter are reminiscent of his behavior back in November 2016 when the performer was forced to cancel 21 tour dates after suffering a “nervous breakdown.\\" During the time of his break down, the singer was said to be hospitalized for exhaustion which was triggered by the anniversary of his mother's death on top of stress from trying to balance a tour, an album and his fashion line. The claim from Darden that the hospitalization stemmed from a drug addiction is new. But one source told People that Kanye's current mood wasn't anything to worry about and blamed his \\"genius\\" personality for his controversial behavior. “I think a lot of that stuff is Kanye,” the source said. “He’s always been like that.

Each tire can hold 500 cubic inches of air. Two of the tires are completely flat and empty. One tire is 40% full and the last tire is 70% full. If Carson injects 50 cubic inches of air with each pump, how many pumps will it take him to fill all the tires? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the required air volume for each tire. - Tire 1 (empty): 500 cubic inches - Tire 2 (empty): 500 cubic inches - Tire 3 (40% full): 500 cubic inches x (1 - 0.4) = 500 x 0.6 = 300 cubic inches - Tire 4 (70% full): 500 cubic inches x (1 - 0.7) = 500 x 0.3 = 150 cubic inches Step 2: Calculate the total required air volume. Total air volume = 500 + 500 + 300 + 150 = 1,450 cubic inches Step 3: Determine the number of pumps required. Since each pump injects 50 cubic inches of air, Number of pumps = Total air volume / Air per pump = 1,450 cubic inches / 50 cubic inches/pump ≈ 29 pumps It would take Carson approximately 29 pumps to fill all the tires."},{"question":"Question: What does URL mean?

Startlingly beautiful, with skin roasted a deep chestnut from the desert sun, the petite 26-year-old in flimsy leather sandals appears the unlikeliest adventurer for a nine-month expedition across the Australian outback. Appearances can be deceiving. In 1977, Robyn Davidson trekked 2,700 kilometers from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean, armed with little more than a map and a rifle, in a landscape which had destroyed many a hardened explorer before her. Adventurers are often asked why they push themselves to the human body's limits. \\"It's only in hindsight that there's any psychologizing of it,\\" Davidson tells me in between bites of her croissant, at a trendy inner-city London cafÃ© on a humid spring morning. \\"At the time it just seemed like a perfectly sensible, good thing to do. Above all else, it was pleasurable.\\" And in an age of instant communication, where you are never far from a text message, tweet or Facebook post, perhaps Davidson has a lesson for us all. \\"I disappeared but I've never felt so alive,\\" she says in her soft Australian accent. Making Tracks. It's no coincidence these punishing red plains are nicknamed the country's \\"dead heart.\\" A place where temperatures can exceed a scorching 120F and the nearest town is often hundreds of kilometers away. The Aboriginals called Davidson the \\"desert woman,\\" and her epic journey caught the attention of National Geographic photographer Rick Smolan -- who became both her documenter and lover. His intimate images of the intrepid young woman -- tenderly feeding her camels, or swimming in a rare watering hole -- helped make it one of the most popular photo essays in the magazine's history. It plunged the girl who grew up on a cattle station in remote Queensland into the international spotlight -- her outback odyssey became the toast of New York. Davidson's book detailing the marathon mission, called \\"Tracks,\\" has since sold over one million copies, bringing to life the beauty and brutality of a landscape mysterious to many outside Australia -- and indeed to the majority of people living in the country's coastal cities. The book has now been turned into a feature film, with actor Mia Wasikowska possessing an unnerving resemblance to the real-life desert woman. A literary life. Wearing a crisp white shirt, Davidson's broad face remains unmarked by a lifetime in the sun. At 63-years-old, she is still as quietly striking as those images of a fair-haired girl on camel-back staring fiercely into the camera three decades ago. How do you follow an expedition of such epic proportions? In her late 20s, Davidson moved to a shoe factory in London's East End, of all places. She fell in with a literary circle that included housemate and celebrated author Doris Lessing, and boyfriend-of-three-years Salman Rushdie. A nomad at heart, Davidson lived across the world, shifting like the sands of her impressive landscapes. Now she's back in the UK capital to write her memoirs -- about as far away as you can get from her extreme pilgrimages, including two years traveling with nomads in north-west India in the 1990s. Pleasure and pain. \\"Why not?\\" has become Davidson's enduring response to why she ventured into Australia's great unknown in the 1970s an era before. Where other people might see a vast expanse of arid nothingness, Davidson saw the desert as a \\"limitless garden,\\" a place \\"teeming with life.\\" It was a desert she traversed without GPS trackers and high-tech camping kit. Learning bush skills from the aboriginal communities she met along the way, Davidson ate witchetty grubs -- which to the easily-queasy might resemble enormous maggots. She quickly learned not to trust her maps in this unchartered landscape, and instead followed animal tracks towards water. Not bad for the girl who police initially wouldn't register a rifle to, because they thought they'd have to go chasing after her when she got lost. Real-life romance. Even Smolan -- the 27-year-old photographer who spent three months with Davidson at intermittent points throughout the journey -- was convinced that each time he looked back at her in his rear view mirror, it would be the last. \\"There were herds of wilds animals, crazy people out there,\\" he says over the phone, the sound of traffic blaring in the background of his native New York. \\"Her camels could have thrown her, she could have broken a leg, she could have gotten lost. It's the kind of place where if you take the wrong road, after three weeks you come to a fence and find you're out of water.\\" Much is made in the film of the pair's romantic coupling, but in the searing heat it was a relationship tempered by more complex emotions -- some still raw for Smolan. \\"I was resistant to Rick because I felt I'd sold out to National Geographic,\\" says Davidson, who never intended to write about her personal pilgrimage at all. \\"He's a sweetie, but hopeless in the desert. But when you are forced to deal with somebody, you either kill them or you learn tolerance. And we're still very good friends so... I think it forged a very deep friendship actually.\\" Smolan has a different take: \\"It was much more of a romance -- at least on my side -- then it was in the movie.\\" \\"I was pretty smitten and you can see that in the photographs,\\" he says of the \\"intense and fascinating woman who didn't want me there.\\" \\"She had no idea how beautiful she was. Several times I developed my pictures and brought them out to show her, thinking I could win her over -- because most women like it when you show them how beautiful they are. And I remember being really stunned that the more beautiful my pictures where of her, the more she hated them. \\"She just said: 'I'm not some god dammed model out here.\\" Four-legged family. Was Davidson's real adoration for her faithful dog Diggity and four camels, a type of ramshackle circus family inching across the desert together? \\"The love story of the movie is much more between her and the dog, than her and me,\\" says Smolan, chuckling good-naturedly. \\"This little dog was like her protector. If there were snakes, if there were intruders... Diggity had her back.\\" But why camels? \\"They're the perfect form of transport,\\" explains Davidson matter-of-factly in her book. \\"One sees little by car, and horses would never survive the hardships of desert crossings.\\" This was not about conquering nature, she says, bristling at the suggestion. Instead, Davidson wanted to meld into the environment, her skin slowly turning the same reddish brown as the ancient lands she walked. \\"Maybe for men it's a longing to conquer something. They conquer the mountain, they conquer something in themselves. I never felt that way. For me it was more of a merging into, entering into, becoming part of.\\" Tough love. She'd see other travelers \\"hurtling through the desert in a four-wheel drive, with two-wave radios, and iceboxes, and think -- why bother?\\" \\"My procedure across that desert was about getting rid of stuff -- both physically and metaphorically.\\" Did that include the memory of her mother's suicide when she was 11-years-old, as suggested in the film? Davidson sighs, and you get the feeling it's a diagnosis she's heard many times before. \\"It kind of seems to say that for a woman to have done anything extraordinary, she has to be a bit strange, or have something to work out, or there has to be some sort of dark thing in her past. \\"I don't think my mother's death had much to do with it at all, frankly.\\" Myth and memory. These days, where even NASA astronauts can tweet every step of their missions to millions across the world, Davidson's slow and deeply personal journey feels all the more rare -- and mysterious. \\"It's a tale with mythical elements,\\" she says, her gray eyes revealing the only hint of sun damage on her serene face. \\"If you think of all the enduring stories in the world, they're of journeys. Whether it's Don Quixote or Ulysses, there's always this sense of a quest -- of a person going away to be tested, and coming back.\\" How lucky we are she did.

Steps to perform the task: 1. Gather information on the physical objects: - Understand that books are physical objects. - Identify the size, shape, and weight of the books. - Determine the bookshelf's dimensions, its available space, and the number of shelves. 2. Identify the organization criteria: - Decide the sorting method (alphabetically by author, by size, by genre, by publication date, etc.). 3. Begin organizing the books: - Remove the current books from the shelf if they are already placed haphazardly. 4. Sort the books: - Based on the decided organization criteria, group books in similar categories together. 5. Place the books on the shelves: - Estimate the number of books that can fit on each shelf based on the bookshelf dimensions and the size of the books. - Consider the weight distribution; avoid weighing down one shelf with heavy books. - Ensure the books fit the shelf space without overstuffing. - Optionally, place bookends to keep books in place and tidy. 6. Make adjustments: - If a book doesn't fit comfortably on a shelf, reconsider the sorting or placement strategy. 7. Review the organization: - Assess the overall appearance and functionality of the organized bookshelf. - Ensure that the books are easily accessible and visible. By following these steps, we can successfully organize a bookshelf while considering the physical properties of the books and the bookshelf itself."},{"question":"@librarybug interesting question on assignmets I'll say u r incharge how far u can push limits sky is the limit-this is whatv they say What is the sentiment of this tweet?","response":"To analyze the sentiment of this tweet, I'll break it down step-by-step: 1.

Goliath is known as an imposing and fearsome giant who challenged the Israelites to a one-on-one combat to settle the conflict between the Philistines and the Israelites. Goliath's story is most famously recounted in the biblical text of 1 Samuel 17. According to the narrative, Goliath's height was six cubits and a span, which is estimated to be between 9 to 13 feet tall, depending on the exact length of a cubit. Goliath was a skilled warrior who was both well-armed and heavily armored. He had a bronze helmet, a coat of mail weighing 5,000 shekels of bronze (around 125 pounds), and bronze leg armor. He carried a large and heavy spear with an iron point weighing 600 shekels (approximately 15 pounds). The battle between David and Goliath took place in the Valley of Elah, where the Philistines had gathered their forces against the Israelites. Goliath would come out to the battle lines each day and challenge the Israelite army, taunting and defying them to send forth a warrior to face him in single combat. The Israelites, including their then-King Saul, were terrified and unable to muster the courage to face Goliath. David, a young shepherd boy and the youngest son of Jesse from the town of Bethlehem, was not a part of the Israelite army but had come to visit his brothers on the battlefield. David was deeply troubled by Goliath's defiance and mockery of the Israelite army and their God. He volunteered to face Goliath in battle, and, despite his lack of military experience and young age, King Saul allowed him to fight on behalf of the Israelites. David, determined to face Goliath using his faith in God and his abilities as a young shepherd, confidently approached Goliath armed with a simple slingshot and five smooth stones that he picked up from a brook. As they engaged in their epic battle, David slung a stone at Goliath, striking him in the forehead. The stone sunk deep into Goliath's skull, and he fell to the ground. David then took Goliath's own sword and beheaded him, marking a decisive victory for the Israelites. The defeat of Goliath by the young David became a symbol of faith, humility, and the power of God working through an individual, despite apparent disadvantages. This astounding victory helped solidify David's reputation as a brave and favored servant of God, eventually leading to his ascension as the second king of Israel and the founder of the Judahite dynasty. The story of David and Goliath remains one of the most iconic and beloved stories in the Bible and serves as a reminder of the power of faith in triumphing over seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"question":"Все тексты песен Lowe Nick представлены вам Lyrics-Keeper.

The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces. He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined. How much caffeine did he consume?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the caffeine content of the first drink. John drinks a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine. Step 2: Calculate the caffeine content per ounce for the first drink. Caffeine content per ounce of the first drink = Total caffeine content / Drink size = 250 grams / 12 ounces = 20.8333 grams/ounce (approximately) Step 3: Calculate the caffeine content per ounce for the second drink. The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink. Caffeine content per ounce of the second drink = 3 * (Caffeine content per ounce of the first drink) = 3 * 20.8333 grams/ounce = 62.5 grams/ounce Step 4: Calculate the total caffeine content of the second drink. The second drink is 2 ounces. Total caffeine content of the second drink = (Caffeine content per ounce of the second drink) * Drink size = 62.5 grams/ounce * 2 ounces = 125 grams Step 5: Calculate the total caffeine content of the two drinks. Total caffeine content of both drinks = (Caffeine content of the first drink) + (Caffeine content of the second drink) = 250 grams + 125 grams = 375 grams Step 6: Calculate the caffeine content of the caffeine pill. The caffeine pill has as much caffeine as the two drinks combined, so it has 375 grams of caffeine. Step 7: Calculate the total caffeine consumption. Total caffeine consumed = (Total caffeine content of both drinks) + (Caffeine content of the caffeine pill) = 375 grams + 375 grams = 750 grams So, John consumed a total of 750 grams of caffeine."},{"question":"Information: - Bogislaw X of Pomerania, \\"the Great\\", (3 June 1454 5 October 1523) was Duke of Pomerania from 1474 until his death in 1523. - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

Cronauer is greeted by Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker). Cronauer's irreverence contrasts sharply with many staff members and soon rouses the ire of two of his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming, while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor (Noble Willingham) and the other DJs quickly grow to like the new man and his brand of comedy. Cronauer's show consists of unpredictable humor segments mixed with news updates (vetted by the station censors) and rock and roll records that are frowned upon by his superiors. Cronauer meets Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a Vietnamese girl, and follows her to an English class. Bribing the teacher to let him take over the job, Cronauer starts instructing the students in the use of American slang. Once class is dismissed, he tries to talk to Trinh but is stopped by her brother Tuan. Instead, Cronauer befriends Tuan and takes him to Jimmy Wah's, the local GI bar, to have drinks with Garlick and the station staff. Two other soldiers, angered at Tuan's presence, initiate a confrontation that Cronauer escalates into a brawl. Dickerson reprimands Cronauer for this incident, but his broadcasts continue as before. While relaxing in Jimmy Wah's one afternoon, he is pulled outside by Tuan, who says that Trinh likes him and wants to see him, moments before the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer badly shaken. The cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb; the news is censored, but... A:","response":"The title for the movie with this plot is \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\". It's an American war comedy film that was released in 1987, directed by Barry Levinson and written by Mitch Markowitz. The film stars Robin Williams as radio DJ Adrian Cronauer, who shakes up the status quo when he is assigned to the United States Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam. It blends elements of comedy and drama, as Cronauer's energetic humor and love for rock and roll music clash with the restrictive bureaucracy and the harsh realities of war. The performances, particularly Williams' improvisational radio broadcasts, garnered critical acclaim and the movie was a significant box office success."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks. - Strange Celebrity was a Christian rock band, formed in Nashville, Tennessee, composing of four members: Luke Brown (lead vocals, guitar), Rick Wilson (drums), Quinton Gibson (guitar), and Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar).

Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to Ratt, are laced with fast, technical guitar work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Scott retained the use of the name \\"Whitecross\\" while Carroll went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change. - Stryper is an American Christian heavy metal band from Orange County, California. The group's lineup consists of Michael Sweet (lead vocals, guitar), Oz Fox (guitar), Tim Gaines (bass guitar), and Robert Sweet (drums).

However, the exact date is not well-documented and somewhat speculative since historical accounts from this period are scarce. Bears were once abundant in the British Isles. They lived in densely wooded areas and played a crucial role in the ecosystem as apex predators. However, as human populations expanded, they began to clear forests for agriculture and settlements, severely reducing the natural habitats of these native creatures. Bears were also hunted extensively for their fur, meat, and for use in the traditional Roman sport of bear-baiting that continued into the Middle Ages and beyond. By the time the Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century, the wild bear population in Britain had already begun to decline significantly. Some accounts suggest that these large mammals were almost extinct in England by the 10th century, with sporadic reports of bears occurring in remote parts of the country. The arrival of the Normans in 1066 further exacerbated the situation due to their fondness for hunting. Based on these historical accounts and the significant decline in bear populations and suitable habitats, it is plausible that the last wild bear was killed in England around the early 11th century. However, no definitive records or specific dates have been identified, leaving room for a degree of uncertainty. Interestingly, the Eurasian brown bear's extinction in England has left an enduring legacy in the form of place names, such as \\"Bernwood\\" in Buckinghamshire and \\"Barhill\\" in Warwickshire, which hint at the once-flourishing native bear communities. Conservation efforts in modern times focus on protecting and reintroducing the Eurasian brown bear in other parts of Europe, where the species still exists in small, isolated populations."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

But without any further information about the context or point of comparison, it's hard to determine what is exactly less expensive or to what it is being compared. The hypothesis states that \\"It's much more expensive that way,\\" suggesting that a certain way or method is more expensive. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

In the context, it is mentioned that Casey wanted alcohol to drink at the Super Bowl party tonight. Since Casey is looking to obtain alcohol, the most logical step for them to take is to go to a place where they can purchase the desired item, which, in this case, would be the liquor store. Answer B directly addresses Casey's desire to acquire alcohol for the party and is therefore the best option. Answer A: \\"buy some wine\\" is somewhat relevant, as it involves purchasing alcohol. However, it is too specific regarding the type of alcohol (wine), as the context does not mention any preferences or limitations on the type of alcohol Casey wishes to acquire. It could be that Casey is interested in buying beer, spirits, or other types of alcoholic beverages, which makes this answer less suitable compared to answer B. Answer C: \\"eat plenty so that he doesn't get too drunk\\" is not an appropriate response to the question in this context, as it does not address Casey's desire to obtain alcohol for the party.

Established in 1941, El Rancho Vegas was the very first casino resort on the famous Las Vegas Strip. The architecture and design of this groundbreaking hotel were hugely influential in shaping the future development of the Las Vegas Strip. Wayne McAllister was an influential American architect in the mid-20th century, known for designing iconic hotels, restaurants, and casinos. His signature style was a blend of modernism, Googie architecture, and Streamline Moderne design, reflecting the enthusiasm and optimism of the post-war American culture. He is credited with creating countless architectural masterpieces, displaying the sleek and futuristic designs characteristic of his work. El Rancho Vegas featured a sprawling complex of low-rise buildings reflecting the quintessential Southwest ranch style architecture. The resort was spread across 66 acres and offered a variety of amenities and facilities that attracted tourists from across the nation. Some of these facilities included upscale accommodations, dining options, a casino, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and a well-known showroom called the Opera House, which later became synonymous with top-tier entertainment in Las Vegas. El Rancho Vegas was more than just a casino and hotel; it set a precedent for the entertainment and hospitality industry in Las Vegas. The resort introduced the concept of providing a comprehensive, all-in-one package of accommodations, dining, gaming, and live entertainment for guests. As a result, the hotel quickly gained recognition for its world-class performances from the likes of Lena Horne, Sophie Tucker, and Perry Como, attracting both domestic and international visitors. Unfortunately, El Rancho Vegas faced a tragic end when it burned down in a massive fire on June 17, 1960. What was once a symbol of opulence and luxury turned into ruins overnight, marking the loss of a historic gem in Nevada's bling city. Despite its untimely demise, the legacy of El Rancho Vegas lives on - through various new resorts and casinos on the Las Vegas Strip that have adopted the ground-breaking model of combining luxurious accommodations, world-class entertainment, and fine dining options in a single location, a concept popularized by Wayne McAllister's architectural masterpiece, El Rancho Vegas."},{"question":"I love horror movies.

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

It is represented in Westminster by Barbara Keeley MP for Worsley and Eccles South. The 2011 Census recorded a population of 9,532. Hypothesis: The people of Boothstown and Ellenbrook enjoy living in England","response":"Based on the given paragraph, it cannot be definitively determined whether the people of Boothstown and Ellenbrook enjoy living in England or not. The information provided focuses on the political and administrative aspects of the area and includes details such as the creation of the ward, its representation in Westminster, and its population count as recorded in the 2011 Census. To evaluate the hypothesis that the people of Boothstown and Ellenbrook enjoy living in England, we would need information that specifically concerns the residents' satisfaction levels, their quality of life, or any data that might reflect their experiences or opinions related to living in this particular area in England. This information might include, but not be limited to, data on the overall happiness or life satisfaction indices of the residents, which could be obtained through surveys. Additionally, information related to employment opportunities, education, healthcare, community facilities, crime rates, and other relevant factors could help determine the extent to which people enjoy living in Boothstown and Ellenbrook. In conclusion, based on the given paragraph, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed or rejected as there is insufficient information pertaining to the residents' welfare, satisfaction, or their thoughts and opinions on living in Boothstown and Ellenbrook. In order to better assess the hypothesis, the compilation of additional data relevant to people's feelings, experiences and overall quality of life in this area would be a necessity."},{"question":"Warning: This review contains a spoiler.

METHODS: We searched and reviewed cited references up to August 2013 to identify relevant studies. Corresponding authors of selected studies were contacted and asked to provide additional quantitative details. Data from each study were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. The cumulative prevalence of presenting features and comorbidities was assessed. Nineteen studies whose authors sent the requested information were included in the systematic review, with a total of 1109 patients (951 women; mean age, 59-76 years). Evaluation of risk factors showed that obesity was present in 17% of patients (range, 2%-48%), hypertension in 54% (range, 27%-83%), dyslipidemia in 32% (range, 7%-59%), diabetes in 17% (range, 4%-34%), and smoking in 22% (range, 6%-49%). Emotional stressors preceded takotsubo syndrome in 39% of patients and physical stressors in 35%. The most common comorbidities were psychological disorders (24%; range, 0-49%), pulmonary diseases (15%; range, 0-22%), and malignancies (10%; range, 4%-29%). Other common associated disorders were neurologic diseases (7%; range, 0-22%), chronic kidney disease (7%; range, 2%-27%), and thyroid diseases (6%; range, 0-37%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with takotsubo syndrome have a relevant prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and associated comorbidities. Such of associations needs to be evaluated in further studies.

It’s been just a couple of decades since doctors began recognizing and diagnosing the heart condition called broken heart syndrome, or tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. At first, it was not taken as seriously as other heart conditions, though it mimics a heart attack and can be serious — even fatal. “It’s not as benign a condition as originally thought,” says Scott Sharkey, MD, a research cardiologist at the Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation, and can lead to cardiac arrest. People with other medical conditions like obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and smoking are more likely to experience tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, reports a review of clinical studies in the American Journal of Medicine, February 2015. Related: How to Stay Young at Heart and Keep Your Blood Pressure Low Symptoms of ‘Broken Heart Syndrome’ Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy, was first recognized in Japan in 1991. It is more frequent among women; men make up only 10 percent of the cases. Symptoms occur abruptly and can include chest pain and sudden shortness of breath. Though a tragic event is often the trigger, symptoms can appear out of the blue in a small number of cases. The condition has even been reported after receiving unexpected good news. “Stress cardiomyopathy implies everyone has a stressful event, but about 15 percent of patients do not,” Dr. Sharkey says. People with the condition usually have abnormal results on an echocardiogram test. To definitively diagnose the condition, doctors administer an angiogram to rule out blocked arteries. They will also use a cardiac MRI or CT scan to examine the heart’s left ventricle, which contracts in a distinct way with tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. Related: Is It Normal Female Aging, or a Heart Condition? The heart’s abnormal contractions are treatable and usually go away after one to four weeks, Sharkey says. “Part of the diagnosis of the condition requires that that occur. So sometimes the diagnosis can only be done with certainty after time has passed.” Heart Failure and Tako-tsubo Cardiomyopathy Sharkey and his colleagues examined the medical histories of more than 200 tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy patients at the Minneapolis Heart Institute. They identified a small group of patients who also had severe heart failure and low blood pressure. These patients received aggressive treatments, like medications to increase blood pressure, and breathing machines. Of the 45 patients in that group, 9 died despite the medical interventions. All of the patients who died were female, and all had other risks such as advanced-stage cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, advanced age, or bleeding on the brain. Related: Few Patients Get the ‘Sex Talk’ After a Heart Attack The overall in-hospital mortality rate of the 45 patients with both tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy and severe heart failure was 20 percent. This is higher than the typical in-hospital mortality rate of patients with both heart failure and myocardial infarction, or heart attack. The study’s results are important, Sharkey says, as a step toward determining the true seriousness of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. “The true mortality rate is only becoming manifest as we have a broader experience with this,” Sharkey says. The good news is that tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy patients, who do not have medical conditions other than heart failure, survive. This indicates that otherwise healthy people are likely to recover from broken heart syndrome even if they have heart failure along with it, Sharkey says. Clinical reports confirm that in-hospital deaths from tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy are rare. Related: 4 Nuts That Cut Your Heart Disease Risk Sharkey hopes that the medical community will devise more complete guidelines for treating people with broken heart syndrome, including which drugs are most effective. Aggressive treatment for heart failure and broken heart syndrome will be successful in the vast majority of cases, Sharkey adds. Patients’ families can take comfort in the fact that their loved ones will likely survive an experience with tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. “Even though they look very ill, if they do not have some other serious medical condition that is contributing to their state of health, then this is a very survivable event,” Sharkey says. ||||| Most Chicagoans have at least adapted to the bone-chilling temps we get each holiday season.

METHODS: We evaluated 19 patients who presented with left ventricular dysfunction after sudden emotional stress. All patients underwent coronary angiography and serial echocardiography; five underwent endomyocardial biopsy. Plasma catecholamine levels in 13 patients with stress-related myocardial dysfunction were compared with those in 7 patients with Killip class III myocardial infarction. RESULTS: The median age of patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy was 63 years, and 95 percent were women. Clinical presentations included chest pain, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock. Diffuse T-wave inversion and a prolonged QT interval occurred in most patients. Seventeen patients had mildly elevated serum troponin I levels, but only 1 of 19 had angiographic evidence of clinically significant coronary disease. Severe left ventricular dysfunction was present on admission (median ejection fraction, 0.20; interquartile range, 0.15 to 0.30) and rapidly resolved in all patients (ejection fraction at two to four weeks, 0.60; interquartile range, 0.55 to 0.65; P<0.001). Endomyocardial biopsy showed mononuclear infiltrates and contraction-band necrosis. Plasma catecholamine levels at presentation were markedly higher among patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy than among those with Killip class III myocardial infarction (median epinephrine level, 1264 pg per milliliter [interquartile range, 916 to 1374] vs. 376 pg per milliliter [interquartile range, 275 to 476]; norepinephrine level, 2284 pg per milliliter [interquartile range, 1709 to 2910] vs. 1100 pg per milliliter [interquartile range, 914 to 1320]; and dopamine level, 111 pg per milliliter [interquartile range, 106 to 146] vs. 61 pg per milliliter [interquartile range, 46 to 77]; P<0.005 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Emotional stress can precipitate severe, reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients without coronary disease. Exaggerated sympathetic stimulation is probably central to the cause of this syndrome.

Let's first determine the worth of the portion of his share that he sold: Amount sold = 1/10 of his share Value of amount sold = 460 Now, we will find the worth of the man's entire share before selling 1/10 of it. 1/10 of his share = 460 So, 1 share (complete ownership) would be = 460 * 10 Since the man owned half of the lot, the value of his entire share is 1/2 of the complete ownership (1 share). Value of man's entire share = (460 * 10) / 2 Now, we know that the man owned half of the lot, so the entire lot's worth would be double of his entire share: Value of entire lot = Value of man's entire share * 2 Combining these equations, we can calculate the value of the entire lot: Value of entire lot = ((460 * 10) / 2) * 2 Solving this equation, we get: Value of entire lot = 460 * 10 = 4,600 Hence, the worth of the entire lot is 4,600."},{"question":"One evening,June Griffith was on her way to pick up her son.Almost immediately,she realized that she had gone the wrong way.She'd driven onto railroad tracks and the underside of her car was caught.

Individuals from which species, the antelope or the bison, will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior? In the sub-Saharan African country of Nigeria, there are two main species that tend to travel in groups. The antelope tend to travel in groups in high numbers, and thus exhibit a high density. Meanwhile, the bison tend to travel in groups of small numbers, and therefore exhibit low density. Both the antelope and the bison have natural predators that exist in Nigeria. Hint: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, individuals from the bison species will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior.

But that's exactly what's been happening for several weeks all around New England at Market Basket grocery stores. In 1916, Athanasios and Efrosini Demoulas, who immigrated to the United States from Greece, opened a grocery store in Lowell, Massachusetts. Almost a century later, the family has expanded it to a chain of 71 supermarkets across Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. In 2008, Anthanasios and Efrosini's grandson Arthur T. Demoulas was elected president of the Market Basket board. By all accounts, Arthur T., as he is known, presided over a very successful and happy company. Not only did Market Basket continue to expand and reap profits â€” generating 4 billion in revenues in 2012 â€” but workers have thrived as well. Full-time clerks start at 12 an hour. Cashiers with experience can earn over 40,000 a year. And managers can easily make into the six figures. Keep in mind that's in a nation where the average annual salary for grocery store cashiers is 21,370 and the national minimum wage is 7.25 per hour. The company also has a generous retirement plan, matching 15% of annual salary to employee retirement funds. What's more, workers up and down the supply chain receive good bonuses throughout the year. All this and Market Basket is affordable for customers, with prices regularly 10% to 20% lower than competitors. The company is profitable in an industry known for low profit margins, and has given 500 million in dividends to the nine family shareholders over the past decade. In other words, at a time when corporate executives and wealthy investors regularly try to argue that companies cannot pay workers well and be successful in generating profits, Market Basket has been an impressive and stunning example to the contrary. Market Basket has been a good company all around -- until recently, when things changed. So what happened? Well, the family board switched sides, ousted Arthur T. and installed his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas as president. One of the first acts under Arthur S. was to distribute 250 million in profits to the nine family shareholders, what a Boston Globe editorial called \\"an uncharacteristic act of greed for a firm known for its generous treatment of its workers and concern for price-conscious shoppers.\\" There have been other ominous signs that Arthur S. and his allies plan to push profit at all costs -- at the expense of workers and the values of the company. And so in an unprecedented mobilization, managers and workers have protested at Market Baskets across New England, calling for their beloved CEO Artie T. to be reinstated. Last week, more than 6,000 Market Basket workers and managers joined in a peaceful march outside the company's headquarters in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. If you go to any Market Basket store around New England right now, you're likely to find employees and even some customers holding up signs protesting the new executive and supporting the ousted Artie T. Employees are also using social media to get their message out, using hashtags like #MarketBasket. Of course, if you go inside a Market Basket you're not likely to find much; even the warehouse workers are on strike. These protests aren't being organized by unions; after all, Market Basket workers aren't unionized. They're being organized by the employees and managers of the company. Already, eight managers have been fired for helping lead the protests. But the protests continue. As a result, the company is reportedly losing 1 million a day. A reporter interviewed one of the Market Basket workers at a protest. \\"I have a friend who works at Walmart,\\" she said, \\"and I asked her, would they ever do this for their CEO?\\" The woman laughed. But what has become of capitalism in America is not funny: the extreme greed of a few overrunning the best interests of everyone, including workers, communities and a healthy growing economy. Just like the Occupy Wall Street protesters before them, the Market Basket workers are not protesting against capitalism. They're protesting for a certain kind of capitalism, a capitalism that works for owners as well as for workers and communities. It's the kind of capitalism that has made Market Basket a successful business for generations, the kind of capitalism that once meant shared prosperity and opportunity in America. The Market Basket managers and cashiers and bag boys joining in protest aren't just holding signs, they're also holding the aspirations of the majority of Americans. Those of us concerned about the growing economic inequality in America don't want to \\"eat the rich\\" â€” we simply don't want the rich to chew up and spit out everyone else. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Market Basket is a chain of 71 supermarkets in New England, known for treating its workers exceptionally well, with high salaries, good bonuses, and a generous retirement plan. They have managed to be a successful and profitable business with affordable prices for customers despite these employee benefits. However, recently, the company's board ousted Arthur T. Demoulas, a popular president who cared for employee welfare, and installed his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas as president. Under Arthur S., the company has taken actions that are more focused on profits at the expense of the workers and company values. In response, an unprecedented mobilization of employees and managers have been protesting at Market Basket stores across New England, calling for the reinstatement of Arthur T. Demoulas as CEO. This protest is not against capitalism, but rather in support of a fair and balanced capitalism that promotes shared prosperity and works for both owners and employees."},{"question":"Carter has a 14-hour road trip. He wants to stop every 2 hours to stretch his legs. He also wants to make 2 additional stops for food and 3 additional stops for gas. If each pit stop takes 20 minutes, how many hours will his road trip become? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"1. Calculate the number of stretch breaks Carter will take. 2. Calculate the total number of pit stops (stretch breaks + food stops + gas stops). 3. Calculate the total time spent on pit stops. 4. Add the total time spent on pit stops to the initial 14-hour road trip. 1. Number of stretch breaks: Carter wants to stop every 2 hours, so the total number of stretch breaks will be 14 hours / 2 hours = 7 stretch breaks. 2. Total number of pit stops: We already have 7 stretch breaks, 2 food stops, and 3 gas stops, so the total number of pit stops will be 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 pit stops. 3. Total time spent on pit stops: Each pit stop takes 20 minutes, so the total time spent on pit stops will be 12 pit stops * 20 minutes per pit stop = 240 minutes. To convert this to hours, we need to divide 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours. 4. Updated road trip duration: Now we'll add the 4 hours spent on pit stops to the initial 14-hour road trip: 14 hours + 4 hours = 18 hours. So, Carter's road trip will now take 18 hours, including all pit stops."},{"question":"Bovegno is a \\"comune\\" in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\", is \\"asked Riley to take charge but Riley was inexperienced\\" a valid answer? Answer:","response":"No, \\"asked Riley to take charge but Riley was inexperienced\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\". The given sentence only describes the situation and the reason behind Riley's poor performance, but it does not provide any information on the possible consequences or future outcomes for Riley. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\" could be: The outcome for Riley will depend on various factors, including how Aubrey and other team members react to the situation, the support and guidance that Riley receives, and Riley's own ability to learn and grow from this experience. 1. Aubrey's reaction: Aubrey's response to Riley's poor performance will play a significant role in determining what happens to Riley. If Aubrey is understanding and recognizes that Riley needs more guidance and support, they may offer to mentor Riley or pair them with a more experienced team member to help build their skills. Alternatively, Aubrey might decide to assign Riley a different role or responsibility more suited to their current skill level. 2. Team members' reaction: The reaction of other team members to Riley's performance can also influence Riley's future at the company. If the team is supportive and understanding, Riley may have an opportunity to learn from their mistake and improve their performance in the future. However, if the team is not supportive or does not trust Riley's ability to improve, it could lead to a negative work environment and potentially harm Riley's career growth. 3. Riley's willingness to learn and grow: Another crucial factor in determining what will happen to Riley is their personal attitude and willingness to learn from their mistakes. If Riley is proactive in seeking feedback, developing their skills, and adapting their work methods, they may overcome their inexperience and eventually excel in their role. On the other hand, if Riley is unwilling to accept responsibility for their mistakes and does not take steps to improve, they may continue to struggle and face negative consequences, such as being removed from their current position or having difficulty advancing in their career. 4. Support and resources provided to Riley: The resources and support Riley has access to will also significantly impact their ability to grow and succeed. If the company provides training opportunities, mentorship programs, or other resources that help Riley develop their skills, they will be more likely to overcome their inexperience and become a valuable asset to the team. If these resources are not provided or are limited, Riley may continue to face challenges in their role. Overall, the outcome for Riley will be dependent on multiple factors, and it is essential to consider these aspects when determining what will happen to them. A supportive environment, opportunities for growth, and a willingness to learn and adapt can help Riley overcome their inexperience and achieve success."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are presented with a term, a description of the term, and an expected answer ('yes' or 'no').

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"A: The supposed perturbation is directly impacting a step of the process. When animals die in wetter soil, it can lead to more fossils forming because the soft, wet soil or mud helps to preserve the remains of the animals and plants better than in dry conditions.

The two books in focus are \\"A Long Long Way\\" and \\"The Secret Scripture,\\" both situated within the cultural milieu of Ireland and rendering narratives grounded in the Irish experience. \\"A Long Long Way,\\" whose narrative progression is succeeded by \\"The Secret Scripture,\\" presents a vivid panorama of Ireland's socio-cultural dynamics. The follow-up, \\"The Secret Scripture,\\" takes the conversation ahead, further enriching readers with its portrayals of life in Ireland. Creating a sentence from this data, we could say that, \\"In Ireland, a country with the ethnic group majorly comprising of white people and its largest city being Dublin, we find an intriguing exploration of its socio-cultural narrative through the published works of Faber and Faber - 'A Long Long Way' which is followed by 'The Secret Scripture'.” Both these books, that form a series of sorts and share a common publisher, Faber and Faber, navigate the tapestry of Ireland's culture, heritage, and people. Ireland, known for its scenic beauty and rich cultural history, primarily consists of white ethnic group; this demographic detail contributes to the backdrop against which these narratives unfold, adding an extra layer of cultural observation and critique. Dublin, being the largest city in Ireland, implicitly becomes a significant spatial reference in the books, its spirit encapsulated through the nuanced descriptions, incidents, and shared histories experienced by the characters. As such, these narratives capture the city's distinct ethos, transforming Dublin from a mere geographical location to a living, breathing character in these novels. In summary, the data constructs a holistic cultural, literary, and geographical portrait of Ireland, encapsulating its ethnic demographic, literary works, and socio-cultural atmosphere anchored down to its largest city, Dublin. All these elements intertwined present a comprehensive demonstration of Ireland's distinctive identity and experience, as captured in the two books published by Faber and Faber - 'A Long Long Way' and 'The Secret Scripture.'

Although these terms are often used interchangeably, dark-skinned doesn't necessarily mean black, as it can refer to a wide range of skin tones. Therefore, this part of the comparison is not entirely accurate. 2. \\"In a green shirt with a green scarf\\" vs. \\"Clad in green\\": Clad in green implies the man is wearing green clothing, which is true, as the original sentence describes him wearing a green shirt and a green scarf. This part of the comparison is accurate. 3. \\"Looking at an electronic device\\" vs. \\"Looking at a gadget\\": The terms \\"electronic device\\" and \\"gadget\\" are generally used interchangeably, with both describing devices that have an electronic component. In this context, it would be reasonable to consider this part of the comparison accurate.

Movie title: Puss in Boots Context: Sometime before Puss (Antonio Banderas) meets Shrek and Donkey in Shrek 2, he arrives at a town while escaping a bounty hunter. There he learns that the outlaw couple Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, beans that can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a masked cat (Salma Hayek) interrupts. Both fail and escape, and Puss follows the cat back to Cat Cantina, a club, where they have a dance-off and a sword fight, ending when Puss hits the masked cat in the head with a guitar.

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah. So, beginning Monday there will be two doctors in the office. That should take a little pressure off.

His most famous writings are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\", and the poem The Hunting of the Snark - all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. Dodgson's family was predominantly northern English, with Irish connections, conservative and High Church Anglican. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or Church of England clergy. His great-grandfather, also named Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin. His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies. The older of these sons - yet another Charles Dodgson - was Carroll's father. He went to Westminster School and then to Christ Church, Oxford. He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1827 and became a country parson. Dodgson was born in the small parsonage at Daresbury in Cheshire near the towns of Warrington and Runcorn, the eldest boy but already the third child of the four-and-a-half-year-old marriage. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the living of Croft-on-Tees in North Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years. Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the Archdeacon of Richmond and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high church, inclining to Anglo-Catholicism, an admirer of John Henry Newman and the Tractarian movement, and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambiguous relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole. The young adult Charles Dodgson was about 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat asymmetrical, and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of whooping cough, which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his \\"hesitation\\", a stammer that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life. The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. It is said that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, but there is no evidence to support this idea. Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the Dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many \\"facts\\" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation. Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at charades. In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. Martin Gardner labels Dodgson as a Tory who was \\"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\\" The Reverend W. Tuckwell, in his Reminiscences of Oxford (1900), regarded him as \\"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\\" Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on December 22, 1861. In The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, the editor states that \\"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\\" When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \\"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\\". He added: I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us--our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another--we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to--that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \\"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\\" Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research, and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \\"thought reading\\". Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of Mind. The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by Simon Blackburn titled \\"Practical Tortoise Raising\\". Did his views affect his work?","response":"Yes, Charles Dodgson's views and personal experiences did have an impact on his work, often in subtle and indirect ways. As an author, mathematician, logician, and Anglican deacon, his writings and ideas often reflected his beliefs, interests, and the life he led. Here are some of the ways in which his views and experiences influenced his work: 1. Literary Nonsense and Wordplay: Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, was a master of literary nonsense and wordplay. His most famous works, such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, and the poem The Hunting of the Snark, are rich in puns, paradoxes, and seemingly nonsensical verses. His fascination with language and logic can be seen in the way he played with words and created surreal situations in his writings, which might be partially inspired by his struggles with his stammer and finding ways to communicate effectively. 2. Religious Themes: As an Anglican deacon, Dodgson's religious beliefs did appear in some of his works. The Hunting of the Snark, for instance, contains references to the religious concept of redemption and forgiveness. Similarly, his adherence to High Church Anglican principles is also demonstrated in Sylvie and Bruno, one of his lesser-known works, which includes themes of faith, virtue, and the importance of prayer. 3. Mathematical and Logical Puzzles: Dodgson's passion for mathematics and logic is evident in his writings as well. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the characters Alice encounters and the challenges she faces are often underpinned by mathematical concepts. For example, Alice's changes in size can be seen as a metaphor for understanding mathematical concepts such as ratio and proportion. Furthermore, the puzzles and riddles featured in his works, including \\"The Mad Hatter's Tea Party,\\" encompass logical brainteasers that require readers to think critically. 4. Exploration of Identity and Personal Experience: Dodgson's personal experiences and his struggles with his stammer, as well as the question of identity, are also present in his works. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice's journey can be seen as a symbolic exploration of identity and personal growth, where she tries to make sense of the nonsensical world around her. Moreover, some scholars speculate that Dodgson might have identified with the character of the Dodo, who has difficulty pronouncing his name, as a reflection of his own problems with pronunciation because of his stammer. 5. Conservative Views: While his conservative political and religious views are not always overt in his works, they nonetheless set the tone and context for some of his writings. His conservative approach to life and strict adherence to social norms informed his storytelling, which often revolved around questioning and challenging established norms and assumptions, while still rooting his stories in a traditional, Victorian sense of propriety. In conclusion, Charles Dodgson's views, beliefs, and personal experiences indeed influenced his work in various ways, shaping not only the content but also the themes and stylistic choices within his writings. As a result, his body of work can be seen as a reflection of his multifaceted personality and the diverse range of interests he pursued throughout his life."},{"question":"Todd Menzing called me up a few days ago to ask if he could send a letter to me about what I understand to be his representation of a former Enron employee against us in an HR matter.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane.

Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"First, let's look at both questions separately. Question 1: How do I finish 4 essays in 3 days? Step 1: Determine the total hours available in 3 days, assuming 8 hours of focused work each day: 3 days * 8 hours/day = 24 hours Step 2: Divide the total time by the number of essays. 24 hours / 4 essays = 6 hours/essay Step 3: Allocate 6 hours for researching, writing, and editing each essay, since each essay should take equal time. Step 4: Work on each essay for 6 hours, one essay per day while completing one-third of the fourth essay. Step 5: On the third day, after finishing the third essay, complete the remaining two-thirds of the fourth essay. Now let's look at the second question: Question 2: 3 men or 4 women can do a piece of work in 43 days, then how long will 7 men and 5 women together will take to finish the same work? Step 1: Calculate one man's and one woman's work per day by assuming that 3 men = 4 women. If 3 men take 43 days to finish the work, in one day they complete 1/43 of the work. Therefore, one man completes (1/43)/3 = 1/129 of the work in a day. Since 3 men = 4 women, one woman completes (1/43)/4 = 1/172 of the work in a day. Step 2: Calculate the combined work rate of 7 men and 5 women. 7 men = 7 * (1/129), and 5 women = 5 * (1/172). Add these two rates to find the combined rate: 7*(1/129) + 5*(1/172) = 7/129 + 5/172 = (7*172 + 5*129)/(129*172) = (1194 + 645) / (22188) = 1839/22188. Step 3: Calculate how long it will take 7 men and 5 women to complete the work at their combined work rate. Since they complete 1839/22188 of the work in a day, the time they take to complete the work is 22188/1839 = 12 days. To answer your question about whether these questions are the same: No, they are not the same. The first question is about dividing available time between tasks and organizing your work, while the second question deals with solving work rate problems involving different groups working together."},{"question":"\\"The Best Things in Life Are Free\\" is a duet between American singers Luther Vandross and Janet Jackson, recorded for the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis-produced soundtrack to the 1992 American film, Mo' Money, starring Damon Wayans.

There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant. A:","response":"The last names of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude are Stoichita and Coderch."},{"question":"Algerian tulevaisuus ei varmasti ole taattu, jos demokratiapyrkimykset tukahdutetaan ja estetään lehdistön vapaus, vaan päinvastoin ottamalla huomioon ne usein hyvin rohkeat toimet, joita toteuttavat erilaiset yhteenliittymät, jotka esimerkiksi puolustavat naisten oikeuksia, vaativat perhelain kumoamista, hoitavat väkivallan traumatisoimia lapsia tai puolustavat ihmisoikeuksia.

It does not provide any clear indication of the man's emotional state or the reason behind his action. The man could be throwing the cards in the air out of anger, as the hypothesis suggests. However, there could be other possible explanations for this behavior. For example, the man might be throwing the cards in the air as a gesture of excitement, celebration, or surprise. He might also be attempting to perform a magic trick or some other entertaining action. Without more context, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis.

A deer jumps a fence. A deer jumping over a fence. Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\".","response":"I would rate the similarity between the sentences \\"A deer jumps a fence\\" and \\"A deer jumping over a fence\\" as a 4 on the scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\". The reason for this rating is that both sentences convey the action of a deer jumping over a fence. However, there are some subtle differences between the two sentences. The first sentence, \\"A deer jumps a fence\\", is in the simple present tense, and it describes a specific event in which a deer is jumping a fence. This could imply that the speaker is observing the event happening at present, or describing a habit or general action. The second sentence, \\"A deer jumping over a fence\\", is a noun phrase, with \\"jumping\\" acting as a present participle. It is describing a deer in the process of jumping over a fence, without necessarily relating the action to a specific time or event. This phrase can be used in various contexts – for instance, as a caption for a photo or as part of a longer sentence. So while both sentences communicate the same general idea – that a deer is leaping over a fence – the grammatical structure and implied context slightly differ. Nevertheless, they remain very similar in their overall meaning."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Personally I enjoy doing things outside. You know, the good ol’ nature. One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

The primary source of pollution in the city has been a combination of rapid industrialization and an increase in private vehicles on the roads. This situation has caused an alarming decrease in air quality, contributing to serious health problems for the residents. A government report suggests that the primary pollutants detected in the atmosphere are particulates, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone. The government and the citizens are increasingly concerned about the environmental and health implications of the mounting air pollution. There have been discussions on various ways to tackle this issue, such as stricter regulations on industries, implementation of public transportation systems, initiatives to encourage carpooling, the adoption of electric vehicles, and promotion of greener technologies. Hypothesis: Implementing congestion pricing in the city's central district in tandem with expanding and improving public transportation systems could significantly reduce the air pollution levels. Such a solution would charge vehicle owners for entering or parking in the central district, effectively discouraging unnecessary trips and encouraging the use of public transportation. As a result, there would be fewer vehicles in the city center, leading to a reduction in traffic congestion and the overall emissions of pollutants. Additionally, the funds generated through congestion pricing could be invested in developing and enhancing the public transportation system, making it more accessible, efficient, and appealing to the citizens. Improvements might include the expansion of metro lines, adding more bus routes, cycle rental schemes, and better integration between different modes of transport. Consequently, the combination of congestion pricing and an improved public transportation system could lead to a behavior change in the city's residents. With fewer trips being made by private vehicles and increased use of environmentally-friendly public transportation, air quality would improve, leading to better health outcomes and a more sustainable urban environment. In order to verify this hypothesis, further research and data collection would be necessary, such as conducting surveys on residents' transportation preferences and behavior, studying similar policies in other cities, and analyzing air pollution trends over time. Additionally, the government could implement pilot projects to observe the impact on congestion and air quality before fully committing to the policy."},{"question":"Please answer this question: list of countries having pound as their currency?","response":"The pound is a unit of currency used in several countries worldwide. While the British Pound Sterling is the most well-known \\"pound\\" currency, there are other countries and territories where the pound is their official currency.

Ahora siento una felicidad que no puedo ni explicar\\", confiesa el reggaetonero HÃ©ctor El Father. Su verdadero nombre es HÃ©ctor Delgado, y desde hace cinco meses es miembro de la iglesia cristiana Pentecostal Misionera en Puerto Rico. El nuevo cristiano reconoce que su vida personal y artÃ­stica ha cambiado totalmente, al punto que se reconciliÃ³ con Jennifer Ca-rrasquillo, madre de su hijo HÃ©ctor Joel, y ahora su esposa legal. En cuanto a la parte artÃ­stica, lanzÃ³ su primer disco cristiano, \\"El juicio final\\". \\"En este disco se pueden encontrar canciones para entender que Cristo es el camino. Ahora tengo una vida eterna que no tiene comparaciÃ³n, vivo para dar un mensaje que Dios aportÃ³ en mi corazÃ³n para esta humanidad\\". Con mÃ¡s reserva y tal vez mÃ¡s aÃ±os de tradiciÃ³n, en casa de RamÃ³n Ayala, conocido como Daddy Yankee, se practica el cristianismo, y uno de sus hermanos, Melvin Ayala, es pastor cristiano. \\"En mi caso no es que quiera seguir a mi hermano, pero sÃ­ quiero seguir al SeÃ±or, que es lo importante. A mi hermano lo respeto y lo amo, pero cuando uno va a la iglesia uno tiene que seguir al SeÃ±or\\", dice. Aunque no tiene planes de incluir mÃºsica religiosa en sus discos, reconoce que su fe surgiÃ³ en momentos difÃ­ciles en su vida, cuando a los 17 aÃ±os fue herido por una bala en su pierna derecha y quedÃ³ cojo de por vida, aunque aprendiÃ³ a disimular a la perfecciÃ³n este problema. \\"Gracias a Dios, a pesar de que tengo esta limitaciÃ³n fÃ­sica, no dejo que eso me domine ni pienso que me vaya a ser mÃ¡s dÃ©bil\\", declara.

Sentence A: \\"I am on the plane\\" This sentence implies that the speaker is inside or on board the plane, most likely traveling somewhere. It makes sense, as people often travel by plane, and this is a coherent way to describe being on a mode of transportation. 2. Sentence B: \\"I an on the wings of the plane\\" First, there is a typo in this sentence - \\"an\\" should be replaced with \\"am\\" to be grammatically correct. With that correction, the sentence reads \\"I am on the wings of the plane.\\" This sentence implies that the speaker is physically on the wings of a plane, which is typically an impossible scenario for an average person; it is not a typical place for a person to be on a plane. Now that we have explored both sentences, Sentence B seems to not make sense, because it describes an unrealistic and improbable situation.

With a closed carriage and a band of chosen ruffians he had left the palace a good half-hour before the king's messengers, and by the aid of his sister's gold he had managed that their journey should not be a very rapid one. On reaching the branch road he had ordered the coachman to drive some little distance along it, and had tethered all the horses to a fence under his charge.

The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A group of college friends consisted of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Archâgather, celebrate spring break by spending the weekend at the island mansion of their friend and Skip's sister Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fools' Day. The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday. One after another, the group either vanishes or being killed and their bodies being found. Kit and Rob put together some clues and realizing that everyone's earlier assumption is wrong; the kinsman of the deckhand injured when they arrived is a red herring. It also turns out that Muffy has a violently insane twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped. In fact, the \\"Muffy\\" they have been around since the first night was Buffy, pretending to be Muffy.

A:","response":"In the movie April Fool's Day, Nikki finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch, as well as the dead body of Nan. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that there is an underlying mystery which involves Muffy, one of the characters, having a violently insane twin sister named Buffy. The plot takes a dark turn as the remaining group members begin to vanish or are found dead. The group of college friends - Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Arch - gather to celebrate Spring Break at the island mansion of their friend, and Skip's sister, Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fool's Day. Various pranks are set by Muffy, and as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that not all these jokes are as harmless as they initially appear. As characters in the group go missing, it becomes more urgent for the remaining friends to solve the mystery. Kit catches a glimpse of what appears to be Skip's dead body, and as search efforts intensify, Nikki falls into the island's well and discovers the severed heads of Skip and Arch, as well as Nan's dead body. With no way to leave the island and no working phones, the friends become increasingly desperate to uncover the truth behind the killings. As Kit and Rob delve deeper into the mystery, they begin to piece together clues that lead them to the revelation of Muffy having a twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped from a psychiatric facility and is posing as Muffy. In a twist, they find what they believe to be Muffy's severed head in the basement, and the chase with Buffy begins. The plot of April Fool's Day provides the tension of a horror film, mixed with elements of mystery, as the group of friends attempt to uncover the identity of the killer. It is important to consider the balance between the horror elements and the film's suspense before deciding whether or not to invest in the film proposal. Additionally, factors such as the overall budget, the attached talent, and the potential market for this type of film should also be taken into account to determine the potential return on investment."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Corncob<br>The girl saw corncobs were going to waste at the farm.

When they take the witness stand in a packed Pennsylvania courtroom as early as next week, the alleged victims will be forced to state their names for the record -- traumatizing them all over again, their lawyers and victims' advocates argue, especially given the very real possibility their identities will become common knowledge via social media and the wider Internet. Most traditional media organizations, including The Associated Press, have longstanding policies against using the names of alleged victims of sexual assault, viewing the crime as so intensely personal and the potential effect of public disclosure so traumatic for the accuser that withholding the identity outweighs the public's right to know. But in this anything-goes age of social media and citizen journalists, when anyone with a smartphone can tweet or blog, old media standards may no longer make much difference. Anyone lucky enough to grab one of the 85 courtroom seats reserved for the public could sit in for the day, jot down some of the accusers' names, leave and disseminate them to the world. \\"Most of us want to have some control over who we share intimate details of our lives with,\\" said Karen Baker, director of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \\"To have that out there on the Internet, you've totally lost control, and it's a scary thing.\\" Sandusky, 68, faces 52 counts accusing him of sexually abusing 10 boys over a span of 15 years. Prosecutors say the retired coach befriended boys he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded for youngsters in 1977, then attacked them, in some cases in his home or inside university athletic facilities. He has denied the allegations. Most of the accusers are now in their 20s. Up to now, they have been identified in court papers only as \\"Victim 1,\\" \\"Victim 2\\" and so on. Five of the eight alleged victims who could be called to the stand asked Judge John Cleland for permission to testify under pseudonyms, saying through their lawyers that exposing their names would subject them to shame, ridicule and harassment. An attorney for the accuser known as Victim 4 submitted an affidavit from his psychologist that said public disclosure could trigger symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and interfere with the young man's treatment and recovery. And a coalition of advocacy groups argued that removing the cloak of anonymity would have a chilling effect on victims' willingness to report abuse. Most childhood sexual abuse already goes unreported because young victims fear they will be ridiculed or disbelieved, the groups noted in a brief submitted to the judge. But the judge said there is no authority in Pennsylvania law to allow the alleged victims to remain anonymous. While state law shields the identities of child victims of sexual assault, it affords no explicit protection to adult accusers even if the abuse took place when they were children. Cleland also said there is a public policy consideration at stake. \\"Courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information,\\" he wrote. \\"Secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully.\\" With rare exception, Cleland said, all citizens have a duty to testify publicly, \\"no matter how personally unpleasant.\\" In the wake of that ruling, victims' organizations pleaded with the public and the media Thursday to exercise restraint. \\"Victims everywhere should know that their privacy will be respected when they come forward to reveal intimate details of sexual abuse. They participate in the criminal justice process in an effort to do the right thing and testify about their experiences; they should not have to worry about being publicly targeted when doing so,\\" said Baker's group and others said in a statement. John Giugliano, a clinical social worker and associate professor at Widener University, said victims of childhood sexual abuse can suffer anew when their names are publicized because the most humiliating episode of their lives is suddenly open to public inspection and judgment. Common symptoms of abuse -- depression, anxiety, substance abuse, difficulty connecting with others -- can flare up or become more severe, he said. Beth Docherty, who was 15 when her music teacher raped her, said she was grateful her name wasn't released. Even with the court's protection, though, a newspaper account contained just enough detail about her identity -- that she played flute -- that it became known within her school. She said the teacher's supporters sent her hate mail and broke her windows. Docherty, now 43 and president of the board of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, sees parallels with the Sandusky case. Just as she was blamed for reporting her attacker, Docherty said, some Penn State fans have blamed the accusers for football coach Joe Paterno's firing last fall, just months before his death from cancer. \\"You've gone through this horrible thing, and you have people who don't know you blaming you, saying you caused this icon to be brought down. It stays with you. It affects you for a long time,\\" she said. \\"Having that identity kept from the public is a little bit of a comfort, so I feel for them. It's going to be really traumatic, and I give them a lot of credit to still go through with it and not crush and crumble under all the pressure.\\" If the victims' names do become public knowledge during trial, it probably won't be the result of reporting by the traditional media. \\"We have a firm and longstanding policy not to publish the names of victims of sexual crimes without their consent,\\" Lawrence Beaupre, executive editor of Times-Shamrock Communications, said in an email. The media conglomerate publishes The Times-Tribune in Scranton and several other newspapers and has sent a reporter to the trial. More than 80 media outlets have been credentialed to cover the trial, from broadcast networks and major newspapers to Internet portals, independent journalists and tiny online news operations, some of which told AP that they, too, plan to withhold the accusers' names. At the same time, the issue of whether to shield victims of sex crimes from exposure has launched countless newsroom arguments. Is it fair to the alleged perpetrators to allow accusers to remain anonymous, especially in cases where the charge has turned out to be false? Is such a policy inadvertently perpetuating the notion that victims of sexual abuse have something to be ashamed about? The Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics does not include a blanket prohibition on using the names of sexual abuse victims; it merely advises news organizations to \\"be cautious\\" about identifying them. Kevin Z. Smith, SPJ's past president and chairman of its ethics committee, said it is his personal belief that media organizations should reconsider their stand against naming. \\"We shouldn't stigmatize victims of sexual assault,\\" he said. \\"I don't think as a society we do ourselves a favor by ostracizing these people, and I don't think the press does a helpful job by perpetuating that by saying, \`We are going to protect you.\\"' Even Giugliano, the social worker, said there can be a benefit to testifying in open court. Some victims find it liberating to confront their abuser, he said. \\"There can be a very positive effect through all of this, a release of shame, having their voice heard and their day in court, a feeling of being vindicated,\\" Giugliano said. \\"Those things can have a very positive, empowering effect.\\" But he said that decision should be left to the individual and his therapist.

Second question: What is the best Dr. Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: 1). no. 2). yes.","response":"To answer the first question, let's analyze the best Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4: 1. Understand Mario's strengths and weaknesses: Mario is a well-rounded character with no major weaknesses. He has good speed, decent power, and great combo potential. Be aware that his recovery is somewhat limited. 2. Utilize his fireball projectiles: Use Mario's fireball to pressure opponents from a distance and force them to approach or make mistakes. 3. Master Mario's combo game: Learn Mario's combo moves, such as his down throw to up tilt and up air strings. This will let you build damage quickly and maintain stage control. 4. Edgeguard with FLUDD and cape: Use Mario's FLUDD move to push opponents away from the stage, and his cape to turn them around and mess up their recovery attempts. 5. Utilize the Super Jump Punch for vertical recovery and kills: Mario's up special, the Super Jump Punch, can be used to recover back to the stage and can also finish opponents off at high percentages. Now let's analyze the best Dr. Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4: 1. Understand Dr. Mario's strengths and weaknesses: Dr. Mario is a slower, more powerful version of Mario. He deals more damage and has stronger knockback, but is slower and has a weaker recovery. 2. Utilize his faster, bouncier pills: Use Dr. Mario's pills to pressure opponents from a distance, as they are more difficult to predict and react to than Mario's fireballs. 3. Focus on powerful hit confirms: Dr. Mario has stronger smash attacks and aerials than Mario, so connecting with them is essential to securing kills. 4. Master Dr. Mario's Tornado as a recovery tool: His down special, Dr. Tornado, can help with recovery when used in conjunction with his double jump. 5. Punish opponents with his forward aerial: Dr. Mario's \\"Dr. Punch\\" is a powerful kill move that can take stocks early if used effectively. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Answer: 1). no. Although both questions ask about the best strategies for two characters in Super Smash Bros. 4, they are not asking the same thing.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The first step of the process in the context provided involves the functioning of the kidneys, which are essential organs in the human body responsible for filtering blood and removing waste products. This process maintains overall fluid and electrolyte balance, regulates blood pressure, and helps maintain proper pH levels in the body. The detailed first step of the process is described below: 1. Blood Supply and Filtration: The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery, which branches off from the aorta - the body's main artery supplying oxygen-rich blood from the heart. The renal artery further divides into arterioles and then into a network of tiny capillaries called glomeruli, which are surrounded by a complex of small tubules known as nephrons. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons that work together to filter waste and perform other crucial functions. In this initial step, filtration occurs when the blood flows through the glomerulus, a network of minuscule blood vessels with tiny pores. The pressure generated within these blood vessels pushes water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and other small molecules out of the blood and into the adjacent capsule called Bowman's capsule, which encapsulates the glomerulus. This process creates a filtrate that lacks large molecules and cells such as proteins, red and white blood cells, and platelets, which are too large to pass through the pores of the glomerulus. This filtration step marks the beginning of blood purification and waste removal within the nephrons. The resulting filtrate is then processed further along the nephrons through a series of reabsorption, secretion, and concentration processes to remove waste, return valuable substances to the body, and maintain optimal levels of electrolytes and water. The intricate functioning of nephrons and the entire renal system underscores the kidneys' essential and complex role in maintaining homeostasis and overall health."},{"question":"La police a tenté encore une fois de l’arrêter le 10 de ce mois.

The story revolves around the Grinch, a bitter, grouchy green creature living on Mount Crumpit, just north of the idyllic Whoville, home to the cheerful Whos. The Grinch loathes Christmas and plans to ruin the holiday for the Whos by stealing everything related to Christmas, including the presents, decorations, and food. The television special adds the iconic song \\"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch,\\" composed by Albert Hague and written by Dr. Seuss, which has become a well-known holiday tune over the years. Despite the Grinch's best efforts, the Whos' indomitable holiday spirit isn't dampened, leading the Grinch to have a change of heart and learn the true meaning of Christmas. The animated television special paved the way for other adaptations, including the 2000 live-action film titled \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\\" starring Jim Carrey as the Grinch, and the 2018 computer-animated movie titled \\"The Grinch,\\" with Benedict Cumberbatch voicing the titular character. However, the 1966 television special remains deeply ingrained in popular culture and is considered by many as the original Grinch who stole Christmas."},{"question":"Gas-powered generators have been providing power to major cities. A state of emergency has been declared. The pylons brought electricity from Ukraine. Engineers were reportedly denied access to the site by Ukrainian activists. Crimea was annexed by Russia last year, but the Ukrainian authorities have continued to supply power to the area. Images on social media show Ukrainian flags on some damaged pylons - and Crimean Tatar flags on others. Crimean authorities said they had managed to partially reconnect the cities of Simferopol, Yalta and Saky using generators. But more than 1.6 million people remain without power, and water supplies to high buildings have stopped and cable and mobile internet is down. Some 150 schools were also without power. \\"I had no electricity all night. These useless officials can't run the city and they still haven't built a local power station,\\" a resident of Sevastopol told AFP news agency. \\"It's not the first time Ukraine has cut off electricity to Crimea, we are already used to power cuts and stock up on batteries,\\" another one said. Mikhail Sheremet, Crimea's deputy prime minister, said the peninsula's hospitals had backup power sources and would not be affected. Two of the four main power lines were cut in an earlier attack on Friday, reports said. Ukrainian authorities said they encountered activists blockading the site when they tried to repair the damaged pylons. \\"The nature of the damage shows that it took place as a result of shelling or the use of explosive devices,\\" Ukraine's state energy company Ukrenergo said in a statement. Ukrenergo said it hoped to finish all repairs within four days. Crimean Tatars, an ethnic group native to the peninsula who oppose Russian rule, held a protest at the site of the broken power lines in Kherson region, Russia's RIA news agency reported.

It used to be part of a big country called Ukraine, but now it is part of an even bigger country called Russia. The people who lived in Crimea still get electricity from Ukraine, which makes their lights, computers, and TVs work. But one day, some people broke the tall towers, called pylons, that send the electricity to Crimea. Now lots of people in Crimea don't have any lights or power. Some people think the people who broke the pylons come from Ukraine, and they did it because they are angry that Crimea joined Russia. The big bosses are trying to fix everything, but it is taking a long time, and people in Crimea are not happy. Some even have to use special machines called generators to get a little bit of power.

In 1880, his son John Church Hamilton commissioned Carl Conrads to sculpt a granite statue, now located in Central Park, New York City. One statue honoring Alexander Hamilton in Chicago was mired in controversy, at least concerning the surrounding architecture. Kate Sturges Buckingham (1858-1937), of the Buckingham Fountain family, commissioned the monument. Its impetus was that Treasury Secretary Hamilton \\"secured the nation's financial future and made it possible for her own family to make its fortune in grain elevators and banking. Consequently, John Angel was hired to model a figurative sculpture and the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen was to create a \\"colossal architectural setting\\" for it. The proposed 80-foot tall columned shelter was poorly received. By Ms. Buckingham's death in 1937, the sculpture's setting. location and design were uncertain. Conspiracy allegations surfaced, and the matter became mired in litigation. After the courts ordered the construction to be completed by 1953, the trustees hired architect Samuel A. Marx. The structure was completed, had structural problems, and was eventually demolished in 1993. The statue was gilded, and is still on display. A statue, by James Earle Fraser, was dedicated on May 17, 1923, on the south terrace of the Treasury Building, in Washington. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"For how many years did Ms. Buckinghams statue of Alexander Hamilton stand?\\" is \\"40\\"?","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it cannot be accurately determined how many years Ms. Buckingham's statue of Alexander Hamilton stood, as there is no specific information about when the statue was actually erected.

The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose tea again.

Question: What trade did the ancient Somalis and others compete for?","response":"The ancient Somalis and other civilizations, such as the Sabaeans, Parthians, and Axumites, competed for the wealthy Indo-Greco-Roman trade that thrived during the classical era. This period of rich international exchange, which roughly spanned from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD, saw major powers and city-states establish a network of trade routes, connecting the Hellenistic, Indian, and Roman worlds. The Indo-Greco-Roman trade primarily involved the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices between the Indian subcontinent, the Hellenistic world (encompassing Greece, Egypt, and the Near East), and the Roman Empire. These connections were facilitated through both land routes, such as the famous Silk Road, and maritime routes across the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean. Various items were traded across these routes, including luxurious and exotic products that were highly sought after by the elite of different societies. Among the items exchanged were: 1. Spices: A variety of spices from India, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom, were in great demand in the classical world, particularly in Rome where they were used in food, medicine, and religious rituals. 2. Textiles: Silk from China, cotton from India, and linens from Egypt were popular commodities for their comfort, durability, and symbolic value. Richly embroidered fabrics and clothing from the East were highly prized by nobles in the Hellenistic and Roman worlds. 3. Metals and precious stones: Gold, silver, and precious stones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds from India and the East Africa's Red Sea coast were highly valued for their beauty and rarity. They were used for making jewelry, coins, and other luxury items. 4. Art and artifacts: Classical Greek and Roman statues, pottery, and other artworks were sought by the elites in the eastern parts of the trade network. In return, Indian and African art, including carved ivory, textiles, and pottery, were desired by the Western cultures. 5. Knowledge and ideas: This trade network was not only focused on the exchange of material goods but also ideas, philosophies, and scientific knowledge. Concepts from Greek and Roman philosophy, mathematics, astrology, and medicine made their way into India and vice versa, enriching these realms with diverse and evolving intellectual traditions. Ancient Somalis and other city-states situated near Cape Guardafui, such as Opone, Essina, Sarapion, Nikon, Malao, Damo, and Mosylon, played a significant role in facilitating this trade, as they provided invaluable access to maritime routes through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Moreover, they acted as intermediaries for the exchange of goods, culture, and knowledge, positioning them as central players in the vibrant, interconnected world of the classical era. In summary, the ancient Somalis and their neighbors competed for the wealthy Indo-Greco-Roman trade, which comprised a vast network of exchanges involving a wide range of goods, ideas, and cultural practices among the Hellenistic, Indian, and Roman worlds. These interactions over land and sea routes significantly shaped the economic, cultural, and intellectual landscape of the classical era."},{"question":"Information: - Ubisoft Entertainment SA (formerly Ubi Soft Entertainment Software until 2003, commonly referred to as Ubisoft) is a French multinational video game publisher, headquartered in Rennes, France.

In the first quarter, the Niners started off bumpy as Seahawks RB Shaun Alexander got a 3-yard TD run for Seattle's early strike and the only score of the period. In the second quarter, San Francisco would get a field goal before halftime as kicker Joe Nedney nailed one from 39 yards out. After a scorless third quarter, the Niners were in full force as QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to rookie TE Vernon Davis. Afterwards, Smith would complete a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore. Then, the 49ers wrapped the game up with Smith getting a very easy 18-yard QB sneak for a touchdown. Seattle would get one more score as QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 22-yard TD pass to TE Jerramy Stevens. Fortunately, the Niners would get the win and the season sweep over the Seahawks. With the win, the 49ers improved to 6-8 Ask a question about this article.","response":"What were the key plays and turning points that led to the 49ers' victory and season sweep over the Seahawks?"},{"question":"Question: Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"We can hang our wet clothes in the bedroom.\\" - Sentence B: \\"We can hang our wet clothes on the balcony.\\" Please answer this question gradually:","response":"To answer your question, I will take the following steps: 1- Analyzing the meaning of each sentence. 2- Evaluating the logic found in these sentences. 1. Analyzing the meaning of each sentence: - Sentence A: \\"We can hang our wet clothes in the bedroom.\\" This sentence conveys the idea of hanging wet clothes inside a bedroom, possibly on a drying rack, clothesline, or another suitable rod or hook. - Sentence B: \\"We can hang our wet clothes on the balcony.\\" This sentence suggests hanging wet clothes outside on the balcony, likely using a clothesline, drying rack, or a similar setup. This is a common practice in many countries, especially in urban areas or places with limited space for drying clothes. 2. Evaluating the logic found in these sentences: Both sentences are grammatically correct and coherent; however, it is worth evaluating the logic behind each statement. Sentence A: While it is technically possible to hang wet clothes in the bedroom, it might not be the most effective method for drying clothes. Damp clothes would increase the humidity level in the room, which may lead to discomfort, stale air, or even mold growth. Additionally, there may not be enough airflow to dry the clothes quickly and efficiently. Sentence B: Hanging wet clothes on the balcony is a suitable option for drying clothes. It is a common practice as it provides exposure to sunlight, better air circulation, and a designated place for drying. This method is both practical and logical. Conclusion: Both sentences make sense grammatically, but Sentence A is somewhat illogical due to the potential negative effects of hanging wet clothes in a bedroom. In contrast, Sentence B is more practical and makes logical sense, considering that hanging wet clothes on a balcony allows for effective drying. However, the question does not ask for the most practical or logical option, but instead for the one that \\"doesn't make sense.\\" In this context, both sentences meet the basic criteria for making sense, even if Sentence A isn't ideal in terms of practicality."},{"question":"Please answer this question: Frdric Chopin is best known for his compositions for which instrument?","response":"Frederic Chopin is best known for his compositions for the piano.

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested.

The basketball team at Idaho State University 2014 -- 15 men represented Idaho State Bengals during the 2014 Basketball season -- 15 NCAA Division I mens .","response":"Yes, the two sentences essentially have the same meaning. However, there are slight differences in the arrangement of words, the use of prepositions, and the entities they employ to refer to the same subject. 1. \\"The basketball team of Idaho State Bengal - Men 2014 -- 15 represented Idaho State University during the 2014 Basketball season -- 15 NCAA Division I men.\\" In this sentence, \\"The basketball team of Idaho State Bengal - Men 2014 -- 15\\" is the subject. It's slightly awkwardly worded, but it seems to refer to the men's basketball team for Idaho State University, known as the Idaho State Bengals, that competed in the 2014-15 season. This team is said to \\"represent Idaho State University during the 2014 Basketball season -- 15 NCAA Division I men.\\" So, the sentence suggests that in the 2014-2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, this team was acting as Idaho State University's representative or participant. 2. \\"The basketball team at Idaho State University 2014 -- 15 men represented Idaho State Bengals during the 2014 Basketball season -- 15 NCAA Division I mens.\\" This sentence is similarly structured but with a twist. Here, the subject is \\"The basketball team at Idaho State University 2014 -- 15 men\\", which seems to reference the same entity as the first sentence: the 2014-15 men's basketball team of Idaho State University. However, the team is said to \\"represent Idaho State Bengals during the 2014 Basketball season -- 15 NCAA Division I mens.\\" This is a bit grammatically incorrect because the Idaho State Bengals is the name of the sports teams of Idaho State University, so saying the university's basketball team represented the Bengals is like saying it represented itself. To be correct, it should say the team represented Idaho State University. In summary, both sentences describe the same scenario: The Idaho State University's men's basketball team (also known as the Idaho State Bengals) played in the 2014-2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. However, the syntax, the accuracy of the sentences and their grammatically correctness, and their fluidity vary between the two sentences."},{"question":"Use this fact to answer the question: pollution is a source of pollutants Pollution is a source of what?

The move comes in the wake of several high-profile cyber attacks originating in China which targeted U.S and other government officials. China is widely suspected of being. the origin of many hacking attacks on government and commercial websites. abroad, but officials have repeatedly dismissed reports that the. government or military could be behind such attacks. Earlier this year, hackers based in Jinan, China targeted personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts of government officials. The methods used suggested insider knowledge about the offiicals according to many observers. The Chinese government denied any involvement. 'Blaming these misdeeds on China is unacceptable,' said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei after the attacks. 'Hacking is an international problem and China is also a victim. The claims of so-called support for hacking are completely unfounded.' China bans numerous overseas. websites, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and some foreign media. outlets, fearing the uncensored sharing of images and information could. cause social instability and harm national. security. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said on Friday it would work with 10 Chinese search engines to protect the website rankings of financial institutions to lessen the chances that Internet users will be duped by phishing websites. A phishing attack occurs when the user is persuaded to part with his or her username and password via a fake webpage that closely resembles the original. Through the collaboration, the official websites of several Chinese banks, such as Agricultural Bank of China and China Construction Bank will be ranked first in the search engine when a user searches for the related keywords, the Ministry said in an online circular on Friday. The move comes after a spate of personal data leaks that alarmed the online community and prompted calls for tougher scrutiny of who has access to online information. China claims the most Internet users in the world at 485 million, state media reported last month, and despite widespread censorship and monitoring online, many users have been up in arms about the reported data leaks and their implications. The user IDs, passwords and e-mail addresses of more than 6 million accounts registered on CSDN - a site for programmers - were leaked, Xinhua New Agency reported last week, citing an anti-virus software provider which discovered the problem. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it would investigate the hacking incidents, 'The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of Internet users and threatens Internet safety. The department strongly condemns such behaviour.' What are the important parts of this article?","response":"This article primarily discusses the Chinese government's efforts to enhance internet security for its citizens after a series of personal data leaks from social networking sites and phishing attacks on bank accounts. Some key points from the article include: 1. The Chinese government is collaborating with 10 Chinese search engines, which already censor the internet under Chinese law, to ensure that fake banks appear lower in search rankings. This move is aimed at protecting Chinese citizens from falling victim to phishing attacks through fake websites resembling original financial institutions. 2. Despite China being suspected as the origin of numerous hacking attacks on government and commercial websites abroad, Chinese officials have repeatedly denied any involvement. They claim that hacking is an international problem and China is also a victim. 3. The article mentions that earlier this year, hackers based in Jinan, China targeted personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts of government officials, suggesting insider knowledge. However, the Chinese government denied any involvement in this. 4. China has a strict censorship policy for the internet, banning numerous overseas websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube due to concerns that uncensored sharing of images and information could lead to social instability and harm national security. 5.

In the first statement, \\"A snowboarder soars off a jump upside down at the mountain resort's terrain park,\\" we can infer that the snowboarder is actively participating in snowboarding activities at the terrain park, specifically performing a trick or maneuver that involves being upside down in the air. This implies that the snowboarder is not only awake but is also physically engaged in the activity. The second statement, \\"The snowboarder is sleeping,\\" contradicts the first statement as it suggests that the snowboarder is inactive and not engaged in any physical activity. Sleep is a state of rest and recovery, where the individual is usually unconscious and non-responsive to stimuli. This is the opposite of the action being described in the first statement. There is no logical connection between these two statements. It is possible for a snowboarder to sleep at some point in time when not engaged in snowboarding activities, but it doesn't follow simply because they are soaring off a jump upside down in the terrain park. The two conditions – performing a snowboarding trick and sleeping – are mutually exclusive and cannot be present simultaneously. Thus, it does not logically follow that the snowboarder is sleeping just because they are performing a snowboarding trick at the mountain resort's terrain park."},{"question":"Question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"I hate it when companies like these force users to download applications like google play that deemed unnecessary and pain for the users.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

A:","response":"Title: The Whimsical Windmill Genre: Adventure, Comedy, Family Act I: Set in the quaint little town of Windshire, the story begins with Mr. Jones, a kind-hearted and eccentric inventor, beloved by all the town's people. He lives on the outskirts of Windshire in a charming, old windmill that he has converted into his home and workshop. Mr. Jones has dedicated his life to creating unique and outlandish inventions that would make the people of Windshire's lives easier and more enjoyable. However, many of his inventions either malfunction or have unexpected consequences. The town of Windshire, though picturesque and warm, faces a problem that affects everyone - frequent power outages due to its aging power grid. The mayor, a stern and pragmatic woman named Mrs. Brown, announces a town-wide competition for a renewable energy solution. Mr. Jones, excited at the prospect of helping his fellow townspeople, decides to create a one-of-a-kind invention to harness the power of his windmill and generate electricity for the entire town. Act II: Needing assistance in the development of his invention, Mr. Jones enlists the help of Lucy Wells, a bright young engineer who recently returned to Windshire after completing her studies. Together, they work tirelessly to create an energy device that will revolutionize the town's power supply. As they grow closer, Mr. Jones shares his fascinating stories about his previous gadgets and adventures while Lucy grows fond of Mr. Jones's unique and quirky personality. Driven by their shared passion for innovation, they create an invention that uses a series of mirrors and lenses to harness the power of the windmill and the sun to generate electricity. One fateful day, Mr. Jones and Lucy decide to test their invention. The townspeople gather around the windmill, anxiously waiting to see if their power problems will finally be resolved. As Mr. Jones flips the switch to activate the device, an unforeseen mishap occurs - a sudden downpour creates a slippery patch of mud near the windmill. Act III: While trying to adjust the machine's settings, Mr. Jones slips and accidentally fires a focused beam of solar energy at the windmill, causing it to explode in a burst of colors and a whirlwind of confetti. The unforeseen explosion is a result of Mr. Jones's earlier experiment with non-lethal fireworks. Though initially disappointed and embarrassed by the unexpected outcome, the townspeople begin to laugh and celebrate the whimsical explosion. At the same time, the force of the explosion inadvertently flips the switch on another one of Mr. Jones's inventions - a backup power generator that utilizes a new energy source discovered during their work on the windmill project. The generator starts working flawlessly, and Windshire's power problems are solved at last. The people of Windshire applaud Mr. Jones and Lucy for their dedication and congratulate them on their success. Mrs. Brown, moved by the incident and the genuine happiness of the townspeople, realizes the importance of Mr. Jones's creative spirit and the unity of the community fostered by his brilliant mind. As the movie ends, Mr. Jones and Lucy begin work on their next big invention for the town, hand in hand, with the support and love of the people of Windshire. The once-doomed windmill becomes a symbol of hope, ingenuity, and the power of unconventional thinking."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Article: A deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year.

The cheeseburger is cold, and the fries are too salty, like someone dumped a whole bottle of salt on them. And the milkshake?

Schlessinger has said her father was charming and her mother beautiful as a young woman. Schlessinger met and married Michael F. Rudolph, a dentist, in 1972 while she was attending Columbia University. The couple had a Unitarian ceremony. Separating from Rudolph, Schlessinger moved to Encino, California in 1975 when she obtained a job in the science department at the University of Southern California. Their divorce was finalized in 1977. In 1975, while working in the labs at USC, she met Lewis G. Bishop, a professor of neurophysiology who was married and the father of three children. Bishop separated from his wife and began living with Schlessinger the same year. Speaking as one who went through and has personal experience with the social problems associated with such lifestyle choices, Schlessinger has vociferously proclaimed her disapproval of unwed couples \\"shacking up\\" and having children out of wedlock, helping others to not make the bad choices in the first place. According to her friend Shelly Herman, \\"Laura lived with Lew for about nine years before she was married to him.\\" \\"His divorce was final in 1979. Bishop and Schlessinger married in 1985.

Since 112 is not greater than 125, she is not eligible for the 25. Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Kathleen has left.

Zero-hours contracts do not guarantee a minimum number of hours of employment. The ONS recently estimated that 583,000 people, around 2% of the UK workforce, were employed on zero-hours contracts between October and December 2013. It said the data suggested that most workers on such contracts had at least two jobs. What are zero-hours contracts? Last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable ruled out a complete ban on the contracts, because they offer employers \\"welcome flexibility\\". Following the release of the ONS figures Mr Cable said it was also clear there had been some abuse of those on zero hour contracts by some less scrupulous employers. \\"Given the current estimates of people on these types of contracts, it is important we take action. That is why I launched a consultation on the issue of exclusivity in zero hours to ensure people are getting a fair deal,\\" he said. \\"Students, older people and people wanting to top up their income want to work flexibly, but we want to make sure they understand their rights and that they are not tied exclusively to one employer. \\"We will be publishing the results of this consultation shortly.\\" Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband said zero hours contracts had \\"spread like an epidemic\\" as he promised to crack down on them if his party wins the 2015 general election. The study found that more than 20% of health and social workers are employed on a zero-hours contacts. But zero-hours contracts are rare in financial services, the ONS found. People with zero-hours contracts were disproportionately students, female and under 25 or over 65, the study also found. \\"These patterns may partly reflect the groups most likely to find the flexibility of 'zero-hours contracts' an advantage,\\" the ONS said. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the figures showed the UK jobs market was far more unstable than the government suggested, and urged ministers to crack down on the \\"abuse\\" of zero-hours contracts by employers. \\"Insecure work with no guarantee of regular paid hours is no longer confined to the fringes of the jobs market,\\" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary. \\"It is worrying that so many young people are trapped on zero-hours contracts, which can hold back their careers and make it harder to pay off debts like student loans. \\"The fact that these contracts have become the norm in tourism, catering and food will be a major concern for the millions of people employed in these industries.\\" ONS said it found evidence of a further 1.3 million contracts where no work was undertaken. It said the total might include: It added some of contracts \\"probably\\" needed to be added to the official 1.4 million estimate, but that it wanted to investigate in more detail. The ONS said it would carry out further research and report later in 2014. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, Britain's main human resources body, estimated last year that employers used about one million zero-hours contracts. Summary:","response":"Zero-hours contracts, which offer employers flexibility but do not guarantee a minimum number of hours for workers, are used by 2% of the UK workforce, with health and social workers being the most impacted and people under 25 or over 65 being disproportionately affected."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: Where does Natalie unexpectedly return from?

Far to the south, Grand Canyon National Park officials are trying to better manage bison on the park's North Rim. Actually, they're trying to get the animals off the park's property on the North Rim. The root of the problem dates back more than a century, to 1906, when a rancher by the name of Charles “Buffalo” Jones bought some bison to breed with his cows with hopes of producing \\"a superior, more robust breed of livestock, the 'cattalo.'\\" Unfortunately for Buffalo Jones, the experiment was a failure. But not all the resulting \\"cattaloes\\" were removed from the federal lands on the Kaibab Plateau. Today, the descendants of this hybrid group are managed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department as wild game, with a limited hunting season each year. Unfortunately for the Park Service, since 2000 these hybrid bison have moved from the U.S. Forest Service lands up onto the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. \\"The herd now numbers more than 400 head, with the majority staying within park boundaries year round,\\" park officials note. \\"Unfortunately these extremely large grazing animals are fouling sensitive and critical water sources, trampling and removing delicate vegetation, and compacting fragile soils.\\" During a teleconference Wednesday with reporters, Grand Canyon Superintendent Dave Uberuaga said the cow-bison hybrids have caused grazing problems on the park's North Rim, impacts to lakeshores, and \\"there's been some archaeological impacts as well.\\" With hopes of reaching a solution to this problem, Grand Canyon officials are initiating a public scoping period for a bison management plan. Possible solutions range from fencing out the animals to culling, as is done in parks with elk population problems, such as Rocky Mountain National Park. Genetically, these animals are nothing special, according to a list of \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" the Park Service prepared. While officials on the conference call Wednesday couldn't break down, percentage-wise, the genetic makeup of these hybrids, the FAQ sheet noted that, \\"Recent genetic testing indicates the current population continues to have historic cattle genetics, though no outward physical characteristics of cattle have been observed in over 20 years. Genetic science also indicates that these bison do not possess the highly diverse or unique genetics for furthering the conservation of the species, compared to other wild bison herds.\\" Still, there are proponents for allowing the animals to remain on the North Rim inside the park. \\"Cattle genes are now ubiquitous in North American bison: small amounts of cattle genes are found in the majority of national, state and private bison herds in the United States. While some of those bison are domesticated, others are wild despite gene contamination,\\" reads an op-ed piece that ran in the Arizona Daily Sun. \\"The Grand Canyon herd should be genetically tested, and their behavior studied. Individuals of the Grand Canyon herd with excessive gene contamination or strong domestic behavior could be eliminated. Doing so would present a rare opportunity for Grand Canyon National Park to contribute to the genetic heritage of the America bison.\\" Nevertheless, Superintendent Uberuaga said the Park Service would like to see an agreement \\"to move them off park lands, onto Forest Service lands where they would be able to be huntable wildlife.\\" The first opportunity to begin to craft such a management plan will be during a 60-day public scoping period beginning when the Notice of Intent is published in the Federal Register. Scoping will provide the public and other interested parties the opportunity to participate early in identifying the range of issues to be considered when the NPS studies the potential environmental impacts of managing bison in the park; to identify topics and concerns that should be addressed in the EIS; and to bring forward any new information that NPS may not be aware of that would be useful in preparing the plan and EIS. The Park Service also will host three in-person open house meetings during this comment period, as follows: Monday, April 28 Kanab Middle School 690 S. Cowboy Way Kanab, UT 84741 6 p.m.-8 p.m. Tuesday, April 29 High Country Conference Center 201 W.

(Associated Press) This undated photo provided by Arizona Game and Fish Department shows Bison roaming along the northern reaches of the Grand Canyon. The bison were introduced to the area in 1906 as part of a ranching... (Associated Press) FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — The herds of bison roaming the northern reaches of the Grand Canyon are causing headaches for park staff as the animals graze in pristine meadows, trample vegetation, damage cliff dwellings and pollute water sources. The bison were introduced to northern Arizona in the early 1900s as part of a ranching operation to crossbreed them with cattle, creating hybrids known as beefalo or cattalo. The state of Arizona owns and maintains the bison outside the national park, but the animals now are making their home almost exclusively within the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. Federal and state officials are looking at methods to manage the estimated 350-450 bison in a way that rids them from the park and allows for a free-ranging population that can be hunted on nearby forest land. On Wednesday, they announced a trio of public meetings to be held in southern Utah and Arizona and a 60-day scoping period. \\"It's the first step in a long process today,\\" Grand Canyon Superintendent Dave Uberuaga said. \\"We're just trying to get it out there and get it on everybody's radar screens.\\" The bison no longer look like cattle but still have about 10 percent cattle in their genes. The massive animals have reduced vegetation in meadows to nubs, traveled into Mexican spotted owl habitat, knocked over walls at American Indian cliff dwellings below the North Rim, defecated in lakes and left ruts in wetlands, Uberuaga said. The iconic symbols of the West can weigh more than 2,000 pounds and run three times faster than humans, the agency has said. While the Arizona Game and Fish Department was able to keep the number of bison around 100, their move to the Grand Canyon means that fewer are hunted because it is outlawed at the national park, said Carl Lutch, wildlife program manager for the department. Permits to hunt bison range from about 360 for a yearling to nearly 1,100 for a bull bison for Arizona residents. Twenty permits were issued for the spring season that runs from January to June 15. Management methods likely to be brought up during the public scoping period that ends June 6 include baiting, hazing, fencing, relocating the bison and shooting them. Uberuaga said birth control hasn't proven an effective method for controlling the population. Public meetings are scheduled for April 28 in Kanab, Utah; April 29 in Flagstaff; and April 30 in Phoenix. A couple of online meetings also are planned. The animals can be seen as visitors drive up to the entrance to the Grand Canyon's North Rim, but they don't stick around long. Unlike bison herds at Yellowstone National Park, Uberuaga said the northern Arizona bison are afraid of the public because of the pressure from hunting and quickly run off into the woods. Officials at Yellowstone, too, are considering an update to their bison management plan. The herds have lived in Yellowstone continuously since prehistoric times, but park officials have concerns over transmission of disease to livestock in Montana. Arizona became the owner of the hybrid bison in the northern part of the state after a rancher's experiment to produce a robust type of livestock by breeding cattle with bison largely failed. The offspring of the animals that the state purchased from a cattle rancher in 1926 began walking up the Kaibab Plateau in the late 1990s and into the national park, seeking better forage. Officials from the National Park Service, Arizona Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service began meeting in recent years on ways to manage the bison. A plan is expected to be issued in the fall of 2016. ||||| Summary:","response":"Grand Canyon National Park faces issues with managing bison on the park's North Rim.

Options: - steal - purchase food from webvan.com - eat - work for - grow food. Explanation:","response":"Grow food is the correct answer to the question because it is generally the most cost-effective and sustainable method of obtaining food for oneself. Here's a simple explanation of why the other options are less ideal: 1. Steal: Stealing food is illegal and unethical. It can lead to criminal charges and harm relationships with others, ultimately costing more in the long run due to potential fines or imprisonment. 2. Purchase food from webvan.com: Purchasing food online, including from webvan.com, may be convenient, but it often comes with a higher price tag than growing your own food. This is due to costs associated with packaging, transportation, and other overhead expenses. 3. Eat: The option \\"eat\\" isn't a viable method for obtaining food, as it simply describes the act of consuming food that must first be obtained through other means. 4. Work for: Working for food, or participating in a barter system with an employer, involves trading your time and labor for the opportunity to have food. This option can have an opportunity cost, as the value of your time might be worth more than the food you receive in exchange for your work. 5. Grow food: Growing your own food is an efficient way of obtaining it at a low cost, especially if you have access to a suitable plot of land. By growing your own fruits, vegetables, and possibly raising livestock (if feasible), you can save money on groceries, control the quality of the food you consume, and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. In conclusion, out of the options presented, growing your own food is the cheapest way to obtain it, as it enables you to reduce expenses and enjoy a more sustainable and self-sufficient way of life."},{"question":"Choose how you want this story to end.

Article: What if handheld tools know what needs to be done and were even able to guide and help inexperienced users to complete jobs that require skill? Researchers at the University of Bristol have developed and started studying a novel concept in robotics--intelligent handheld robots. Historically, handheld tools have been straight, unintelligent instruments that are _ of the context they operate in, are fully directed by the user, and therefore, lack any understanding about the task they are performing. Dr. Walterio Mayol-Cuevas and PhD student, Austin Gregg-Smith, from the University's Department of Computer Science, have been working in the design of the robot as well as in understanding how best to be with a tool that \\"knows and acts\\". Compared to other tools such as power tools that have a motor and perhaps some basic sensors , the handheld robots developed at Bristol are designed to have more degrees of freedom to allow greater independence from the instructions of the user, and importantly, understand the steps being carried out. This allows for a new level of co-operation between user and tool, such as the user providing directions and the tool performing the detailed task. Handheld robots, aim to share physical similarity with users but are neither fully independent as is a humanoid robot nor are part of the user's body. The aim with handheld robots is to develop the intuitiveness of using traditional handheld tools while adding planted intelligence and action to allow for new abilities. Dr. Mayol-Cuevas, Reader in Robotics Computer Vision and Mobile Systems, said, \\"There are three basic levels of autonomy we are considering: no autonomy, semi-autonomous when the robot advises the user but does not act, and fully autonomous when the robot advises and acts even by correcting or refusing to perform incorrect user actions.\\" Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: The handheld robots can never disobey the user's order. B: The autonomy is the only thing that the scientists are considering. C: There will be more intelligence and independence in the handheld robots. D: The aim of the handheld robots is to correct and refuse the user's directions.","response":"First, let's break down the options and compare them with the relevant information in the article. Option A: The handheld robots can never disobey the user's order. - The article mentions that fully autonomous robots will advise and act, and even correct or refuse incorrect user actions. This implies that handheld robots can indeed disobey the user's order in some cases. Option B: The autonomy is the only thing that the scientists are considering. - Autonomy is an important aspect mentioned in the article, but it also discusses the design of the robot, the degree of freedom, and cooperation between user and tool. Option C: There will be more intelligence and independence in the handheld robots. - The article mentions that handheld robots are designed to have more degrees of freedom, and they will understand the steps of a task. This supports the statement that there will be more intelligence and independence in the handheld robots. Option D: The aim of the handheld robots is to correct and refuse the user's directions. - While one of the levels of autonomy does involve correcting or refusing incorrect user actions, it is not the primary aim of the handheld robots. The article states that the aim is to develop intuitiveness, combine traditional handheld tools with intelligence, and enable new abilities.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"Your question seems to suggest an involvement in the process of oil formation, which is a result of plants and animals dying, eventually becoming buried under layer upon layer of soil, and the intense pressure and heat over the course of millions of years causing these remains to become transformed into oil. The process is a direct result of the death of organisms, gradual burial, pressure build-up, liquefaction, and carbon atoms rearranging to form oil. A direct increase in the deaths of plants and animals potentially means that there will be more raw materials available for oil formation. Now, if the number of plant and animal deaths increased, this would be a direct impact on the first step in the oil making process. The more plants and animals that die, the more organic material there is to eventually transform into oil, considering other conditions necessary for oil formation remain constant. This, however, is contingent on the assumption that these increased deaths occur in regions where organic material has the chance to be trapped and preserved in the manner needed for oil formation, that is, get buried under layers of soil and sediment before they are decomposed, and subjected to the right amounts of pressure and heat to trigger the transformation process. The key to oil formation isn't purely about how many plants and animals die, but also about the specific conditions that are required for their transformation into oil. Notably, it involves particular environmental conditions, a certain sequence of geological events, and occurs over an immensely long timescale—a process that started millions of years ago is still ongoing today. Given that the question asks for a \\"supposed perturbation\\", it's reasonable to consider the increase in plant and animal deaths as directly impacting the first step of the oil-making process. However, such a change would not simply equate to more oil production because there are several other factors involved in this complex, lengthy geological process ranging from the burial and preservation of these organic materials, to the type of sediment, to the precise temperature and pressure conditions required. So, a direct increase in the quantity of dying organic material could potentially influence the oil making process, but this would not automatically translate into an increase in oil. Thus, it would be a kind of perturbation that directly impacts a step of the process, particularly the introduction of more organic material needed for the formation of oil, but indirectly impacts the overall output of oil due to the complexity of the conditions required."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: We...

The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"To determine if these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, we need to examine their meanings and compare them to see if they convey the same information. Sentence 1: In July 1962, the 4364th squadron of support was activated at Mountain Home and allocated to the division, but assigned to the 9th wing. Sentence 2: In July 1962, the 4364th Support Squadron was activated at Mountain Home and assigned to the division, but attached to the 9th wing. Step 1: Identify the main subjects and actions in both sentences - Both sentences mention the 4364th Support Squadron (or squadron of support) and the events that took place in July 1962 at Mountain Home. - Both sentences describe the squadron being activated, associated with the division, and having a relationship with the 9th wing. Step 2: Compare the similarities and differences between the two sentences - Both sentences agree on the activation, location, and time of the 4364th Support Squadron. - Sentence 1 uses the terms \\"allocated to the division\\" and \\"assigned to the 9th wing,\\" while sentence 2 uses \\"assigned to the division\\" and \\"attached to the 9th wing.\\" Step 3: Determine if the differences significantly change the meaning of the sentences - The difference in phrasing between \\"allocated\\" and \\"assigned\\" does not significantly change the meaning, as both indicate a relationship between the squadron and the division. - The difference between \\"assigned\\" and \\"attached\\" when describing the relationship between the squadron and the 9th wing is subtle. \\"Assigned\\" suggests a more formal and direct relationship, while \\"attached\\" might imply a temporary or less formal relationship. Conclusion: The two sentences are largely paraphrases of each other, as they convey very similar information about the activation of the 4364th Support Squadron, its relationship with the division, and its association with the 9th wing. The difference between \\"assigned\\" and \\"attached\\" is a minor nuance that does not significantly change the overall meaning of the sentences."},{"question":"Question: Given the following context: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Why is the sun too hot to run through and survive? Answer: The sun is too hot to run through and survive due to its intense heat, extremely high temperature, and its composition of nuclear fusion reactions that take place at its core. The sun is essentially a massive, continuously burning ball of gas and plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. At the core of the sun, temperatures reach approximately 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit). Here, nuclear fusion transforms hydrogen into helium through a series of reactions, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This energy radiates outward through the sun's layers and eventually reaches the Earth as sunlight. Even if you were to avoid running through the core, the sun's surface, called the photosphere, would still have temperatures around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit). These extreme temperatures would incinerate any living organism or known material, making it impossible for anyone or anything to run through and survive. Additionally, the sun's gravity is about 28 times stronger than Earth's. At this gravity level, any object would be crushed even before reaching the sun's surface, making survival even more unattainable. In summary, the sun is too hot to run through and survive due to its extreme temperatures, the ongoing nuclear fusion reactions, and its intense gravitational force. Running through the sun would result in immediate incineration and destruction of any living organism or material."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: The Huntsman for the following movie plot: Snow White (Kristen Stewart) is the princess of Tabor, daughter of King Magnus (Noah Huntley) and Queen Eleanor (Liberty Ross).

The opening is great, though, and shows Janine Reynaud performing an SM act on stage. It's all downhill from here, unfortunately.

Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez, who held a press conference outside the hospital, said the shooting happened at the Annie Coleman apartment complex near NW 60th Street and 20th Avenue at around 10 p.m. “Today we had a very scary incident. Obviously, we have two of our officers that work in the homicide task force, part of the gang unit, conducting an investigation near the Annie Coleman apartments,” he said. “The end result of their operation was that they were apparently shot in an ambush-style attack.” Police said two men ambushed the officers unprovoked. It’s unknown if shooters had any idea they targets were cops. One of the officers returned fire. It’s not known if a suspect was hit or not. A witness said she was on the phone with her boyfriend, who lives in the neighborhood, when she heard over two dozen shots. Police from multiple agencies set up a very large perimeter, extending as far as NW 56th Street. CBS4’s Silva Harapetian noted there were several helicopters in the air assisting in the search and saw SWAT passing through the area. Fire rescue from Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami were on the scene as well. Miami Fire Rescue told CBS4’s Oralia Ortega they were there in case anyone was injured during the search. Ortega was told by police that they do not have anyone in custody at this time. Authorities have not said how many people they are looking for at this time. Detectives did say one suspect is a black male between 17 or 18 years old. The officers were rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in the back of a pick-up truck. CBS4’s Hank Tester was able to confirm the two officers are in stable condition. Perez was joined by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez at the press conference outside the hospital. “As the director said, this was a brazen act of violence committed against two of our finest officers. They’re there trying to protect us and this community, and they were ambushed and we’re not gonna tolerate it,” said Gimenez. Both Perez and Gimenez asked that the community step forward and provide all they information they have to help find those responsible. “We need you now to step up to the plate. And if you know something, if you saw something, say something,” Perez said. “These people, if they are willing to do that to our own officers, are causing havoc in our community, causing chaos in people’s live, putting people below the ground. That’s what these guys are, murders in our community. So let’s work together to find a resolution to what occurred tonight.” Gimenez added, “You can tell by their tone and also the look on their faces that we are all united.” If you have any information that can help police, please contact Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.

The officers, who are members of a violent crime task force, were ambushed at about 10 p.m. while they were conducting surveillance at an apartment complex in the 1900 block of Northwest 59th Street as part of a multi-agency operation on gang activity, Maj. Hector Llevat said. \\"One of the officers was able to return fire,\\" Llevat said. \\"Individuals like this that have the audacity to ambush a vehicle unprovoked and open fire like that are individuals in this community that are causing havoc and terrorizing this community day in and day out.

They were identified Tuesday as Terence White and Charles Woods. White is a 26-year veteran of the Miami-Dade Police Department, while Woods is an 11-year veteran. \\"We do whatever we have to do to save our officers,\\" Perez said. \\"We got lucky tonight that the officers will survive. It's not going to deter us. In fact, what this does is the opposite.

Miami-Dade Police The officers, who are assigned to the Homicide Street Violence Task Force, were inside an unmarked vehicle in the parking lot of the complex at 1937 NW 60 Street around 10 p.m. Monday when they came under fire. “They were conducting surveillance for gang activity when they were ambushed in their vehicle. Two subjects opened fire on the officers and they ended up being injured. One of the officers was able to return fire,” said police Major Hector Llevat. One detective was shot in the leg, the other in the arm. An arriving officer rushed the two detectives to the Jackson Ryder Trauma Center in the back of a black pickup truck. On Tuesday morning, one of the detectives was listed in stable condition. The other was treated and released, police said. “They are lucky to be alive. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a car hit by so many rounds. A high powered weapon struck that vehicle and the officers should be counting their blessings today. We certainly are counting our blessings. Hopefully, the community will come through for us and whoever has information on the perpetrators responsible for the vicious attack on our officers, in this ambush type attack, will come forward,” said Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez.

The reason for this uncertainty lies in the lack of adequate context and information to determine the relationship between the individuals involved and the nature of the defiance. The statement \\"You defy me?\\" implies that someone is challenging authority, potentially breaking rules or expectations set by the person asking the question. However, this premise does not provide any insight into whether the person defying has any obligation to obey the authority. Additionally, the premise does not give us information about the specific scenario or circumstances in which this defiance occurs. It may be possible that the person defying the authority has no legal or moral reason to obey the person in question. Alternatively, the authority figure may be using their power unethically or unjustly, making the defiance warranted. In cases such as these, the hypothesis \\"You don't need to obey me\\" might hold true. On the other hand, if the authority figure holds a legitimate position of power and the individual defying them indeed has a legal or moral obligation to follow their orders, the hypothesis \\"You don't need to obey me\\" could be false. For example, if an employer requests an employee to complete a work task and the employee defies the request, the hypothesis would likely not hold true. Moreover, the premise \\"You defy me?\\" can also be interpreted as a rhetorical question or a statement of disbelief, rather than a direct question about the necessity of obeying. In that sense, it does not address the hypothesis at all, making it impossible to draw any conclusions based on the premise alone. In conclusion, without further context and additional information surrounding the relationship between the individuals, the authority structure, and the nature of the defiance, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis \\"You don't need to obey me\\" is true based on the premise \\"You defy me?\\"."},{"question":"Answer the following question: how many seasons did michael jordan play in the nba?","response":"Michael Jordan, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, played a total of 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). His illustrious career was divided into three distinct phases. The first phase of Jordan's NBA career was with the Chicago Bulls, which spanned 13 seasons. He began his professional basketball journey when the Chicago Bulls selected him as the third overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan played for the Bulls from the 1984-85 season to the 1992-93 season, before temporarily retiring from basketball for the first time. This phase is often referred to as his prime years, during which he helped the Bulls win their first-ever NBA Championship and create a modern basketball dynasty. The team won three consecutive championships, known as a \\"three-peat,\\" from 1991 to 1993. In October 1993, Jordan decided to retire and pursue a career in baseball, citing a loss of desire to play basketball and the tragic murder of his father earlier that year. Jordan signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox and spent the 1994 season playing baseball. The second phase began when Jordan returned to the NBA and rejoined the Chicago Bulls during the 1994-95 season. He announced his return with a simple yet powerful statement: \\"I'm back.\\" Even though he had been away from basketball for over a year, Jordan's skills and impact on the Bulls were undeniable. He led them to another three-peat from 1996 to 1998, bringing the Bulls' total championship count to six during Jordan's tenure. After claiming his sixth and final NBA title, Jordan retired from the league once more in January 1999. The third and final phase of Jordan's career occurred when he came out of retirement for a second time to play for the Washington Wizards. He signed with the team in September 2001 and played for two seasons, from 2001-2002 to 2002-2003. While his statistics during this period were still respectable, he was no longer the dominant force he had been during his glory days in Chicago. Ultimately, Jordan retired for the last time in April 2003. In summary, Michael Jordan played a total of 15 seasons in the NBA, with 13 seasons for the Chicago Bulls (1984-1993, 1995-1998) and 2 seasons for the Washington Wizards (2001-2003). His legendary contributions to the sport of basketball remain unmatched, and his influence continues to be felt on and off the court."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often. It is only when we can notsee perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark.

Hypothesis: \\"The man is also wearing a green shirt.\\" This statement is about the man's shirt and its color. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: The premise provides information about the man's hat and his state (sleeping), but it doesn't mention anything about the man's shirt or its color. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically talks about the man's shirt color.

Explanation: The correct answer is North Korea because the news story is discussing the actions and decisions of North Korea, and the associated political tensions. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - CNN announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches: CNN is a news network, not a nation, and thus cannot plan nuclear tests or rocket launches. - Kim announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches: The given option is incorrect because \\"Kim\\" is not a country or a governing body that can make such a declaration. The correct referent should be \\"North Korea.\\" - Kim Jong Un announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches: The structure of the sentence is grammatically incorrect as 'it' refers to a person, Kim Jong-Un, which should be 'he'. Moreover, it is more logical that the announcement originated from the country (North Korea) than the leader. - North Korean announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches: \\"North Korean\\" typically refers to an individual citizen, not the country. - Pyongyang announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches: Though Pyongyang is the capital of North Korea, announcing this type of news on behalf of a whole country usually involves the country's name instead of a city. - Seoul announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches: Seoul is the capital of South Korea, which is not involved in this situation. - South announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches: \\"South\\" is too ambiguous to discern if it's referring to South Korea or the southern part of North Korea. - South Korea, South Korean, U.S and United States announces it is planning a new nuclear test: These options incorrectly identify South Korea and the United States as the actors planning a new nuclear test, contrary to the news story."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: – A 96-year-old Hungarian police officer has been charged with war crimes committed during World War II, the AP reports. Sandor Kepiro allegedly ordered the killing of four civilians during a massacre of 1,200 that took place in Serbia. Hungarian courts had convicted Kepiro twice in the 1940s, says the Simon Wiesenthal Center's top Nazi hunter, but the first was overturned on retrial, and the second tossed out when court documents were lost. Now, new documents uncovered in Belgrade have given fresh evidence of Kepiro's involvement. The man himself remains adamant: \\"I am innocent and need to be acquitted,\\" he said in a phone interview. \\"I am bedridden and can't leave my home.

Article:","response":"Title: 96-Year-Old Hungarian Police Officer Charged with War Crimes from World War II A 96-year-old Hungarian police officer, Sandor Kepiro, has been charged with war crimes committed during World War II, according to the AP. Kepiro is alleged to have ordered the killing of four civilians during a massacre that took place in Serbia, resulting in the deaths of 1,200 people. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights organization, found new evidence of Kepiro's involvement in the atrocities thanks to recently uncovered documents in Belgrade. This is not the first time Kepiro has faced charges for war crimes; Hungarian courts had convicted him twice in the 1940s. However, the first conviction was overturned on retrial, and the second was dismissed when the court documents were lost. As a result, Kepiro had previously been included on a list of top war criminals sought by the Weisenthal Center. Despite the new evidence, Kepiro remains unwavering in his assertion of innocence. In a phone interview, he stated, \\"I am innocent and need to be acquitted. I am bedridden and can't leave my home. I have nothing.\\" Although currently in poor health and unable to leave his residence, Kepiro now faces renewed efforts to hold him accountable for his alleged actions during World War II. This case highlights the ongoing pursuit of justice by organizations such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the importance of continued efforts in locating and prosecuting individuals accused of war crimes, regardless of age or time passed since the alleged acts. The newly uncovered documents from Belgrade have provided fresh evidence and a chance for the victims' families to seek closure and justice, no matter how many years have passed since the crimes occurred. In conclusion, the charging of the 96-year-old Hungarian police officer, Sandor Kepiro, demonstrates a continued commitment to seeking and upholding justice for war crimes committed during World War II. Though many years have passed since the crimes were committed, this case illustrates the determination to hold perpetrators accountable and serves as a reminder that justice can prevail even after significant delays."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Andre has just returned to Paris in the hope of making some easy money, give up his life of petty crime, and start his life over as an honest man in America.

Question: suppose If bats are outside happens, how will it affect STRONGER echolocation. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"Option A: More When bats are outside, the process of echolocation is generally stronger due to various factors. Here's a detailed explanation as to why. 1. Open Environment: When bats are outside, they usually have a more open environment that enables sound waves to travel efficiently without significant interference. This reduces the chances of echoes being absorbed or distorted by walls or other surfaces, thereby allowing the bat to receive a clearer and more accurate echo. 2. Environmental Variety: Bats have evolved to adapt to their environment, which involves navigating through various outdoor landscapes like forests, open fields, or near water bodies. The variety in landscape types provides diverse opportunities for stronger echolocation as the surroundings differ in terms of the composition and arrangement of objects. This constant change in conditions has allowed bats to develop advanced echolocation capabilities for outdoor environments. 3. Weather Conditions: Although bats' echolocation system can be affected by certain weather elements such as heavy rain or strong winds, the outdoor environment also presents a range of acoustic cues advantageous to the bat's overall perception of the surroundings. For example, warm temperatures can improve sound wave propagation, while humidity may enhance the acoustic contrast between objects and the background atmosphere. 4. Prey Detection: The primary motivation behind the evolution of echolocation in bats is prey detection and capture. When hunting outdoors, bats benefit from a greater diversity of potential prey, making their echolocation even more vital. In order to effectively locate and hunt prey in these complex environments, it is essential for bats to have stronger echolocation, which has led to the continuous adaptation and improvement of this sense over time. 5. Social Interaction: Bats often live and forage in groups, making communication and interaction essential to their survival. When outside, bats must locate other group members, avoid collisions, and share information about food sources and potential threats. Enhanced echolocation allows for more precise location and identification of other bats, leading to improved coordination among group members and overall social cohesion. In conclusion, outdoor conditions prompt bats to establish stronger echolocation due to the open environment, environmental variety, fluctuating weather conditions, higher prey detection demands, and the importance of social interaction. This enhanced sense allows bats to better navigate, hunt, and communicate outdoors, ensuring their survival in their natural habitat."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - The Miss Massachusetts USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Massachusetts in the Miss USA pageant. - Miss Universe is an annual international beauty pageant that is run by the Miss Universe Organization.
