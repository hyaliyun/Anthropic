In his twenties he tried to create diamonds by heating graphite and shorted out Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst. He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth. Baird's numerous other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary and began to dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer. Baird's other developments were in fibre-optics, radio direction finding, infrared night viewing and radar. There is discussion about his exact contribution to the development of radar, for his wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the UK government. According to Malcolm Baird, his son, what is known is that in 1926 Baird filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that he was in correspondence with the British government at the time. The radar contribution is in dispute. According to some experts, Baird's \\"noctovision\\" is not radar. Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject. Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space. Answer this question \\"Were there any problems with it?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"Yes, there were problems with some of Baird's early inventions, such as the unsuccessful attempts to create diamonds, a glass razor that shattered, and pneumatic shoes with bursting semi-inflated balloons. Additionally, his early video recording device, Phonovision, faced technical difficulties that prevented its further development.

The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. Now, I have a new situation: Jake and his brother Jordan both have to go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled. Jake is allergic to the anesthetic unfortunately, so he has to have the procedure done without it. Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected. Answer this question please: Who will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes? Answer:","response":"Jake will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes. Since he is allergic to the anesthetic, he cannot receive the anesthetic injection that would affect the membrane structure and ion movement, thus he undergoes the tooth extraction without any anesthetic. On the other hand, Jordan, who is not allergic, receives the anesthetic injection and will experience a disruption in ion movement in his cell membranes. This disruption blocks his nerve impulses, preventing him from feeling pain during the procedure until the anesthetic wears off."},{"question":"Given the question: Article: About ten men in every hundred have the trouble of color blindness in some way. Women are luckier, only about one in two hundred is affected in this matter. Perhaps, after all ,it is safer to be driven by a woman. There are different kinds of color blindness. For example, a man cannot see deep red. He may think that red, orange and yellow are all shades of green. Sometimes a person can't tell the difference between blue and green. Only a few unlucky men may see everything in shades of green-- a strange world indeed. Color blindness in human beings is a different thing to explain. In only one eye there are millions of very small things called \\"cones \\" . These help us to see in the bright light and to tell differences between colors. These are also millions of \\"rods\\" ,but these are used for seeing when it is nearly dark. They show us shapes but not colors. Some insects have favorite colors. Mosquitoes like blue but do not like yellow. A red light will not attract insects, but a blue light will. Human beings also have favorite colors. Yet we are lucky. With the help of the cones in our eyes, we can see many beautiful colors by day, and with the help of the rods we can see shapes at night.

The total area of Macao is about 21.45 square kilometers, and it is made up of three parts: Macao Peninsula, Dingbat Isle and Lehman Isle. Between Macao Peninsula and Dingbat Isle there are two bridges which join the two parts together, and there is also a highway between the Dingbat and Lehman Isles. Therefore, two bridges and one highway make the three parts of Macao into an integrated region . Macao faces to the vast sea and its back is the Pearl River Delta.

If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Intellectual history and social history are used in what?","response":"Intellectual history and social history are both used in the study of the history of ideas, institutions, cultures, and societies. Both intellectual and social history provide valuable perspectives and methodologies for examining the complex and evolving nature of human experiences in various contexts. They offer insights into the dynamics of change and continuity in human thought, behavior, and social organization across time and space. Intellectual history focuses on the exploration of ideas, ideologies, and philosophies that have shaped human thinking and culture through time. It is concerned with understanding how these ideas and beliefs have influenced individuals, communities, and societies. Intellectual historians analyze concepts, theories, and intellectual movements that have guided human actions and decisions, ranging from political theories to scientific paradigms, from religious doctrines to artistic styles and literary genres. Some key aspects of intellectual history include the study of: 1. The development of philosophies and theories: This entails examining the growth and evolution of various branches of intellectual thought, such as political theory, ethics, aesthetics, and epistemology. 2. The intellectual biography of prominent thinkers: This involves tracing the intellectual journeys of significant individuals, exploring their contributions to specific fields, and assessing their impact on broader cultural and social trends. 3. The relationship between ideas and social contexts: This means exploring how social and historical factors have shaped intellectual debates and how these debates have in turn influenced society. Social history, on the other hand, focuses on the investigation of the lived experiences and social interactions of people in historical contexts. It examines the role of social structures, institutions, and practices in shaping human behavior, identity, and collective action. By analyzing the dynamics of social organization, cultural norms, and social movements, social historians shed light on the ways in which human societies have evolved and transformed over time. Key aspects of social history include the study of: 1. Demographic and economic trends: This entails exploring how population growth, migration, urbanization, and economic developments have influenced social structures and cultural practices. 2. Social structures and institutions: This involves examining the various social institutions, such as family, education, religion, and politics, their functions, and how they interact with one another to shape societies. 3. Social movements and collective action: This includes an analysis of political, religious, and cultural movements that have played a significant role in redefining norms and values, challenging social inequalities, or representing marginalized groups. In sum, both intellectual and social history are vital approaches that contribute to our understanding of human history in its diverse aspects. They offer researchers and scholars the tools to unravel the intricacies of human thought and social life, illuminating the processes and factors that have informed our shared past and continue to shape our present."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Hydrocarbons may form straight chains, branched chains, or rings.

They are vastly different in context and subject matter as one focuses on marketing techniques within the indie game development industry, while the other discusses political implications and cyber security concerns surrounding the US presidential elections. Additionally, the inquiries are inquiring about two separate concepts: guidance on marketing techniques versus reasons and methods behind a nation's alleged hacking endeavors. The first question, \\"What marketing techniques should follow a sole indie game developer?\\", is seeking advice on effective marketing strategies and best practices that an individual indie game developer (a developer working independently without the support of a large gaming company or publisher) should follow in order to promote their games and reach their target audience. In this context, the question might be directed to someone familiar with the gaming industry and its marketing landscape. Potential answers to this question could include recommendations for leveraging social media platforms, attending networking events and conventions, collaborating with influencers or content creators, building an email list, or creating game trailers. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Why and how is Russia being accused of hacking the US presidential elections?\\", refers to a political and cyber-security related topic. This question aims to uncover details regarding the reasons and methods behind the allegations of Russian interference in the US presidential elections, specifically focusing on hacking and cyber attacks. Relevant information to address this question may include official statements from the government, intelligence agencies or independent researchers; analysis of digital forensics and cyber-security reports; as well as examination of geopolitical motivations, historical context, and possible consequences. Frequently, this question is tackled by addressing the evidence of Russian hacking, such as the infiltration of political party servers, the spread of misinformation and targeted cyber attacks on election infrastructure. In conclusion, these questions do not share the same meaning due to their differing subjects. They explore separate industries and challenges, namely marketing techniques for indie game developers versus the implications and techniques behind alleged election hacking efforts.

Choices: - the sky - air - earth - space shuttle - water The rationale to choose \\"air\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"You should choose \\"air\\" as the answer because the air in the Earth's atmosphere is the most accessible and abundant source of oxygen to sustain life. Here is the rationale explained in further detail: 1. Air: The Earth's atmosphere comprises roughly 21% oxygen, making it the best choice for obtaining oxygen. It is an essential component for humans and many other organisms to breathe and survive. Air is readily available on the surface of the Earth, and it is the primary source of oxygen for combustion, respiration, and other essential processes. 2. The Sky: Although the sky is technically the visual representation of the atmosphere above us, it does not refer to a specific source of oxygen. Choosing the sky would be too vague and not directly designate the source. 3. Earth: The term \\"Earth\\" in this context refers to the planet as a whole, including its physical and chemical composition. It doesn't specify a source of oxygen; instead, it merely indicates the world we live on. 4. Space Shuttle: A space shuttle is a vehicle used for space exploration and travel. While the shuttle has an oxygen supply for astronauts inside, it is not a primary or accessible source of oxygen for people on Earth. The space shuttle's oxygen supply comes from Earth and serves a limited quantity for specific purposes. 5. Water: Water is a chemical compound consisting of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O). Though it contains oxygen, it is not an accessible source for humans to breathe directly. Instead, oxygen from the air dissolves into water, and aquatic creatures such as fish utilize this dissolved oxygen. To separate the oxygen from water, you would need to apply a process such as electrolysis, which isn't feasible for daily oxygen consumption. In summary, the best choice for obtaining oxygen is from the air due to its accessibility, abundance, and the fact that it directly provides the oxygen required by living organisms for respiration and other vital processes."},{"question":"Switzerland's ecosystems can be particularly fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies.

Article: Bill Javis took over our village news-agency at a time of life when most of us only want to relax. He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \\"What's wrong, Bill?\\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine. Stopping the bell, Bill held the thing up and called back, \\"Ten to four, you see, and this is dead right.\\" I had never known anyone carrying a brass alarm clock round with him before.

Zatoichi has a distinguished reputation as a swordsman and Sukegoro thinks he is money well spent. Shigezo responds by hiring a ronin of similar repute, Miki Hirate (Shigeru Amachi). Ichi is a meek and humble man who is commonly underestimated by most men, and looked upon suspiciously. His being a masseur, which was a position of low regard in feudal Japan, merely increases the hostility that is shown towards him. They even try to take advantage of his blindness in a gambling den, but from early on it is clear that Zatoichi draws strength from his disability. The only person who respects him is Hirate, who has a similar code of practice. Though Hirate and Ichi know they must fight when the war begins, they develop a kind of friendship. Hirate is eager to fight Zatoichi, as he is terminally ill with tuberculosis and considers death at the hands of a master swordsman preferable. As Hirate becomes increasingly sick, Sukegoro decides to attack Shigezo. He also tells Ichi that he is no longer needed. However, as the war begins, Shigezo informs Hirate of his fallback plan since Hirate is ill, that he intends to shoot Ichi with his rifle. Hirate drags himself from his bed to fight Zatoichi on the condition that the rifle is left behind. Ichi learns from a boy at the temple where Hirate was staying that Hirate will be fighting after all, and also learns the reason. Zatoichi travels to the battle to duel with the dying samurai. After the tense final fight, in which Zatoichi prevails, Zatoichi leaves Iioka and rejects the advances of Otane (Masayo Banri), who has become disillusioned with the yakuza lifestyle, to continue as a solitary wanderer.

A flower may have to wait a long time for the right animals to come by. What if one never passes close enough to the flower? Hoping the wind will blow is also risky for a plant. What if the wind does not blow? What if the blowing pollen does not land on another flower? The wind could even blow the pollen over the ocean where it is wasted. Giving free nectar is costly. It is not a good use of the plants energy. A plant uses a lot of energy to produce nectar. Some animals may just drink the nectar. They may not carry off any pollen in return.

How the Amazon Queen Penthesilea, mangled in the tragedy of her lover Achilles, is a result of an error and then kills herself. In this poignant tale, we see the complexity of human emotions and the tragic consequences that can arise when individuals ignore societal norms in pursuit of their own desires. The story of the Amazon Queen Penthesilea and her lover, Achilles, serves as a prime example of the extent to which one's internal feelings can drive them to extreme actions, especially when those feelings are not in alignment with the expectations of the society in which they exist. Penthesilea, the fierce and powerful Queen of the Amazons, personifies this inner struggle as she embarks on a quest to prove her strength and prowess in battle. The Amazons, as a society, value and celebrate their warrior women, often placing them on equal footing with men. This creates a unique challenge for Penthesilea, as her intense love for the Greek warrior Achilles defies the expectations and rules of her people. The Queen's love manifests itself in a desire to kill her lover, only to watch him rise again stronger to face her in battle. This tragic cycle of death and rebirth serves as a metaphor for the intricate and harrowing interplay of love, power, and societal expectations. The tragedy reaches its climax when, due to a catastrophic error, Penthesilea succeeds in killing Achilles not on the battlefield, but at a time when the two are meant to be enjoying a brief respite from the violence that so closely defines their relationship. In this horrifically ironic twist, the Queen's greatest desire, to have her love for Achilles outweigh her societal obligations, leads to the ultimate conclusion - his untimely death by her own hand. Distraught and consumed with guilt, Penthesilea cannot bear to live with the knowledge that she has caused the death of her lover and defied the very principles her people hold dear. In an act of ultimate despair, she takes her own life, leaving behind not only a heartbroken society but an eternal reminder of the dangers inherent in living a life governed solely by one's innermost feelings. Through the tragic story of Penthesilea and Achilles, Kleist vividly illustrates the potential pitfalls that await individuals who choose to prioritize their desires over the expectations of their community. The heartrending tale serves as a stark reminder: while one must always consider and respect one's own feelings, they must also remember the potential consequences of their actions and the impact they may have on the world around them. By striking a balance between these two essential aspects of human experience, individuals may be better equipped to navigate the twists and turns of life, both in matters of love and in their larger involvement with society."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: One day a red rose blossomed in a forest.

Stand or sit up straight. Set the cursor to zero. Inhale deeply. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth. Blow forcefully into the meter. Repeat the test twice more.\\"","response":"Title: Maximizing the Accuracy of Your Spirometry Test: A Step-By-Step Guide Introduction Spirometry is an essential test used to assess lung function and diagnose various respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis. This non-invasive procedure measures the volume and speed of the air you inhale and exhale, providing vital information about your lung capacity and function. To obtain accurate results, it is crucial to follow the correct steps when performing the test. This comprehensive guide walks you through each stage for an optimal spirometry experience. 1. Examining the Spirometer for Obstructions Before beginning the test, it is necessary to inspect the spirometer to ensure there are no obstructions or debris that could negatively affect the test results. Remove any visible obstructions or dirt from the mouthpiece or turbine chamber that could potentially hinder the airflow. Faulty or improperly maintained devices may provide false results, which can lead to misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment. Therefore, it is vital to use an adequately functioning device. 2. Positioning Yourself Correctly Proper posture plays a crucial role in achieving accurate spirometry readings. Standing or sitting up straight enables your chest and lungs to fully expand and contract, allowing you to take deep breaths and exhale completely. Slouching or bending over may restrict your breathing capacity and result in unreliable data. Make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart if standing or firmly planted on the ground if sitting. Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed throughout the test. 3. Setting the Cursor to Zero Before beginning the test, it is essential to reset the spirometer to ensure it starts from scratch. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to set the device's cursor to zero. This step is necessary for obtaining accurate measurements and ensures that any previous test results will not influence your readings. 4. Taking a Deep Inhalation To achieve the most accurate results, it is crucial to inhale deeply before blowing into the spirometer. This allows you to fill your lungs to their maximum capacity and measure a broader range of lung function. Breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose, filling your lungs entirely with air. You should feel your chest and abdomen expanding as you do this. 5. Placing the Mouthpiece After inhaling deeply, immediately place the spirometer's mouthpiece between your lips. Ensure that your lips form a tight seal around the device to prevent any air from escaping during the test. The mouthpiece should not be inserted too far into your mouth to avoid any gag reflex. It is also essential to use a disposable mouthpiece or use a clean and sanitized one, especially if sharing the device with others to prevent cross-contamination and maintain hygiene. 6. Blowing Forcefully into the Meter Once the mouthpiece is in place, exhale as forcefully and quickly as you can. It is essential to give your best effort when blowing into the spirometer, as a weak or hesitant attempt can lead to inaccurate results. Try to sustain the force throughout the entire exhalation and push out as much air from your lungs as possible. The spirometer will record the airflow and generate data pertaining to your lung function. 7. Repeating the Test for Consistency To ensure the results are reliable, it is recommended to repeat the test two more times, providing you with three sets of data for comparison. Take a short break between each attempt and maintain the proper technique throughout each test. Most modern spirometers will automatically calculate the average values from multiple tests. Conclusion Following these steps will help you achieve accurate and reliable spirometry results, aiding in the correct diagnosis and optimal treatment of potential respiratory issues. Remember to consult your healthcare provider if you experience any discomfort or difficulty during the test. By taking an active role in the assessment of your lung function, you can contribute to your overall health and well-being."},{"question":"Sentence from a movie review: possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?

On their arrival, they are horrified to find a dead man in the property; before they can report the discovery they are confronted by Duke, a gangland boss, and his henchmen who have, it transpires, been using the empty property as a hide-out for stolen valuables which they are planning to smuggle out of the country. A rival gangster, Juan, also has his eye on the goods and has discovered their whereabouts. The dead man is one of his minions.

Test sentence: \\"This problem, the sooner you solve the more easily you'll satisfy the folks up at corporate headquarters.\\" Step 1: Identify the main subject and verb. The main subject of the sentence is \\"This problem.\\" However, the main verb is unclear as there are a few verb phrases within the sentence (\\"solve,\\" \\"you'll satisfy\\"). Step 2: Break the sentence into clauses. Clause 1: the sooner you solve (dependent) Clause 2: the more easily you'll satisfy the folks up at corporate headquarters (dependent) Step 3: Determine if the sentence structure is correct. The sentence starts with the subject (\\"This problem\\") but does not have a clear main verb corresponding to the subject. The two clauses that follow are both dependent, meaning they cannot stand alone as complete sentences. Therefore, the sentence is incomplete and grammatically incorrect. Step 4: Suggest a revision to make the sentence grammatically correct. One possible revision to make the sentence grammatically correct is: \\"The sooner you solve this problem, the more easily you'll satisfy the folks up at corporate headquarters.\\" The revised sentence now has a clear main subject (\\"you\\") and verb (\\"solve\\") and consists of two dependent clauses forming a complete and coherent sentence.

Mamie, in a plush Gainsborough hat and a gown of wine-coloured silk, sat, an apparent queen, among her rude surroundings and companions. The dusky litter of the cabin set off her radiant trimness: tarry Johnson was a foil to her fair beauty; she glowed in that poor place, fair as a star; until even I, who was not usually of her admirers, caught a spark of admiration; and even the captain, who was in no courtly humour, proposed that the scene should be commemorated by my pencil. It was the last act of the evening. Hurriedly as I went about my task, the half-hour had lengthened out to more than three before it was completed: Mamie in full value, the rest of the party figuring in outline only, and the artist himself introduced in a back view, which was pronounced a likeness.

Possible answers: 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no;","response":"1). Yes The second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Let's analyze both sentences to understand why: Sentence 1: His religious conversion won him the support of the papacy, and Mieszko effectively founded the Polish state the following year. In this sentence, we are given two pieces of information: a) Mieszko's religious conversion won him the support of the papacy. b) Mieszko effectively founded the Polish state the following year. This sentence indicates that there was a religious conversion for Mieszko and subsequently, he gained the support of the papacy. Then, in the year following this event, Mieszko founded the Polish state. The sentence implies that the founding of the Polish state is related to him gaining the papacy's support. Sentence 2: Mieszko founded the Polish state after he won the support of the papacy. This statement also presents two pieces of information: a) Mieszko won the support of the papacy. b) He founded the Polish state afterward. This sentence concisely indicates that Mieszko won the support of the papacy and then founded the Polish state. The implication is that the founding of the Polish state is a consequence or at least related to winning support from the papacy. Since both sentences have the same key information mentioned, and the order of events is the same, we can conclude that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 is also true. Hence, the answer is: 1) Yes"},{"question":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"Best Reader Yet Can't explain\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Movie title: A Separation Movie plot: Simin wants to leave the country with her husband, Nader, and daughter, Termeh, as the former does not want Termeh to grow up under the prevailing conditions. This desire is not shared by Nader, who is concerned for his father, who lives with the family and suffers from Alzheimer's disease. When Nader determines to stay in Iran, Simin files for divorce. The family court judges the couple's problems insufficient to warrant divorce and rejects Simin's application. She leaves her husband and daughter and moves back in with her parents. On the recommendation of Simin, Nader hires Razieh, a young, deeply religious woman from a poor suburb, to take care of his father while he is at work. Razieh has applied for the job without consulting her hot-tempered husband, Hodjat, whose approval, according to tradition, would have been required. Her family is financially dependent on the job, and she takes her daughter to the house with her. Razieh soon becomes overwhelmed by taking care of Nader's father, which is physically and emotionally demanding. She finds the work very heavy, especially as she is pregnant. One day, Nader and Termeh return to discover her grandfather lying unconscious on the floor in his bedroom, with one of his arms tied to the bed. Razieh is nowhere to be found.

The answer is:","response":"In the movie \\"A Separation,\\" Nader accuses Razieh of neglecting his father and stealing money from his room. This accusation stems from an incident where Nader and his daughter, Termeh, return home to find Nader's father, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, lying unconscious on the floor with one of his arms tied to the bed. Razieh, who was hired to care for Nader's father, is not present during this time. Upon Razieh's return, Nader confronts her about her apparent negligence in caring for his father. He also accuses her of theft, claiming that money has gone missing from his room. However, it is later revealed that Nader's wife, Simin, had actually used the money to pay movers. Despite this, Nader is infuriated by Razieh's supposed actions, which leads him to shove her out of the apartment, causing her to fall in the stairwell outside. This event results in Razieh suffering a miscarriage, leading to an investigation being launched to determine if Nader was responsible for it. If it is discovered that Nader knew about Razieh's pregnancy and still chose to shove her, he could be charged with murder. Throughout the film, Hodjat, Razieh's hot-tempered husband, confronts and threatens Nader multiple times in regards to the situation. Overall, the central conflict and accusation in \\"A Separation\\" involve Nader accusing Razieh of neglecting her duties in caring for his father and stealing money from his room.

In this passage, Paul provides guidance and instructions to believers on how to live a life that pleases God and maintains a strong Christian witness. The verse essentially instructs followers of Jesus to stay away from anything that is morally or spiritually harmful. By avoiding evil in all its forms, Christians can maintain an upright character and set a positive example in the community, thereby reflecting the teachings and life of Jesus Christ. Paul's advice can be taken as a general principle for all believers, regardless of their specific situations or cultural contexts. The idea of avoiding every kind of evil can be applied to various areas of life, such as behavior, relationships, thoughts, and words. Examples of how to avoid evil in different aspects of life are: 1. Behavior: Refraining from actions that cause harm to others or oneself, such as violence, dishonesty, or substance abuse. 2. Relationships: Choosing relationships that promote spiritual growth and healthy communication, and distancing oneself from relationships that encourage sin or destructive habits. 3. Thoughts: Being aware of mental patterns that lead to negative emotions or actions, and replacing them with positive, life-giving thoughts. 4. Words: Using language that is uplifting and encouraging, rather than engaging in gossip, slander, or abrasive language that may hurt others. By adhering to this guidance, Christians can live in a way that is consistent with their faith, positively impacting those around them, and demonstrating the transformative power of Jesus' teachings in everyday life."},{"question":"On the bright side, the Journal reports that Twinkies are making a comeback. Does it follow that \\"The Journal runs stories about popular culture often.\\"?","response":"The statement \\"Twinkies are making a comeback\\" from the Journal can serve as an indication that the Journal might cover popular culture topics at times. However, it is not sufficient to conclude that the Journal frequently runs stories about popular culture based solely on a single instance of reporting on the resurgence of Twinkies. To determine whether the Journal generally covers popular culture stories, it would be helpful to examine multiple articles and the overall content of the publication. Some factors to consider include: 1. Subject Matter - Look for other examples of the Journal's articles which focus on popular culture, such as trends, well-known personalities or celebrities, and entertainment news. If a majority or a significant portion of the published content seems to be focused on these topics, then it would be fair to assert that the Journal regularly covers popular culture. 2. Publication Frequency - Another important factor to consider is the frequency with which the Journal covers popular culture stories. Are these articles published consistently, or do they appear sporadically and occasionally? Frequency can help determine whether popular culture coverage is a mainstay of the Journal's content or just a supplementary element. 3. Audience Engagement - Analyzing how readers engage with the popular culture stories can also give insight into the popularity of such content within the Journal. If articles relating to popular culture receive high levels of engagement in terms of likes, comments, and shares, it may suggest that the Journal's audience is interested in these topics, pushing the publication to provide more related content. 4. Editorial Focus - Investigating the Journal's editorial focus, mission statement, and target audience can provide additional information about whether it often covers popular culture stories. Newspapers and magazines may have specific sections or columns dedicated to popular culture, which can also be an indicator of the emphasis placed on these topics. In conclusion, while the mention of a story about Twinkies making a comeback demonstrates that the Journal covers popular culture topics in some capacity, it is not sufficient to definitively claim that it runs stories about popular culture often. A deeper analysis of the content, frequency, audience engagement, and editorial focus would be necessary to accurately determine the prevalence of popular culture stories within the Journal."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

If you don't have time to \\" de-crease \\" it days ahead of time, lay a sheet over the top and apply a warm iron to the sheet.","response":"After the shower curtain has been laid out and de-creased, if necessary, follow these steps to create a mega tic tac toe board: 1. Gather materials: To make the tic tac toe grid lines, you will need colored duct tape or electrical tape, a straightedge or ruler, a measuring tape for precise positioning, a pair of scissors, and a pencil or chalk. 2. Measure the dimensions: For standard 9-grid tic tac toe, locate the mid-point of the shower curtain by measuring the length and width and dividing them by two. If the shower curtain is large enough, consider creating a larger grid, like 16 squares (4x4) for added fun. 3. Draw guidelines: Lightly mark the positions of the grid lines using a pencil or chalk. Use the midpoint from step 2 as a reference for placing the equally spaced horizontal and vertical lines. For a 3x3 grid, two horizontal lines and two vertical lines will be drawn. For a 4x4 grid, three horizontal lines and three vertical lines are required. 4. Apply the tape: Carefully apply the tape along the marked guidelines. Use the straightedge or ruler to ensure the tape is evenly and straightly placed. Press firmly on the tape to secure it to the shower curtain. 5. Add boundary lines (optional): Apply additional tape around the entire perimeter of the tic tac toe grid to create a defined boundary and keep the focus on the playing area. 6. Create game pieces: To play mega tic tac toe, you'll need large X and O pieces. These can be made with materials like fabric, foam, cardboard, or even pool noodles cut into appropriate shapes. The pieces should be large enough to comfortably fill a single square of the grid on the shower curtain. Ensure you have an equal number of X and O pieces for each player. 7. Prepare the playing area: The mega tic tac toe board is best played outdoors or in a spacious indoor area. Clear the space of any obstacles and lay the shower curtain board on the ground with the grid lines facing up. Secure the corners of the curtain with duct tape or tent pegs, if needed. 8. Choose teams and play: Divide participants into two teams and assign either X or O to each team. The goal of the game remains the same: to connect three (or four, depending on the size of your grid) of their respective markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns placing their team's game pieces on the shower curtain grid until either a winning combination is achieved or the game reaches a draw. 9. Cleanup and storage: After playing, remove the game pieces and fold the shower curtain for easy storage. The duct tape grid should remain intact for multiple uses. Store the game pieces separately in a bag or container. Creating a mega tic tac toe board is not only an exciting party activity but also a fun outdoor game to be enjoyed by people of all ages. With a little bit of effort and creativity, you can put together an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for everyone involved."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

This is usually a negative or not-so-good thing when we're talking about movies. Maybe he wanted the movie to be a bit faster, with more things happening quicker, you know, like when you're playing and you want things to be exciting and fun, not slow and boring.

But he said it was slow paced, which isn't usually a compliment or a nice thing to say about a movie. That's a bit like saying you didn't enjoy your playtime because your friend was moving too slow during the game."},{"question":"Asphalt: Synthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct, but there is more information needed for a complete understanding of Freedom Summer. Freedom Summer, also known as the Mississippi Summer Project, was a 1964 voter registration drive aimed at increasing the number of registered African American voters in Mississippi. It was organized by the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), which was indeed a coalition of the Mississippi branches of the four major civil rights organizations: the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The project had three main objectives: 1. Register African American voters, whose rights to vote had been suppressed systematically by discriminatory policies and intimidation. 2. Establish \\"Freedom Schools,\\" which were alternative educational institutions designed to teach African American students about their history, civil rights, and leadership skills. These schools aimed to empower and inspire the students to become active members of their communities. 3. Form the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which was an integrated alternative to the all-white Mississippi Democratic Party. This new party challenged the legitimacy of the existing party during the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Freedom Summer brought national attention to the brutal racial oppression in Mississippi and marked a significant turning point in the Civil Rights Movement. The summer was marred by violence, including the murders of three civil rights workers (James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner) in Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. However, the events of Freedom Summer fueled the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited discriminatory voting practices and ultimately helped to dismantle institutionalized racism in the United States."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Solanum incompletum - Solanum incompletum is a rare species of flowering plant in the nightshade family known by the common names thorny popolo and popolo ku mai.

The band's discography has grown to thirty-eight albums, including sixteen studio albums, twelve live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations. Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live Context: Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributes the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which reminded him of the iron maiden torture device. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford. The original line-up did not last very long, however, with vocalist Paul Day being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \\"energy or charisma on stage\\". He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances. Wilcock's friend Dave Murray was invited to join, to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance. Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976, though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Steve Harris and Dave Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases. Iron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth. Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, as well as original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson. At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound. A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided that he had had enough with the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated. As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return and was also dismissed. Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, \\"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\\" At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \\"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.\\" Question: Did they tour during the early years? Answer:","response":"Yes, Iron Maiden toured during their early years. Following their formation in 1975 and multiple line-up changes, the band worked hard to establish themselves within the music scene. They started performing live shows at local venues like St. Nicks Hall, Poplar, and took up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford. Throughout the late 1970s, Iron Maiden continued to perform in bars, pubs, and small clubs in and around London. These early performances helped them gain recognition within the British music scene, and their fan base started to grow. In 1979, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, \\"The Soundhouse Tapes,\\" which gained attention from DJ Neal Kay and caught the interest of various labels. Ultimately, they signed with the indie label EMI in December 1979. Iron Maiden embarked on their first major tour, the \\"Metal for Muthas Tour,\\" in early 1980, along with other up-and-coming British bands. The tour played a significant role in popularizing the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) movement. They released their self-titled debut album on April 14, 1980, which quickly gained recognition and reached number four on the UK Albums Chart. Subsequent years saw the band touring extensively in support of their subsequent albums and taking part in famous tours such as \\"Killer World Tour\\" in 1981 and \\"The Beast on the Road\\" in 1982. These tours not only expanded their fan base within the United Kingdom but also introduced them to audiences in Europe and North America, solidifying their status as a leading heavy metal band. In summary, Iron Maiden did tour during their early years, playing local gigs before embarking on significant tours that played a vital role in promoting the band and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. Their continuous touring and energetic live performances contributed to their success and the growth of their devoted fan base."},{"question":"Answer this question: where does can't buy me love take place??","response":"\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is a movie from 1987, and it takes place in a school and around a neighborhood in Tucson, Arizona, in the United States.

A 'prime number' is a a whole number above 1 that can not be made by multiplying other whole numbers. Input: 57397 Output:","response":"To determine if the given number, 57397, is prime, we will first check if it meets the basic criteria for being a prime number, which is that it cannot be the product of two smaller whole numbers and is greater than 1. One common method to check for prime numbers is the trial division method. Essentially, we will check for divisibility with all the numbers lesser than the square root of the given number. If any of the divisions result in a whole number, it is not a prime number. Let's perform the trial division to test if 57397 is a prime number: Square root of 57397 ≈ 239.57 (rounded up to 240) Now, we will check for divisibility of 57397 by whole numbers from 2 to 240. After testing the divisibility, we find that none of the numbers between 2 and 240 divides 57397 without a remainder. Since the divisibility test doesn't result in any whole number, we can conclude that: Output: Yes 57397 is a prime number."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Arts and crafts are held in high regard in Edinburgh. Sentence 2: Edinburgh enjoys arts and crafts. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's break down the information in both sentences and compare them step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the main subjects and actions in both sentences. Sentence 1: main subject - \\"Arts and crafts\\"; action - \\"are held in high regard\\"; location - \\"in Edinburgh\\" Sentence 2: main subject - \\"Edinburgh\\"; action - \\"enjoys\\"; object - \\"arts and crafts\\" Step 2: Compare the subjects and actions of both sentences. The subjects in both sentences are related – Sentence 1 focuses on arts and crafts, while Sentence 2 focuses on Edinburgh. The actions in both sentences express a positive sentiment towards arts and crafts: \\"held in high regard\\" and \\"enjoys.\\" Based on this comparison, we can infer that there is a relationship between the two sentences. Step 3: Determine if the information in Sentence 1 supports or implies the information in Sentence 2. Since Sentence 1 states that arts and crafts are held in high regard in Edinburgh, it means that the city has a strong appreciation for arts and crafts. This appreciation can be understood as \\"enjoyment\\" in the general sense. Therefore, the first sentence does support and imply the information in the second sentence. Conclusion: Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, as the information in Sentence 1 supports and implies the information in Sentence 2."},{"question":"Sentence 1: A ball of fire.

Nana Sahib (born 19 May 1824 -- disappeared 1857), born as Dhondu Pant, was an Indian Maratha aristocrat and fighter, who led the rebellion in Cawnpore (Kanpur) during the 1857 uprising. As the adopted son of the exiled Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao II, Nana Sahib believed that he was entitled to a pension from the English East India Company, but the underlying contractual issues are rather murky. The Company's refusal to continue the pension after his father's death, as well as what he perceived as high-handed policies, compelled him to revolt and seek independence from company rule in India. He forced the British garrison in Kanpur to surrender, then executed the survivors, gaining control of Cawnpore for a few days. He later disappeared, after his forces were defeated by a British force that recaptured Cawnpore. He was led to the Nepal Hills in 1859, where he is thought to have died.

This task involves applying knowledge of physics principles, evaluating mechanics, and understanding forces acting on structures. Here's a step-by-step breakdown for this task: 1. Determine the design: Before beginning, consider the goal of the bridge, whether it's to support certain types of loads, span specific distances, or other requirements. Based on these factors, choose a suitable design such as a beam, truss, or suspension bridge. 2. Gather materials: Collect the materials that will be used to construct the bridge, which may include wood, metal, plastic, or other materials. Ensure that these materials are strong and able to withstand the expected forces acting on the bridge. 3. Plan the structure: Once the design is decided upon, plan the structure's individual components such as supports, beams, and joints. Consider the distribution of forces acting on these elements and determine their required dimensions, shapes, and orientations. 4. Assemble the components: Connect the bridge's various components together, using methods such as glue, screws, or bolts. Ensure that all connections are secure and that the overall structure is stable. 5. Test the bridge's strength and stability: Gradually apply a load to the bridge, observing how it reacts to the added weight. Analyze any potential stress points and evaluate if the bridge is up to the task. Ensure that the design has been properly executed, and make any necessary modifications to improve its performance. 6. Evaluate the results: Upon completing the testing phase, assess the results and check if the bridge meets the initial goals set for it, such as supporting a specific load or spanning a certain distance. By performing these steps, the individual's ability to apply physical reasoning when constructing a bridge will be put to the test. This approach examines their understanding of forces, load distribution, and overall stability in a practical scenario."},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: 12 There is a way which seems right to a manbut in the end it leads to death","response":"Step 1: Identify the beginning of the sentence.

It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. - The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene. - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp). - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes. - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines. - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. - The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch. - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys. - Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797 22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of \\"Principles of Geology\\", which popularized James Hutton's concepts of uniformitarianismthe idea that the Earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. \\"Principles of Geology\\" also challenged theories popularized by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in England at the time. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology.

I'll select \\"memory and sleep\\" as the topic, as it's both relevant and exciting to many people. Step 2: Research the topic Before I can formulate a hypothesis, I need to understand the context better. I'll search online for articles, scientific studies, and reliable sources about how sleep affects memory. After gathering sufficient information, I'll analyze it and identify patterns or potential relationships. Step 3: Generate context Now that I have a good understanding of the topic, I can generate a context. Here's the context: \\"Many individuals struggle with memory problems, with sleep being among the prime factors affecting memory consolidation. Sleep is vital for numerous brain functions, including the consolidation of long-term memories. According to recent research, different stages of sleep – such as REM sleep and slow-wave sleep – may have distinct roles in memory consolidation. Additionally, sleep deprivation has been shown to negatively affect memory performance.\\" Step 4: Identify a problem or question To create a hypothesis, I'll need to identify a specific problem or question within the context. A possible question could be: \\"How does the quality of sleep affect an individual's ability to remember new information?\\" Step 5: Formulate the hypothesis Based on the context and the generated question, I can now create a hypothesis. Here's the hypothesis: \\"High-quality sleep, characterized by sufficient REM and slow-wave sleep stages, will improve an individual's ability to remember new information, whereas sleep deprivation or sleep disturbances that interfere with these stages will impair memory consolidation processes and negatively affect memory performance.\\" This hypothesis aims to explain the relationship between sleep quality and memory consolidation, and can be tested through experimental research to determine its accuracy or identify potential modifications."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the below conversation.

Sentence 2: She couldn't recall what had happened to the others. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Step 1: Identify the main points in both sentences. In Sentence 1, the main point is that she couldn't recall what had happened to the others, and it is mentioned that this is \\"apparently\\" the case. In Sentence 2, the main point is that she couldn't recall what had happened to the others. Step 2: Compare the main points. Both sentences convey the same main idea, which is her inability to recall what happened to the others. Step 3: Check for additional information or qualifiers in the first sentence. In Sentence 1, there is a qualifier \\"apparently\\" which means that it appears or it is assumed that she couldn't recall what happened to the others. Step 4: Determine if the additional information affects the entailment. The word \\"apparently\\" only indicates how the observation has been made or what appears to be the case, but it does not change the fact that she couldn't recall what had happened to the others. Hence, it doesn't affect the entailment.

You need to provide a rating from \\"1 star\\" to \\"5 stars\\" for this place. Problem:Women's Specialty Care is like a restaurant where the food is great, but the hostess is rude, the waitstaff ignores you, and you're seated next to the bathroom. Good news first: Sheila Tack is awesome -- about the only practitioner ever who has a sense of humor, who's clearly intelligent and compassionate, and who doesn't treat patients like overgrown (and slightly stupid) little girls. When you're talking to Sheila, you get the feeling that, well, you're talking to someone who respects you. She's straightforward and clear and gentle, and I only wish they could clone her.nnNow on to the bad. Calling them is a pain -- you have to listen to their whole phone tree before you hear a person (hint: Press one for English and then jump right to #7). The people on the phone are nice enough, but they often have a hard time comprehending what you're saying, especially if you're asking about medication. It's no fun to have to repeat something (literally) four times and not have much confidence that the well-intended phone person understood you or will relay the message correctly.nnThe front desk staff is just plain rude. When you get the feeling that your icky little gyno problems are really a big interruption in their day -- what with your paperwork and all -- that's a problem. There's a real disregard for patients and their privacy. Specifically, when I was done filling out the paperwork, I came up to the front desk. The front desk person, seeing me, got up and went to chitchat with two other people. I showed her the clipboard to indicate I was done. She didn't acknowledge me and went on chatting. I put the clipboard on the counter, not feeling happy about my personal information -- address, problem I was seeing them about, you know -- being just out on display on the counter. She walked away, leaving it there. When a new patient walked in, I finally just took the clipboard with my paperwork and had to put it on the lower level of her desk. nnNext,, the red tape and inefficiency are outrageous. I wanted to be equipped with a birth control device. Sheila Tack indicated that we'd need approval from my insurance, but said they'd get that, order the gizmo, and be ready to go in about 3-5 days. Coolz. Okay, so when over a week had passed and I still hadn't heard from them, I called. The phone person said they'd make sure to leave a message. It wasn't returned. I called back a day or so later. Finally, the phone message was returned: they said they'd put in the request for authorization. (Really? Only just NOW?) When I called my health insurance to find out what I could do to move this process along, I was told they didn't even need to get authorization -- it was preauthorized. When I called Women's Specialty Care to find out what the heck was going on, I was told what amounts to a complicated labyrinth of \\"X has to approve Y, but if it's Q, then you'll have to order the device and then have it sent to us...\\" blahdiddy blah. Seriously? The issue is that Women's is not a \\"buy and bill\\" organization: that is, they do not stock any birth control in their offices -- it all has to be special-ordered, and that adds an extra layer of time and telephone calls and special-ordering that *you, the patient* will have to deal with...when or if they get around to ordering the medication or gizmo you happen to need. I am sure that if I hadn't made several calls to make sure the staff was doing their job, I'd still be twiddling my thumbs, wondering when my birth control was going to come in. nnDid I mention that it is very, very hard to get a timely appointment? I love Sheila Tack and I understand she is only one (terrific) person...but the next appointment I can get to install the aforementioned birth control gizmo is TEN DAYS AWAY. That's in addition to the two weeks or so that I've waited already for them to pick up the phone and get the authorization they didn't need anyway from my insurance company.nnIn short, I'm looking for another provider. Solution:","response":"Based on the given review, I would rate Women's Specialty Care a \\"2 stars\\" out of 5 stars. The justification for this rating includes: 1. Positive aspects: - Sheila Tack is highly praised for her expertise, humor, intelligence, and compassionate attitude towards patients. Her quality makes the experience at Women's Specialty Care somewhat enjoyable. 2. Negative aspects: - The front desk staff is rude and inattentive to patients and their privacy concerns. - The phone system is not user-friendly, and the staff on the phone often struggles to understand the patient's problems or requests. - The process of getting authorization for birth control devices is needlessly complicated, inefficient, and time-consuming. The situation was further exacerbated by staff's inefficiency and lack of communication. - It is difficult to get an appointment in a timely manner, with waiting periods of up to two weeks or more. Overall, while there are positive aspects of the care provided by Sheila Tack, the numerous negative aspects of the Women's Specialty Care experience significantly outweigh the positive, resulting in a 2-star rating."},{"question":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Article:","response":"Title: Former Labour Minister John Healey Withdraws from Deputy Leadership Race Introduction: John Healey, a former Labour minister, has announced his decision to pull out of the race for the position of the deputy leader of the party. As one of the potential contenders for the role, Healey is now stepping back to allow for other candidates to put forth their ideas, plans, and goals. Reasons for Withdrawal: Although Healey has not explicitly stated his reasons for withdrawing from the race, he has shared in the past his belief that the deputy leader should be someone who can work to rebuild the foundation of the party and establish strong connections within it. It is possible that he feels another candidate may be better suited to the role or that he wants to focus on other important issues within the Labour party. Potential Impact on the Race: With Healey's withdrawal from the race, other contenders may see this as an opportunity to reassess their own candidacies and plans. Those still in the running will need to prove their commitment to the party, as well as showcase their ability to bring about positive changes and drive the Labour party forward. Furthermore, Healey's supporters may now be looking for alternative candidates to support in the race, potentially redistributing votes and altering the balance of the contest. As a senior and respected member of the Labour party, his withdrawal may cause others to reconsider the qualities they are looking for in their next deputy leader. The Labour Party's Road to Recovery: The Labour party has faced significant challenges and controversies in recent years, particularly since the 2019 general election when they suffered an overwhelming defeat. The selection of a new deputy leader, alongside the ongoing leadership race, will greatly impact the future course of the party. As such, the deputy leader must be a strong, unifying figure who is equipped to help the party regain its footing in the political landscape. With Healey no longer vying for the role, it is hoped that the remaining candidates will put forth their vision for not only rebuilding the party but also maintaining a cohesive and effective platform. Conclusion: John Healey's decision to withdraw from the race to become the Labour party's next deputy leader is a significant development within the contest. It remains to be seen who will emerge as the frontrunner in the race, but it is clear that the next deputy leader has a crucial role to play in the revitalization of the party. The Labour party and its supporters will be closely watching the unfolding events, hoping that the chosen candidate can usher in a new era of success and unity."},{"question":"Abradab, genre, Hip hop music; Hip hop music, derivative, Drum and bass What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","response":"Abradab, a prominent artist in the Hip hop music genre, demonstrates a distinctive style that features a unique fusion of traditional Hip hop music elements, as well as incorporating influences from the Drum and bass subgenre, resulting in a refreshing and innovative musical experience."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: Paleo-artist bases painting on the well-preserved skeleton of a boy.

Movie title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored.

Options: (A) 20 (B) 40 (C) 45 (D) 25 (E) 60 Some stream of consciousness:","response":"To solve this problem, you can follow these steps: Let's call the length of the shorter piece \\"x\\" centimeters, and the length of the longer piece \\"y\\" centimeters. According to the problem statement, the shorter piece is 2/5th of the longer piece: x = (2/5)y. The total length of the wire (70 cm) is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two pieces: x + y = 70. Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x: y = (5/2)x. Now, substitute this expression for y into the second equation: x + (5/2)x = 70. Combine the terms on the left: (7/2)x = 70. Now, to find the value of x, we can simply divide both sides of the equation by (7/2): x = 70 / (7/2). Multiply both sides by 2: 2x = 70 * (7/2). Simplify: 2x = 70 * 7 / 2. Now, cancel out the 2 on the right side of the equation: 2x = 35 * 7. Finally, divide both sides by 2: x = 35 * 7 / 2 = 35 * 3.5. Then, x = 122.5 / 3.5 = 35. So the shorter piece will be 35 centimeters long. However, this option is not among the given choices.

It looks like we have n's on both sides of the \\"=\\" sign. To make it easier for us, we want to put all the n's on one side of the \\"=\\", and keep numbers without an n on the other side. Let's move 19*n to the right side, by subtracting 19*n from both sides of the equation. Doing this, we get: 11 = 30 * n - 19 * n Now, let's combine the n's, like adding apples: 11 = 11 * n Do you notice we have 11 on both sides of the equation? We can find the value of n by dividing both sides by 11 now.

Firstly, establishing a relationship with the Serb community in Kosovo is essential for fostering peace, stability, and mutual understanding between different ethnic communities. Recognizing the importance of inclusivity and cooperation demonstrates a commitment to working harmoniously and acknowledging the concerns and needs of all citizens, regardless of their ethnicity or background. This collaboration should be built on trust and dialogue, focusing on bringing people together to work on common goals and solve shared challenges. Secondly, involving the Serbs in Kosovo in the Legislative Assembly is a way of guaranteeing that their voices are heard, and their rights are represented. This is particularly important given the history of the region and the tensions that have arisen due to conflicting political aspirations and ethnocentric perspectives. By participating in the legislative process, these communities can contribute to finding balanced solutions to problems that affect everyone in Kosovo, and gain a sense of belonging by seeing their inputs valued and considered. Moreover, working together with various ethnic communities to create normal living conditions in the region is essential. This includes ensuring equal access to quality education, healthcare, and social services, developing a strong local economy, and creating opportunities for all, regardless of their ethnicity. This collaborative approach can improve the lives of people in the region, foster a sense of unity, and create an environment where people can thrive as a collective, ultimately making Kosovo a more stable and prosperous place to live. In conclusion, making efforts to reach out to the Serbs in Kosovo, involving them in the Legislative Assembly, and collaborating with them to establish normal living conditions is crucial for ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity in the region. By fostering open dialogue, respecting people's rights and adequately considering their concerns, it is possible to create an environment where everyone can flourish and enjoy a higher quality of life."},{"question":"Jamey really wanted a pet dog, so he went to ask his parents. \\"Mom, Dad, can I we get a dog?\\" Jamey's mom and dad thought about this, and then answered him. \\"Having a pet can be a lot of work, Jamey.

These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively.

Question 2: Can I be arrested for Downloading TV series from torrent in India? Select from the following. (i) no; (ii) yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"The answer to both questions is, \\"Yes\\", you can be arrested for downloading a movie torrent and a TV series from torrent in India. It's essential to note that it is illegal to download copyrighted material without proper permission from the content owner in most countries, including India. The two questions both address the illegality of downloading copyrighted material using torrents and the possible consequences of such actions in India. Let me provide a more in-depth explanation. The illegal downloading of copyrighted material (movies, TV series, music, etc.) constitutes a violation of copyright infringement rules. In India, the Copyright Act, 1957, protects the rights of the copyright holders and prohibits unauthorized duplication, distribution, and consumption of the copyright holder's intellectual property. Downloading movies and TV series via torrent is a type of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, which is easy to track by law enforcement and copyright organizations due to the public sharing of IP addresses. As a result, it becomes relatively simple for authorities to identify individuals engaging in the illegal distribution and downloading of copyrighted content. Moreover, Indian authorities have been actively cracking down on websites that facilitate such activities. In recent years, Indian authorities have been working to strengthen their legal framework and enforcement supports to deter online piracy. As per the Information Technology (Copyright Infringement Liability of Online Service Providers) Rules, 2021, even the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may be penalized for their involvement in allowing the access to such illegal content. Additionally, the Government of India can block torrent websites and take legal action against those involved in distributing and downloading copyrighted material through these sites. Penalties for copyright infringement in India include both fines and imprisonment, with potential prison sentences ranging from six months to three years and fines between ₹50,000 to ₹2 lakh (about 675 to 2,700). In conclusion, downloading movies or TV series from torrent websites in India is illegal and can result in severe consequences, including fines and imprisonment. While the probability of being arrested for an individual act might be low, it's essential to understand the risks associated with such activities and consider alternative means to access content, such as legitimate streaming services that provide legal access to copyrighted materials."},{"question":"Find the area of trapezium whose parallel sides are 20 cm and 18 cm long, and the distance between them is 15 cm.

In this case, the main subject is \\"potato\\" and the condition it needs to be in is \\"softer.\\" Step 2: Go through the options and evaluate each one according to its relevance to the subject and the condition. Option A: Optical device - An optical device is related to vision and light manipulation; it has nothing to do with making a potato softer. Therefore, it's not suitable. Option B: Garden patch - A garden patch is where a potato is grown and harvested. Though it is related to potatoes, it is not a place where a potato becomes softer. So, this option is not suitable. Option C: Blender - A blender is used for mixing ingredients and breaking them down into smaller parts. It indeed makes ingredients, including potatoes, softer in a sense but usually turns it into a puree, which might not be the exact meaning of \\"softer\\" in the context of the question. Thus, this option might not be the most suitable. Option D: Pantry - A pantry is a place where food, including potatoes, is stored. Storing potatoes in a pantry doesn't make them softer. Hence, this option is not suitable. Option E: Vegetable stew - A vegetable stew is a dish where various ingredients, including potatoes, are cooked together. Cooking potatoes in a stew makes them softer due to the heat and the moisture they absorb.

The answer to this question is:","response":"Christopher Columbus, the famous explorer known for his four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, was born in the Republic of Genoa, which is modern day Genoa, Italy. To provide additional context, Christopher Columbus was born in the year 1451, though the exact date remains a mystery, as record keeping during this period was not as precise as it is today. Columbus was born into a middle-class family, with his father being a wool merchant. He had a thirst for exploring and travel from early on in his life. This passion eventually led him on a fascinating journey, enabling him to play a monumental role in the history of exploration and contact between the Old and the New World. Bear in mind that the city of his birth, Genoa, was a significant maritime republic in the 15th century. This city-state was one of the most important centers of trade and commerce in its time. This environment might have influenced young Columbus and sparked his interest in maritime adventures, setting him on the path to become an explorer. In summary, it is widely recognized that Christopher Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa, in what is now Italy. His early exposure to a maritime culture in Genoa likely played a critical role in igniting his passion for exploration and discovery. Following his dreams and aspirations, he embarked on multiple journeys that permanently changed the geography of the world. Still, his legacy remains complex due to the impact his discoveries had on indigenous populations."},{"question":"Were all the materials to make a cannon known during the bronze age? Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","response":"To answer whether all the materials to make a cannon were known during the Bronze Age, we need to consider the key components required to create a cannon and the materials available during the Bronze Age. 1. Metal: Cannons are primarily made of metal, with early versions often being made of iron or bronze. The Bronze Age, lasting from approximately 3300 BCE to 1200 BCE, saw the development and widespread use of bronze (an alloy of copper and tin), which would be a suitable material for constructing a cannon. 2. Gunpowder: Another essential component necessary to create a cannon is gunpowder, which was not developed until around the 9th century CE in China. This is long after the Bronze Age ended and, as such, gunpowder was not known during that era. 3. Cannon Design: Knowledge of engineering, metallurgy, and the actual design of a cannon would also be relevant. Even if the materials were available, one would still need the understanding of how to design and create a cannon effectively. There is no evidence that the technology or expertise needed to design and build a cannon was present during the Bronze Age. In conclusion, although the metal component (bronze) was available during the Bronze Age, the critical component of gunpowder and the specific knowledge required to design a cannon were not present during that time. Therefore, it's safe to say that all the materials and knowledge needed to make a cannon were not known during the Bronze Age."},{"question":"Information: - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews.

If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn (voiced by Frank Welker) will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. They have already won nine; so this will be their tenth tournament.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Replace the actions with their corresponding commands: turn left jump turn left jump turn left jump turn left jump jump jump jump 2. Notice the pattern: each turn left is followed by a jump. The sequence has four \\"turn left jump\\" occurrences. We can use the word 'around' to express that the agent should execute the 'jump' command while turning around in the specified direction (left in this case). Additionally, we see that there are four jumps at the end. We can just say \\"jump\\" four times but the term \\"thrice\\" and \\"twice\\" could help reduce the phrase length.

But this week, as most of the Democratic establishment, including all of his presumed major rivals in the 2013 race for mayor, gathers in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Liu is doing his best to attract attention 7,000 miles away in Asia. He is visiting Seoul and Taipei, Taiwan, as part of a four-day whirlwind trip that will feature at least 14 events, including audiences with the mayor of Seoul and the vice president of Taiwan. One of the highlights of the trip came on Tuesday, when he delivered a speech at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul to a packed auditorium of more than 230 people, including 100 exchange students from the State University of New York, Mr. Liu’s alma mater. Mr. Liu, who was born in Taiwan but moved to New York as a child, said he was in Asia to promote business and investment opportunities for the city. The trip also promises to afford him a chance to connect with civic and business leaders who have ties to American immigrant communities and who could be potential donors, according to two people close to Mr. Liu. The host governments are paying for Mr. Liu’s airfare and lodging, which is permissible under city rules. In Seoul, many of Mr. Liu’s activities were arranged by Korea’s consulate in New York City, as well as by Mr. Liu’s office, according to the organizers. The organizers said they had discussed the federal inquiry into the comptroller’s campaign fund-raising, which so far has resulted in the arrests of his former treasurer and a top fund-raiser. “I am aware that Mr. Liu’s staff is under investigation, and we had a staff meeting about this,” said Jang Tae-yeoub, dean of external affairs at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “But we decided to go ahead with his visiting our university because the investigation is ongoing and not final.” Park Yoon-joo, a director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said, “I do not think it is our business to get involved in those domestic political affairs,” before praising Mr. Liu as “a very active, promising leader fostering good relationships with various minority communities including the Korean-Americans.” At times, Mr. Liu touched on the political issues being discussed in Charlotte. Asked about “the most crucial factor in passing the budget,” for instance, he offered a rousing defense of President Obama. He said that “in my opinion, from Day 1, there were some people in Washington who were determined to see President Obama fail,” and he criticized the Tea Party, particularly for “standing in the way and making life difficult for the president.” Mr. Liu also addressed issues that would most likely be highlighted if he ran for mayor next year, including his aggressive auditing of city agencies, his desire to speed up infrastructure development and his personal history as an immigrant who was “made in Taiwan.” The city’s “Asian-American population continues to grow, is talented and is clearly on the move as they serve as our bridge to Asia,” he said to his audience at Hankuk University. “I want all of you to help me build that bridge,” he added, before saying, “Gamsahamnida,” which means “thank you” in Korean. This week’s trip is the fourth that Mr. Liu has taken overseas since becoming comptroller in January 2010, but his first since November 2010. From Seoul, he flew to Taiwan — his birthplace and the island of origin of many of the immigrants who are a dominant force in his Flushing neighborhood. His schedule included visits to two cabinet ministries and an address to the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance. Even in Seoul, which is 6,885 miles from New York, Mr. Liu was asked about his possible candidacy for mayor. “I can’t believe I am in Seoul and people are still asking me that question,” he said at one point. At a 7-Eleven outside the university after his speech, Mr. Liu acknowledged that he had given the idea some thought. “People say that I would be a different kind of mayor,” he said, after buying a bottle of Korean corn tea and a pack of dried squid. “I think it would be obvious why.” Su Hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and David W. Chen from New York. Title:","response":"\\"NYC Comptroller John Liu Seeks Asian Support Amid Mayoral Ambitions and Federal Investigation\\""},{"question":"A text is given in Panjabi.

Building a treehouse involves understanding various physical objects, their properties, and how they interact with one another to create a safe, secure, and enjoyable structure. Here's a detailed description of this task, as well as the physical objects involved: 1. Site Selection: The first step is to identify a suitable tree or group of trees sturdy enough to support the treehouse. The trees chosen must be healthy, with robust, well-anchored root systems, strong branches, and sufficient height and space to ensure the safety and comfort of the occupants. 2. Design: Once a suitable tree or trees have been identified, a design for the treehouse must be created based on the location, available materials, and desired features. Elements like the size, shape, entry and exit points, windows, and whether to include multiple levels should be considered, as well as the desired aesthetics and any local building regulations that may apply. 3. Materials: A treehouse is typically built using several kinds of physical objects: a. Lumber: Wood is the primary material used for constructing the treehouse. This includes pressure-treated lumber for the support beams and framing, as well as plywood or planking for the flooring, walls, and roofing. The size and thickness of wood members will be determined by the design and the load-bearing capacity required. b. Fasteners: Various types of fasteners are needed to hold the wood components together securely. These include screws, nails, bolts, and specialized treehouse-specific hardware such as tree attachment bolts (TABs) that allow for tree growth without damaging the structure. c. Brackets and Supports: Metal brackets, hinges, and supports provide additional strength and stability to joints and load-bearing points. This hardware should be corrosion-resistant to ensure longevity and safety. d. Roofing Material: The treehouse may be protected from the elements with a roof made from materials such as asphalt shingles, metal roofing sheets, or wooden shakes. The choice will depend on the desired appearance, weather conditions, and budget constraints. e. Insulation and Cladding: Depending on weather and intended usage, insulation may be necessary to provide thermal comfort. External cladding or siding materials like wood, vinyl, or fiber cement can protect the treehouse from the elements and give it visual appeal. f. Windows and Doors: Proper openings allowing for ventilation, light, and entry/exit are essential. These should be fitted with secure and well-sealed windows and doors to shield the occupants from the elements and maintain safety and privacy. 4. Construction: With a design in place and the appropriate materials procured, the construction process can begin: a. Foundation and Support: Erect the primary support beams and brackets to the selected tree or trees, ensuring a strong, stable, and level foundation. This might involve drilling into the tree to attach TABs or using braces and supports surrounding the tree. b. Framing and Flooring: Construct the floor framing and attach it to the foundation; then install the floor decking material. c. Walls and Roof: Once the flooring is complete, frame the walls, integrate windows and doors as required, and then attach them to the floor structure. Next, install the roof trusses followed by the roofing material. d. Finishing Touches: Finally, apply any insulation, siding, or cladding materials to the exterior and install the windows and doors. Customizations such as railings, built-in seating, or a ladder or stairway can be added to enhance the treehouse experience. Throughout the construction process, attention must be paid to the properties and characteristics of various physical objects used, ensuring they are selected and applied appropriately for the intended function, durability, and safety of the treehouse."},{"question":"Given the question: Terry and Jake are currently at a dinner party of a mutual friend. They are having a conversation while enjoying a glass of wine when suddenly on the TV there is a commercial about a new disease. This prompts Terry to mention that he actually has sickle cell anemia.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who has blood cells that struggle to pass through small blood vessels? Hint: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels.

Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: \\"We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.\\" By the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. \\"Throw Away Your Television,\\" while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus.

Here's a question that has a factual answer: Question: What is the significance of the Turing Test in the field of artificial intelligence? Answer: The Turing Test, introduced by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, is an essential concept in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The test was proposed in Turing's seminal paper, \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\\" in which he addressed the question, \\"Can machines think?\\" The Turing Test is an evaluation of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior, indistinguishable from that of a human. In the test, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a machine and a human without knowing which is which. If the judge is unable to reliably distinguish between the machine's responses and those of the human, the machine is said to have passed the test, demonstrating human-like intelligence. The significance of the Turing Test lies in its role as a benchmark for determining the progress of AI research. It serves as a thought experiment that sets a goalpost for AI developers, challenging them to create more advanced and sophisticated algorithms. As AI technologies have continued to advance, researchers have developed more specific versions of the Turing Test, focusing on tasks such as understanding natural language, playing games, and generating art and music. While passing the Turing Test is not the sole determining factor of whether a machine is truly intelligent, it remains an important milestone in the ongoing development of artificial intelligence."},{"question":"Do these mean the same?

This is the only story of Albert Campion that is told by Campion in the first person .","response":"Imagine you have a friend named Albert Campion who likes to tell stories about champions. Sometimes, he pretends he is the champion in the story, and sometimes he tells the story like he is watching it from the outside. The second sentence means Albert Campion has many stories, but there is only one story where he pretends he is the champion in the story. It's like he is the superhero in just one of his tales! The first sentence is a little confusing, but it seems to say that this is the first story Albert Campion tells about a champion where he pretends to be the champion. However, the way it is written makes it hard to understand exactly what it means.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other as they convey different information regarding the relationship between the Jieț River and the Slivei River in Romania. 1. The first sentence states that the Jieț River is a tributary of the Slivei River in Romania. This implies that the Jieț River flows into and joins the Slivei River, and therefore, the Slivei River is the main river in this scenario. 2. The second sentence, on the other hand, states that the Slivei River is a tributary of the Jieț River in Romania. This implies that the Slivei River flows into and joins the Jieț River, and therefore, the Jieț River is the main river in this scenario. The primary difference between these two sentences is the relationship between the two rivers. In the first sentence, the Jieț River is a smaller river that flows into the larger Slivei River, while in the second sentence, the Slivei River is the smaller river that flows into the larger Jieț River.

The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure from the Russian nobility to break off the alliance.

Question: What does Casey need to do before this? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: change out of his soiled clothes B: change clothes into something appropriate C: pregame with wine coolers Answer:","response":"B: change clothes into something appropriate Before attending the wine tasting, Casey needs to change into appropriate attire for formal dining. This typically involves wearing more elegant, sophisticated clothing that is suitable for high-class, upscale events such as a wine tasting. In this context, it's important for Casey to dress well to show respect for the event and its attendees, as well as to feel comfortable and confident in the company of others who will also be dressed formally. Answer A doesn't provide enough context to establish that Casey's clothes are soiled and need changing. Furthermore, it might not imply that Casey needs to change into formal dining clothes, as they could instead be changing into other casual or semi-casual clothing that would not be appropriate for a wine tasting event. Answer C suggests that Casey should pregame with wine coolers, which is not an appropriate step to take before attending a wine tasting. Pregaming with alcohol can impair judgment and reduce the ability to fully appreciate and enjoy the experience of tasting and savoring different wines at the event. It's important for attendees to arrive sober and with a clear palate to ensure they can fully engage in the wine tasting process and learn about the various wine offerings."},{"question":"Premise: Studies suggest that physicians can opportunistically capitalize on the motivating effects of acute injuries or medical conditions that require emergency care to convince patients of the need for behavior change. Hypothesis: Being injured is highly motivating for people to begin exercise. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis that \\"Being injured is highly motivating for people to begin exercise\\" is not directly entailed by the premise. The premise focuses on physicians capitalizing on the motivating effects of acute injuries or medical conditions that require emergency care to convince patients of the need for behavior change. The behavior change in question could involve various aspects, not necessarily limited to exercise, such as dietary habits, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol intake, or managing stress. However, the premise does provide some support to the hypothesis, as it implies that patients might be more likely to consider and accept the need for behavior change, possibly including exercise, when they are faced with an acute injury or medical condition that places them in an emergency care situation. In these circumstances, patients may be more receptive to medical advice and more concerned about their long-term health outcomes. Thus, the motivating effect of a medical emergency could potentially inspire a patient to start exercising. Still, exercise as a specific behavior change is not explicitly mentioned in the premise, and the motivation for patients to start exercising after facing an injury could also depend on other factors. For instance, the severity of their injury, their pre-existing beliefs about exercise, and their overall mental and physical readiness may all play a role in their decision-making process. Additionally, the hypothesis seems to be focused on the patients, while the premise concentrates more on the physicians' actions to convince patients to change their behavior. Thus, although the premise might suggest that acute injuries or medical emergencies can be catalysts for motivation, it does not directly entail the hypothesis that being injured is highly motivating for people to begin exercise."},{"question":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: A super ball is a popular what that children enjoy? Possible A: toy, park, earball, play with, bounces Why is \\"toy\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"toy\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it fits the context and meaning of the question, considering the experiences and knowledge that humans acquire through everyday life. First, the question mentions \\"a super ball,\\" which is a specific object. This object is known to be small, made of rubber or a similar material, and is capable of bouncing with great energy. The description already suggests that it is a tangible item, which narrows down the possible options among the given answers. Among the given answers, \\"park,\\" \\"earball,\\" and \\"play with\\" can be ruled out using common sense. \\"Park\\" is a location, not an object that children enjoy. \\"Earball\\" is not a known term in the context of popular things children enjoy, making it nonsensical and irrelevant. \\"Play with\\" is a verb phrase, which doesn't fit with the structure of the question as it asks for a noun to complete the sentence. The answer \\"bounces\\" could be considered but is less appropriate as it describes the action or property of the object, rather than an overarching category to which the item belongs. This leaves \\"toy\\" as the most suitable answer, and it aligns with human common sense. A \\"toy\\" is an object designed for children's play and entertainment. The super ball, being a small rubber ball that bounces with great energy, provides amusement and can be used in various play activities, making it a popular toy among children. Humans commonly associate toys with children's enjoyment, and referring to a super ball as a \\"toy\\" is something that is readily understood. Moreover, super balls have been a popular type of toy for decades. They were invented in the 1960s and gained widespread fame for their ability to bounce much higher than regular balls, inciting fascination and fun among children. These historical and cultural contexts also reinforce the common sense association between a super ball and the category of toys. In conclusion, \\"toy\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it fits the context and meaning of the question, considering the experiences and knowledge that humans acquire through everyday life. \\"Toy\\" accurately represents the category to which a super ball belongs, given its purpose, function, and cultural significance in children's entertainment."},{"question":"tags for this image: abbess, basel, feyerabend, woman Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"Tags for this image: Abbess, Basel, Feyerabend, Woman The image appears to be related to an Abbess, possibly the head of a religious community in Basel. The name Feyerabend could refer to a significant figure or event in that community. Lastly, the image prominently features a woman, who could be the Abbess or another prominent figure within the Basel community. The term \\"Abbess\\" relates to a female superior or head of an abbey of nuns. Typically, an Abbess is responsible for managing the convent or monastery, as well as the spiritual well-being of the community members under her care. She may also be responsible for overseeing the education, health care, and welfare of the people in surrounding areas. Basel is a city in northwestern Switzerland, situated near the borders with France and Germany. With a rich history in arts, culture, and scholarship, Basel boasts of many historically significant buildings, including monasteries, churches, and convents. In earlier times, religious institutions played a central role in the city's community life, as well as in preserving cultural heritage. It would not be surprising if the image were related to one of the many religious institutions in Basel, specifically an abbey or convent led by an Abbess. The name \\"Feyerabend\\" could refer to a prominent individual or event within that religious community. Feyerabend may be the surname of a historical figure associated with the abbey or convent, or it may represent a significant event that occurred within the institution during the time of the Abbess' tenure. Regarding the \\"Woman\\" tag, the female figure prominently featured in the image could be the Abbess herself or another important female member of the religious community. It is important to recognize the role of women in religious institutions, as they were key players in the development and preservation of cultural, intellectual, and spiritual traditions. Women played diverse roles in religious institutions, such as teaching, writing, and executing key roles in the institutions' administration. Thus, the inclusion of a woman as a central figure in the image underlines the significance and contributions of women in Basel's religious and cultural history. In conclusion, the image with tags Abbess, Basel, Feyerabend, and Woman possibly represents an historical and cultural artifact related to a religious community in Basel, led by an Abbess. The woman depicted in the image could be the Abbess or another influential female figure within the community, and the name \\"Feyerabend\\" may be related to a significant individual or event associated with that abbey or convent. As an AI, I am unable to view the actual image, but through an interpretation of the tags, a vivid picture of Basel's rich religious history can be reconstructed."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. Premise: \\"One dog sniffs another lying on the ground.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A dog is moving towards another dog.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that \\"One dog sniffs another lying on the ground.\\" From this information, we know that there are two dogs: one that is sniffing and another that is lying on the ground. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"A dog is moving towards another dog.\\" This statement suggests that one dog is approaching another dog in some fashion. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Now we need to compare the information provided in the premise against the information in the hypothesis to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Step 4: Identify key actions In the premise, the key action is that one dog is sniffing another dog, which is lying on the ground. In the hypothesis, the key action is that a dog is moving towards another dog. Step 5: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis To sniff another dog, it is reasonable to assume that the sniffing dog had to move towards the other dog in order to get close enough to perform the action. Therefore, the action of moving towards another dog is implied by the action of sniffing another dog. Step 6: Conclusion Based on this step-by-step reasoning, we can conclude that the premise (\\"One dog sniffs another lying on the ground.\\") does entail the hypothesis (\\"A dog is moving towards another dog.\\") because for the sniffing action to occur, the dog likely had to approach the other dog."},{"question":"Context: QB Joey Harrington had 414 yards off a record 62 attempts (33 of them were complete), but he also threw 3 INT's (one returned for a TD).

(CNN) -- Forecasters are expecting warmer than normal temperatures and gusty winds Tuesday in a northern Colorado area already ravaged by a wildfire, not a good combination for the legion of firefighters trying to extinguish the blaze. The High Park Fire had consumed more than 58,700 acres of woodland by Monday evening, but it was about 50% contained, authorities reported. Tuesday's forecast by the National Weather Service is similar to Monday's blazing heat and winds that whipped up the blaze. But firefighters say they can handle the weather conditions because winds are expected to be less \\"tough\\" than what they experienced on Sunday. iReport: Photos capture smoke choking Colorado sky \\"The expected winds were not as strong as they were. The amount of fire activity in the big timber on the western perimeter was not as extreme,\\" fire information officer Brett Haberstick said, according to CNN affiliate KCNC. \\"We have a lot less smoke and a lot better working conditions for the crews.\\" More than 1,700 personnel were battling the blaze. Lighting ignited the fire that started on June 9 and has destroyed 189 homes. That number is expected to grow, and firefighters are also concerned that the blaze could shift toward dense stands of trees that have been killed by beetle infestations, according to InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed the life of a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling a fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze, also blamed on lightning, had grown to more than 13,000 acres by Monday night and was 30% contained. And a new fire broke out Sunday and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy Fire has scorched more than 296,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said. More than 3,200 fire personnel from across the United States are helping local departments battle the fire, which began on May 16. The blaze was 82% contained as of Monday. In North Carolina, a wildfire doubled overnight in the Croatan National Forest along the Atlantic coast, U.S. Forest Service officials said Tuesday.

It highlights the challenges firefighters face due to unfavorable weather conditions, such as warmer temperatures and gusty winds, which exacerbate the fires. The High Park Fire, which had engulfed over 58,700 acres of woodland, was 50% contained at the time of the article. The National Weather Service forecasted similar blazing heat and winds for the following days, although firefighters expressed confidence in handling these conditions due to the winds being less intense than what they experienced earlier on in the battle. Over 1,700 personnel were working to extinguish the fire, which had been ignited by lightning and had destroyed 189 homes so far. Firefighters were concerned that the fire could shift toward dense stands of trees killed by beetle infestations. The High Park Fire had caused thousands of evacuations, destroyed neighborhoods, and had resulted in the death of a 62-year-old woman. Additionally, firefighters in Colorado were fighting a fire near Pagosa Springs, which had grown to over 13,000 acres. Another fire had broken out near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy Fire had consumed over 296,000 acres with over 3,200 personnel from across the United States helping local departments. Lastly, the article also mentions a wildfire in North Carolina's Croatan National Forest, which had consumed 21,248 acres and was 20% contained, though not posing a threat to structures."},{"question":"Very surprised how good this place is, menudo and birria severed everyday instead of just Sundays like most restaurants, the birria was excellent .

At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.\\" Answer: A:","response":"Government support for Buddhism and other aspects in Asia varies significantly across different countries and regions. However, there are several key areas where government support is provided to religious institutions, cultural preservation, social welfare, and economic development. 1. Support for religious institutions: In many Asian countries, Buddhism plays a significant role in shaping the cultural and social identities of the population. Governments often support Buddhist institutions in various ways, such as financial assistance, land allocation, and infrastructure development. The governments of Cambodia and Bhutan, for example, recognize Buddhism as their state religion and actively support Buddhist monasteries, pagodas, and educational institutions. Moreover, in countries like Thailand, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, governments also provide financial assistance and other support to Buddhist institutions. 2. Cultural preservation: Governments across Asia recognize the importance of preserving and promoting their cultural heritage. This often includes the protection and restoration of ancient Buddhist sites, artifacts, and texts. In countries such as India, China, and Japan, government authorities collaborate with international organizations and local communities to preserve and maintain important Buddhist heritage sites, such as the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in India, the Mogao Grottoes in China, and the ancient Buddhist temples in Japan. 3. Social welfare: Asian governments often support Buddhist organizations and charities in social welfare programs to improve the lives of people in need. These programs may include healthcare and education services, disaster relief efforts, and poverty alleviation initiatives. Buddhist organizations, such as Tzu Chi Foundation in Taiwan or the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement in Sri Lanka, often work closely with government agencies to provide essential services to underprivileged individuals and communities. 4. Economic development: Some Asian governments seek to promote economic development by supporting Buddhist tourism and other industries associated with Buddhism. The encouragement of Buddhist pilgrimage sites, cultural events, and tourism infrastructures can help attract tourists, create jobs, and generate income for the local population. Countries, like Nepal and China, actively promote the Buddhist circuit, which includes sites associated with the life of the Buddha and other key locations of Buddhist history. 5. Educational support: Buddhist schools and universities in some Asian nations receive extensive support from governments. This support includes funding for educational infrastructure, teacher training, and scholarships for students. Furthermore, in certain countries, the governments work to incorporate Buddhist teachings and practices into the national curriculum, ensuring the transmission of knowledge and values to future generations. In conclusion, government support for Buddhism in Asia manifests in various ways, including support for religious institutions, cultural preservation, social welfare, economic development, and education. This support not only highlights the significant role Buddhism plays in shaping the cultural, social, and political landscape of these countries but also reveals the dynamic nature of Buddhism as it continues to adapt and thrive in the modern world."},{"question":"Bordered on three sides by Senegal and with a small coast on the Atlantic Ocean in the west, what is the smallest country on mainland Africa?

It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to.

He undertook army training at Aurangabad. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Hazare was posted at the border in the Khem Karan sector. He was the sole survivor of an enemy attack--variously claimed to have been a bomb, an aerial assault and an exchange of fire at the border--while he was driving a truck. The experiences of wartime, coupled with the poverty from which he had come, affected him. He considered suicide at one point but turned instead to pondering the meaning of life and death. He said of the truck attack, \\"[It] sent me thinking. I felt that God wanted me to stay alive for some reason. I was reborn in the battlefield of Khem Karan.

It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - Air chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl or ACM) is a four-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force, where it is the most senior peacetime air force rank. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries that have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air chief marshal is a four-star air officer rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-9. An air chief marshal is equivalent to an admiral in the Royal Navy or a General in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent four-star rank is General. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. What entity does 'david evans ' has the relation 'conflict' with? The answer is:","response":"Air Chief Marshal Sir David George Evans has a relation with the 'conflict' through his association with the Royal Air Force (RAF). Although detailed information about his specific involvement in conflicts is not provided, it can be inferred that he was connected to conflicts in which the RAF participated, given his senior role as a commander in the organization. The RAF, as the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force, has had a significant role in various conflicts in British military history, particularly during the Second World War. Its most famous campaign during this time was the Battle of Britain, a critical combat of the war. In this battle, the RAF defended the United Kingdom against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks between June and October 1940. As Air Chief Marshal, a four-star air officer rank, Sir David George Evans would have held a high level of responsibility within the RAF, and therefore, be associated with conflicts in which the organization took part. The RAF played a decisive role in many military engagements throughout its history, involving planning, support, and direct combat operations. These experiences and the conflicts in which the RAF participated are the entities that Sir David Evans is related to through his career in the armed forces."},{"question":"Summarize this article: A painting at a National Trust for Scotland property in Aberdeenshire is probably by famous Italian artist Raphael, experts have said. The Virgin Mary, at Haddo House, Methlick, was investigated at part of BBC Four's Britain's Lost Masterpieces. It was acquired by George Hamilton-Gordon, the 4th Earl of Aberdeen and Prime Minister between 1852 and 1855. Art experts Dr Bendor Grosvenor said: \\"Finding a possible Raphael is about as exciting as it gets.\\" Raphael - Raffaello Santi, who was born in 1483 - was considered the supreme painter of the High Renaissance era. His work also extended to architecture and design. The Virgin Mary was bought as a genuine Raphael, but it was later attributed to Innocenzo da Imola. 'Beautiful picture' It was removed, cleaned and subjected to detailed investigation. Dr Grosvenor said: \\"This is a beautiful picture that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. \\"I hope 'the Haddo Madonna', which would be Scotland's only publicly owned Raphael, brings many people to this part of Aberdeenshire.\\" Jennifer Melville, head of collections, archives and libraries at the National Trust for Scotland said: \\"The National Trust for Scotland holds so many treasures all over the country. We always knew that the collection at Haddo was very special, and the discovery of these wonderful pieces confirms its importance in the Scottish art world. \\"It is rare for visitors to see works of this quality outwith a gallery, so it is a real treat to come to Haddo House and enjoy them in this wonderful setting. \\"This is particularly exciting for the piece which looks likely to be by Raphael. There are not many places where you can experience the work of one of the Renaissance's giants in a dining room. It is this intimacy which makes exploring our collections quite so special.\\" Britain's Lost Masterpieces airs on Wednesday at 21:00. ||||| The National Trust for Scotland has discovered in one of its stately homes a painting that art historians believe is likely to be a work by the Italian renaissance artist Raphael. The painting, a Madonna composition, had been obscured by discoloured varnish and was attributed to a minor hand. Its potential as a work of one of the giants of art history, as revered as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, was initially spotted by the historian Bendor Grosvenor. The picture has been dated to between 1505 and 1510. By 1899 its valuation as a copy was just £20 – equivalent to about £2,000 in present-day prices. As a Raphael, its value on today’s market would be around £20m. Grosvenor was visiting Haddo House, the National Trust’s 18th-century stately home in Aberdeenshire, to examine some other paintings for a new BBC series when he was struck by a picture tucked away in a corner, high up over a door. The light was poor and its details were difficult to discern. Yet, he recalled: “I thought, crikey, it looks like a Raphael … It was very dirty under old varnish, which goes yellow … Being an anorak, I go round houses like this with binoculars and torches. If I hadn’t done that, I’d probably have walked past it.” He discovered that the picture had been bought as a Raphael in the early 19th century and exhibited as such in 1841 at the British Institution in London, alongside other Raphaels that are still accepted as genuine. But it was soon afterwards downgraded to “after Raphael”, suggesting a copy by another artist, and it was eventually attributed to a minor Renaissance artist, Innocenzo Francucci da Imola. “It is simply too good to be by Innocenzo,” Grosvenor said. He persuaded the National Trust to allow him to have it conserved. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jacky Klein and Bendor Grosvenor with the painting. Photograph: Andrew Staite/BBC/Tern Television The removal of many layers of dirt and varnish revealed what he described as “a work of extreme beauty” with a “breathtaking” quality. “You stand there and wonder, how did he do that, which you do with all great painters,” he said. His subsequent research uncovered important evidence such as underdrawing “which fitted the bill”, he said. An alteration in one of the fingers “suggests original creative intervention, meaning the picture cannot be a copy of another known work”. The drawing of the face, and the model used, were recognisably Raphaelesque, he observed, pointing out that the same profile appeared in other Raphael Madonnas. A photograph of a now-lost Raphael drawing also matched its basic outlines “very closely”. The story of the discovery will be told on 5 October in a new BBC4 series, Britain’s Lost Masterpieces, co-presented by Grosvenor and the art historian Jacky Klein. In the programme, Sir Nicholas Penny, former director of the National Gallery, describes the Haddo painting as “very beautiful”. On his attributional scale of “perhaps, probably or by” a particular artist, he declares: “I’m between probably and by. I just want a bit more time and courage.” Italian Camorra inquiry recovers Van Goghs 14 years after infamous heist Read more Grosvenor, who is also a presenter on BBC1’s Fake or Fortune series, said: “We had to turn this series round in very quick order. We didn’t have time or resources to take it on a European tour of Raphael scholars.” But he added that “all the evidence seems to point in the right direction … It would be Scotland’s only publicly owned Raphael.” Haddo House was home to the earls and marquesses of Aberdeen, the most famous of whom was the 4th earl, George Gordon, a 19th-century prime minister. The house and its contents – including this picture - were given to the National Trust for Scotland in 1976. Grosvenor said: “In the film, we talk to the current Lord Aberdeen about the fate of the family picture collection. He acutely observed that if it hadn’t been downgraded … it would have been sold long ago and it wouldn’t have been in the house today.” The painting is attributed to Innocenzo on the website of Art UK, which has recorded 200,000 oil paintings in the UK’s public collections. The site was the starting point for Grosvenor’s BBC series – “wading through thousands of pictures” in search of lost masterpieces. The public can see the painting in Haddo House’s dining room, where it has been given pride of place. |||||","response":"A painting at the National Trust for Scotland's Haddo House in Aberdeenshire is believed to be by the famous Italian artist Raphael.

Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"This term refers to Demineralized Water, wherein all minerals and salts have been thoroughly removed. The purpose behind this process is to prevent any detrimental effects on the internal components of several devices, including steam turbines, boilers, and heat pipes. Demineralized Water is a specific type of purified water that has had most, if not all, of its mineral and salt ions removed. These mainly include cations such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, as well as anions like chloride, nitrate, and sulfate. The process of demineralization entails the use of an ion exchange process, wherein unwanted ions are replaced with hydrogen and hydroxyl in water, which then combine to form pure water. Steam turbines, boilers, and heat pipes are specifically designed to function with water; however, they are highly sensitive to impurities within the water source. For instance, minerals and salts, if left unchecked, can lead to the formation of deposits in these systems. These deposits if left untreated, can cause significant inefficiencies and eventually breakdown of these devices, which could result in costly repairs and downtime. Hence, to avoid this, Demineralized Water is used. In standard practice, demineralized water used in such systems is often treated even further to remove any trace gases and micro-biological impurities. This extreme level of purification not only drastically reduces wear and tear of the internal parts but also significantly improves the efficiency and longevity of steam turbines, boilers, and heat pipes. In conclusion, Demineralized Water plays a critical role in ensuring the optimal performance of devices such as steam turbines, boilers, and heat pipes. It is a disciplined effort to minimize potential damage and operational failures within these systems. The continued use of demineralized water in these systems promotes their effective functionality over a long period, ensuring sustained productivity and cost efficiency in the long run."},{"question":"– More than 10 million Facebook users are fans of Lady Gaga, making her the first living person to reach the eight-digit reaches of global popularity, Us reports.

He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach.

In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother.

Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen , a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure below ). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. Q: Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of what, resulting in a signal for a phagocyte to destroy them? A: A:","response":"Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen, resulting in a signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. This binding occurs due to the unique complementary structure between the antibody and the antigen, which fits together like a lock and key. Antigens are proteins recognized as foreign and are found on the surfaces of bacteria, viruses, and other foreign microorganisms. When an antibody binds to its specific antigen, it triggers a process called phagocytosis, in which phagocytes, a type of white blood cell, engulf and destroy the targeted antigen along with the pathogen it is attached to.

But all I can do is just wait,\\" said Sudsakorn Sudtham, 35, whose son, Prajak, is 14. The parents of the missing boys have been at the site near Chiang Rai since Saturday. The group, all belonging to the same soccer team from the nearby city of Chiang Rai, have been missing since 1 p.m. Saturday when a park officer spotted something amiss -- bicycles parked idly by the entrance to the cave despite it being off-limits. They are believed to have crawled into the large series of caves through a narrow, 15-meter-long (50-foot) channel. Another anxious parent, Pinyo Bhodhi, 37, said he became worried when his son, Pipat, 15, hadn't returned home Saturday evening -- the day before his birthday. He told CNN he'd arranged a party and a cake for Pipat, a keen soccer player who \\"trains every day\\" and has dreams of being on the Thai national team, on Saturday night. When Pipat failed to come home, his father started calling around to his son's friends, teammates and coaches. \\"It was already 7 (or) 8 p.m. and he hadn't returned home, (so) I started to look for him.\\" Soccer shoes are left next to bikes from the missing boys at the entrance of a cave in northern Thailand.

Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"1. We start by understanding the context of the provided information. George doesn't have a car, which implies he uses some other mode of transportation or mobility. 2. The statement mentions George's \\"two feet,\\" which suggests that the mode of transportation involves using his feet. 3. It's mentioned that his socks are smelly, and his soles are blistered. This indicates that he has been using his feet extensively, most likely for walking. The presence of blisters also supports the idea of significant walking activity. 4. Now, let's analyze the options given: - Michigan: This option is irrelevant to the context, as it's a geographical location. - Walk: Based on the context and information about George's feet, this seems to be the most relevant and logical choice. - Stay still: This doesn't align with the described condition of George's feet, indicating that he has been active. - Stink: This is related to the smelly socks mentioned, but it doesn't answer the question of what George could still do. - Hands: This option is unrelated to the context, as the focus is on George's feet and not his hands. 5. Based on the analysis, the most appropriate and logical option is \\"walk\\".

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.

The Czech language is closely related to Slovak and partially intelligible with Polish and other Slavic languages. Here is an English translation of the sentence: \\"I saw him on Sunday, and he looked quite sad.\\" The sentence structure, as well as the diacritical marks like the acute accents (e.g., ě), are characteristic features of the Czech language. Czech has a rich inflectional system, which means that its nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers, and verbs change their forms according to their role in a sentence (e.g., subject, object, or possessive). This allows for greater flexibility when it comes to word order, although the basic word order is subject-verb-object (SVO), just like in English. Czech also makes use of a particular set of consonants, called rhotic consonants. These include sounds represented by the letters 'r' and 'ř'. The latter (ř) is unique to Czech and is also known as a \\"voiced alveolar fricative trill.\\" It may be challenging for non-native speakers to pronounce it accurately. Additionally, the Czech language has seven cases in its grammar system: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. These cases indicate the function of a noun, pronoun, or adjective within a sentence, affecting the endings of the words. Understanding and using these cases correctly may also require practice and learning for non-native speakers. The Czech language has a rich literary tradition that goes back centuries, with several noteworthy authors, poets, and playwrights contributing to its cultural heritage.

Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones.

He is the fastest bowler ever in the history of cricket, who delivered the fastest delivery officially recorded at a top speed of 161.3 km/h in a pool match against England in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Akhtar was nicknamed as \\"Rawalpindi Express\\" & \\"Tiger\\", as a tribute to his hometown and fast bowling. He is the first bowler to break the 100 mph barrier as well, which he did twice in his career. Akhtar made a return to international cricket albeit in the shorter format of the game. In May 2010, PCB named him in a list of 35 probables for the Asia Cup. On 15 June 2010, Akhtar made his return, taking 3 wickets for 28 runs in the first match of the Asia Cup against Sri Lanka. He narrowly missed out a spot in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in place of the injured Umar Gul. In July 2010, he was selected for the Twenty20 series against Australia but the selectors decided not to play him in the Test squad so that he would not get injured. He was subsequently selected for the ODI and Twenty20 series against England in September 2010. Akhtar returned to the national side representing the country against England in the Twenty20 International. He bowled an impressive spell and returned with figures of 2 wickets for 23 runs. He continued to bowl well in the ODI series in the absence of regular fast-bowlers, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir, who were suspended by the International Cricket Council amid allegations of Spot-fixing. Despite his relatively good bowling form, Pakistani coach Waqar Younis insisted that the bowling attack must not become reliant on Akhtar, as he is 35 years of age and fitness troubles continue to affect him. Akhtar was selected for the tour of New Zealand and started his campaign off well with 3 wickets on Boxing Day in the first of two Twenty20 Internationals against New Zealand. Akhtar was selected in Pakistan's 15-man squad to play in the 2011 World Cup hosted by Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka in February to March. During the tournament, he announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. He was dropped from the squad after group matches and was not included in the quarter final either. In September, Akhtar released his autobiography, Controversially Yours.

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"The report by Mr. Rovsing is important as it deals with innovations in the member countries of the EU. The significance of Mr. Rovsing's report lies in its coverage of innovation within the European Union's member countries. As the European Union (EU) consists of 27 diverse nations, each with its own unique economy, culture, and resources, fostering innovation across these countries has become a crucial aspect of enhancing economic growth, increasing competitiveness, and nurturing social development. Innovation is recognized as a key driver of economic growth and overall well-being. It is widely understood as the development and successful implementation of new ideas, processes, or products that contribute to increased productivity and sustainability, as well as offering solutions to global challenges such as climate change, healthcare, and social inequality. Within the EU context, innovation is at the core of the European Union's policies and strategies, including the Europe 2020 Strategy, which aims to transform the EU into a more inclusive and sustainable knowledge-based economy. Mr. Rovsing's report sheds light on the importance of innovation in enhancing the EU's competitiveness in the global market. By examining the current innovations across various sectors and industries, the report seeks to identify successful strategies and initiatives that can be replicated or adapted to boost innovation in other member countries. These insights help policymakers to better understand the current state of innovation in the EU and to identify opportunities for further improvement. Moreover, the report highlights the role of regional and national policies in fostering a supportive environment for innovation. By acknowledging that innovation thrives best in an environment where flexible and adaptive regulatory frameworks, access to funding, and collaboration between public and private sector actors are actively encouraged, the report underscores the importance of harmonizing EU member countries' approaches to regulating and promoting innovation. Lastly, Mr. Rovsing's report serves as a reminder that innovation is not only about technological or economic advancements but also about finding new ways to address social and environmental challenges. Developing sustainable and inclusive solutions that benefit all citizens of the EU requires a strong emphasis on innovation across several dimensions, such as the green and digital transformations the EU is currently pursuing. In summary, the report by Mr. Rovsing is vital as it deliberates on innovations in the EU member countries, emphasizing the role of innovation in driving economic growth, increasing competitiveness, and solving pressing global challenges. By shedding light on the current state of innovation and the factors that contribute to its success in various EU member states, the report offers valuable insights and recommendations that can inform future policy decisions and support a stronger, more sustainable, and more inclusive European Union."},{"question":"Тем не менее, даже внутри Нового Завета существует некоторая напряженность. Translate to English","response":"Nevertheless, even within the New Testament there exists a certain tension. This tension within the New Testament can be attributed to many factors which include varying interpretations, context, and differences between the four gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - as well as differing viewpoints from other writings within the New Testament such as Paul's letters and the Book of Revelation. These varied interpretations can be attributed to the fact that the New Testament is composed of multiple accounts by different authors written over a considerable time period, all with their own unique perspectives on events and teachings. Additionally, many of these texts were written decades after the events they describe, which can lead to natural discrepancies in memory and the passing down of stories. The context, too, plays an essential role in the underlying tension. The New Testament was written in a time when early Christianity was experiencing persecution and external threats from various socio-political forces. As a result, the authors often had to tailor their messages to their specific audiences, which could contribute to contrasting views and interpretations within the text. Examining the individual differences between the four gospels, it becomes apparent that each writer had a unique perspective on the life of Jesus. For example, Mark's gospel is generally considered the most somber and focuses on the humanity and suffering of Jesus. In contrast, John's gospel emphasizes the divinity of Jesus and His pre-existence before His incarnation as a human being. These varying perspectives contribute to different understandings and portrayals of Jesus, His teachings, and His mission, ultimately leading to an inherent tension within the New Testament. Additionally, the letters written by Paul and other apostolic figures in the New Testament often address specific concerns and matters within the various early Christian communities. Different communities faced unique problems, and the advice and counsel given in these letters can sometimes appear to conflict with other parts of the New Testament. It is essential to understand that these texts were often written to address specific issues and not meant as a comprehensive ethical or doctrinal guide. Finally, the Book of Revelation presents an apocalyptic vision of the end times and the ultimate establishment of God's kingdom on earth. The highly symbolic and cryptic nature of this text has led to countless interpretations and debates among scholars and theologians, which further adds to the tension within the New Testament. In conclusion, the tension within the New Testament is a natural consequence of the text's composition, comprising different accounts by different authors, and the various contexts and circumstances in which these texts were written. Understanding and appreciating these inherent tensions can provide a rich, multifaceted understanding of early Christianity and its sacred scriptures."},{"question":"Is it true that can a set be an element of another set based on the following text?

The information given does not directly imply anything about what these women will do after the event or the reasons for their attendance. However, it is possible to infer that the women might disperse and return to their respective activities or jobs after the event. Still, this is an assumption and not a logical conclusion based solely on the initial statement. Multiple scenarios could take place after the event: 1. The women might disperse to go back to work if the event is during their work hours or if they have work-related commitments afterward. 2. They could continue with other social activities or gatherings related to the initial event, such as networking or further discussions. 3. The women could attend another event or conference, which could be either related or unrelated to the initial gathering. 4. They might go back home or to other personal engagements after the event. 5. The women might simply remain at the event location to continue discussions or spend some leisure time. In summary, the statement \\"Many women have gathered and are listening to speakers\\" does not logically or necessarily lead to the conclusion that \\"Women disperse to go back to work.\\" While it is possible for the women to return to work after the event, it cannot be determined as a logical consequence based on the information available.

By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds.

To help keep the wound moist, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly on it. Doing this helps promote healing, reduce scabbing, and reduce scarring. You can apply the petroleum jelly with clean fingers or a cotton swab. If your wound is large enough and still has open sections, you may want to cover it with gauze. Place gauze over the open area and tape it in place with paper tape. After it has started to heal, you can leave it uncovered. Talk to your doctor about whether or not you should cover the area with gauze.

Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a frozen lake in a sub-zero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler's indecision quickly imperils him when he runs into a traveling wolf pack until he is rescued by a travelling elderly Inuit native named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who builds a shelter for him.Alone, Tyler's days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly dispelling their mutual fears.

Benjamin Bomfleur and his colleagues spotted the sperm fragments when they used an electron microscope to examine the inner surface of the cocoon fossil, which had been collected by an Argentinian expedition on Seymour Island, which lies off the Antarctic Peninsula. Their findings are published today in Biology Letters1. Because of their delicate nature, sperm cells are very rarely found in fossils. The previous oldest animal sperm was from springtails preserved in Baltic amber, about 40 million years old2. (Plant sperm fossils go back further, to 400-million-year-old specimens from early land plants in Scotland3.) Surprising discovery Bomfleur says that the discovery was a surprise — “we laughed”, he says, on seeing the microscope images — “but in retrospect, it makes sense that you would find them as common inclusions in fossil cocoons”. The cocoons are secreted by some worms, including earthworms and leeches, which deposit sperm and eggs inside. Each cocoon then hardens to form a protective case for the developing embryos. The researchers do not know what kind of worm left the sperm. Scanning electron microscope images show helical structures resembling drill-bits and beaded tails, which are characteristic of sperm produced by crayfish worms, leech-like creatures that live on freshwater lobsters. But these animals are found only in the Northern Hemisphere, so it would be surprising if they had existed in Antarctica 50 million years ago, Bomfleur says. “It could be an extinct relative with similar types of sperm.” There will be no extractable DNA left in the sperm fragments, Bomfleur adds, because the chemical make-up of the organic material would have changed from its original composition over such a long time. But his team expect that the cells they saw under the microscope are not merely mineralized outer casts of the original cell’s shape, but will retain their inner structure. Taxonomic tool The structure of sperm cells has been studied for decades as a way of determining evolutionary relationships between worm species. The team did not have access to ultra-high-resolution instruments that might reveal more detail about the sperm’s microstructure than can be seen under the electron microscope. But if the fine structure of sperm is commonly preserved inside cocoons and can be imaged, Bomfleur thinks that future studies could provide important insights into the evolution of the kinds of worms that secrete cocoons. “If it should turn out that we can get this information, all of a sudden we would basically unlock an entire fossil record for a group that hardly had any identifiable fossils before,” he says. Soft-bodied microorganisms that do not usually fossilize, including nematodes4, have also been found preserved inside cocoons, but few researchers have studied them. Jakob Vinther, who studies invertebrate evolution at the University of Bristol, UK, agrees that cocoon fossils could represent an underexplored avenue for understanding the origin of earthworms and leeches. “I think we might have a really interesting system here that can be sort of a hidden window to the past,” he says. “There could be a lot of potential hidden gems inside those cocoons.” ||||| It's time to call Guinness World Records: Researchers on an Antarctic expedition have uncovered sperm cells dating to a whopping 50 million years ago, making these the oldest known animal sperm cells, a new study finds. The researchers found the sperm fragments embedded within the walls of a fossilized cocoon. The scientists said they suspect that an ancient relative of worms or leeches likely created the cocoon while mating, and released its sperm inside. The sperm became trapped in the cocoon before the enclosure's walls hardened, the researchers said. Just as amber can entrap and preserve insects, the cocoon preserved the sperm cells while fossilizing over millions of years, the researchers said. [See Images of the Oldest Petrified Sperm from an Ostracod] \\"Because sperm cells are so short-lived and fragile, they are vanishingly rare in the fossil record,\\" said lead author Benjamin Bomfleur, a paleontologist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. \\"Our discovery of sperm in a leech cocoon from Antarctica is the oldest record of fossil animal sperm and one of only a tiny number of such fossils in the geological record.\\" The researchers discovered the cocoon while sieving sediments for small vertebrate remains during an expedition in Antarctica, Bomfleur said. The research team then used a scanning electron microscope to examine the fossil's surface, and the particles on it, at very high magnifications, he said. Researchers found the fossilized cocoon at this snowy location in Antarctica. Credit: Federico Degrange The scientists also used high-power X-rays from a particle accelerator in Switzerland to image the cocoon's internal structure. These analyses revealed that the cocoon held bacteria and sperm cells, Bomfleur said. However, the early Eocene specimen didn't hold entire sperm cells, just pieces of them. \\"All we found are fragments of the drill-bit–shaped 'head regions,' ornamented midpiece regions that presumably contain the nuclei, and very long, whiplike tails, some attached to the midpiece regions,\\" Bomfleur told Live Science in an email. It's challenging to compare sperm fragments to the sperm of modern species, but the drill-bit-shaped head regions \\"do appear strikingly similar to those of this one peculiar group of leechlike worms that is today only found living symbiotically on crayfish in the Northern Hemisphere,\\" Bomfleur said. He added that the next-oldest known fossil of animal sperm is also from the Eocene, dating to about 40 million years ago. Researchers found that specimen, which belonged to a relative of insects called a springtail, in a piece of Baltic amber, Bomfleur said. However, the oldest known fossil sperm cell doesn't belong to an animal, but to a plant called a chert found in Scotland. The plant dates to the early Devonian, about 410 million years ago, Bomfleur said. The new study is a \\"well-done investigation,\\" said Renate Matzke-Karasz, a geobiologist at Ludwig-Maximilian-University in Germany. The finding of the \\"entombed micro-treasures\\" may help illuminate the family tree of worms and leeches, of which little is known because fossils of these soft-bodied creatures are rare, Matzke-Karasz said. \\"I am sure a broader search for more such fossils will help create a clearer view on the evolution of these animals,\\" she said.

Department of Palaeobiology, Swedish Museum of Natural History We all know about how mosquitos trapped in amber: Can lead to dinosaur biker gangs: (Or, at the very least, awesome memes) But what about worm sperm trapped in a cocoon? It probably won't lead to insane theme parks with a death wish, but it could change our understanding of ancient microbes. In a paper published today in Biology Letters, Benjamin Bomfleur and his colleagues announced the discovery of 50 million year old sperm cells found in a cocoon in Antarctica. This is the oldest animal sperm ever discovered, but what's really exciting is where it was found: in a tiny cocoon in Antarctica. These cocoons aren't like cocoons used by butterflies to make their lovely transformation from lowly caterpillar to gorgeous winged creature. Instead these cocoons are integral to the mating process of many different species of worm and leech. After mating, the worms secrete a sticky gel like cocoon that contains the egg and sperm. Over time, it hardens, trapping the cells inside. Leech Diagram Benjamin Bomfleur ||||| A fossilized sperm cell (Department of Palaeobiology, Swedish Museum of Natural History) Benjamin Bomfleur can’t help but laugh a little when talking about this latest, record-setting discovery. “A 50-million-year-old worm sperm from Antarctica?” he said between chuckles. “Who would have thought that’s possible?” And yet, what Bomfleur, of the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and other researchers stumbled upon was a serious discovery: the oldest animal sperm ever found. As it goes with many great discoveries, this wasn’t what they were looking for. While on an expedition on Seymour Island in the Antarctic, Thomas Mörs, a paleobiologist at the same museum, was looking for signs of small mammal bones when he discovered a fossilized cocoon. Remembering that cocoons like this often carried notable remains of plants, he passed it along to Bomfleur, a fellow palaeobiologist. Bomfleur took it and started looking for plant remains. That’s when he noticed the long, fragile remains of what appeared to be a sperm. No expert in sperm himself, Bomfleur sent pictures of the specimen along to Marco Ferraguti, who happens to be an expert in annelid sperm. Through radiometric dating, it was determined that the cocoon and its contents were at least 50 million years old, making the sperm the “oldest fossil animal spermatozoa yet identified.” After comparing the pictures with his “enormous collection” of sperm pictures, Ferraguti determined the specimen was likely the product of a “crayfish worm.” Now retired, Ferraguti made a point of mentioning that he finds it amusing that he gets to be part of such an eye-catching study because, while in the field, he found it “really, really difficult to tell people the work [he does] is interesting.” What allowed this sperm to survive for so long was the biology of its creator. The ancient worm secretes a cocoon, about 2 millimeters around, which then typically serves as a protective housing for an egg and sperm when the worm reproduces. The cocoon is formed by a sticky mucus that takes several days to harden, but once it does, biological material, such as sperm, can be trapped along its walls. General location of Cocoon fossil. (Federico Degrange) This can preserve all kinds of different materials for centuries. Bomfleur likened it to amber preservation, though it’s unlikely this could be used for the creation of a Spielberg-esque, Jurassic worm (sorry). “These things are — they are flexible,” Mörs said, comparing the cocoon to similar fossils typically formed by plants. “I didn’t expect at the beginning that these were from animals.” The downside, Bomfleur said, is that the sperm was not completely intact. It was broken into fragments, making it difficult to learn much about the anatomy of this specific worm. However, the research team also found remnants of clam shells and small animals within this cocoon. The evolutionary history of Citellata (earthworms, leeches, etc.) is largely unknown, the team wrote in their paper, which was published in Biology Letters this week. Finding remnants of this type of species in the Northern Hemisphere is particularly rare, the study said, indicating that the evolutionary history of these worms is more complex than once thought. More importantly, Bomfleur explained that though worms themselves don’t fossilize well, sperm can be a better clue as to the creator of a given cocoon. This discovery should encourage future researchers to look for similar structures. “I think we might have a really interesting system here that can be sort of a hidden window to the past,” Jakob Vinther, who studies invertebrate evolution at the University of Bristol, told Nature. “There could be a lot of potential hidden gems inside those cocoons.” While fossilized sperms are a rare find, Seymour Island is a known hot spot of noteworthy fossils, Mörs said — he’s been there three times already. The only part of Antarctica that is completely free of ice cover, the island is a perfect location for extraction. Mörs said other fossils originating from the mainland of the continent often wash up onto the island, bringing a variety of fossils, including small mammal bones and shark teeth.

His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle.

Parliament must consider all petitions that reach a threshold of 100,000 votes for a debate and, although the decision has yet to consider the motion for a debate, the Foreign Office responded to the signatories by email on Friday evening, pointing out that over 33 million have had their say. Referring to the wording of the petition, which asks for a second vote to be held because the vote to leave did not surpass 60% of the vote and the turnout was less than 75%, the government response states that the European Union Referendum Act did not include rules about minimum turnout. The statement said: “The act was scrutinised and debated in parliament during its passage and agreed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The act set out the terms under which the referendum would take place, including provisions for setting the date, franchise and the question that would appear on the ballot paper. The act did not set a threshold for the result or for minimum turnout. “The prime minister and government have been clear that this was a once in a generation vote and, as the prime minister has said, the decision must be respected. We must now prepare for the process to exit the EU and the government is committed to ensuring the best possible outcome for the British people in the negotiations.” The petition, which was started by leave activist William Oliver Healey in May, when polls suggested remain would win, has been the subject of controversy after it was discovered that thousands of signatures were fake. The petitions committee’s own statement underneath reads that the decision on the petition was to be postponed until 12 July. It read: “The committee has decided to defer its decision on this petition until the government digital service has done all it can to verify the signatures on the petition. We have already had to remove 77,000 fraudulent signatures. “The committee wishes to make clear that, although it may choose to schedule a debate on this petition in due course, it only has the power to schedule debates in Westminster Hall – the second debating chamber of the House of Commons. “Debates in Westminster Hall do not have the power to change the law, and could not trigger a second referendum.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"The UK government has stated that despite an e-petition signed by over 4.1 million people, there will be no second referendum on EU membership, referring to the original vote as a \\"once in a generation\\" event.

Article:","response":"Title: Hatching Eggs Successfully: A Complete Guide for a Healthy Flock Intro: If you're a poultry enthusiast, there's no better feeling than welcoming a new generation of hatchlings into your flock. Hatching eggs can be a rewarding and fulfilling process, but it also requires care, patience, and attention to detail. In this article, we'll provide a comprehensive guide on how to mark, separate, incubate, and handle eggs for a successful and healthy hatch. 1. Marking the Eggs The first step in hatching eggs successfully is accurate identification. To prevent any mix-ups, use a pencil to lightly mark each egg with an identifying symbol or number. This can also help you track the development progress of each egg during the incubation period. Remember to handle the eggs gently and use a soft pencil to avoid damaging the shell's structure. 2. Separating the Eggs When dealing with multiple eggs, it's essential to separate them in a way that minimizes contact and the risk of contamination. Gently and carefully place each egg into their own clean egg carton or tray with the pointed end down, making sure there's enough space between them to prevent potential contact during incubation. 3. Choosing the Right Incubation Medium To support a successful hatch, an incubation medium that retains water and remains sterile is crucial. The medium's purpose is to mimic a mother hen, ensuring that the eggs receive optimal temperature, humidity, and protection from contaminants. Vermiculite, perlite, and coconut coir are all excellent choices for an incubation medium, as they can retain moisture efficiently while maintaining a sterile environment. 4. Maintaining Moisture Levels One of the critical factors in successful hatching is ensuring that the incubation medium remains moist throughout the entire process. Depending on the medium you choose, you might need to mist it with water periodically to maintain ideal humidity levels. Make sure to monitor these levels regularly and follow the recommendations provided for your selected medium. 5. Preparing the Eggs for Incubation Now that your incubation medium is ready, create small indentations in it for each egg with your finger. Ensure that these indentations are large enough to hold the eggs securely without causing any pressure or stress on the shells. This step is crucial in preventing possible damage and ensuring a healthy environment for the developing embryos. 6. Transferring the Eggs to the Incubator When it's time to move the eggs into their incubator, handle them with the utmost care and delicacy. Using clean hands or sterilized gloves, gently and carefully place each egg into their designated indentations in the medium. Avoid touching or rotating the eggs too much during this process, as excessive movement can cause damage and interfere with the embryos' development. 7. Incubating the Eggs With the eggs safely placed into the incubation medium, it's time to put the container into the incubator. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations for optimal temperature and humidity levels for the specific type of egg you're incubating, as these can vary between different bird species. Monitoring the incubation process is essential. Check the eggs regularly for fertility signs, such as embryonic activity, and be prepared to remove any unfertilized or non-viable eggs promptly. This will help prevent bacterial growth or other issues that could compromise the health of the developing embryos. In Conclusion: Hatching your own eggs can be an exciting and gratifying experience. By following the guidelines outlined in this article, you can ensure a successful and healthy hatch for your new additions to the flock. Remember, patience and attention to detail are key in achieving the best results and raising a thriving generation of birds."},{"question":"Eficienţă? Translate this to English?","response":"The Romanian word \\"Eficienţă\\" translates to \\"Efficiency\\" in English. Efficiency generally refers to the ability to do or produce something without wasting materials, time, or energy. It is the quality or degree of being efficient. The term \\"efficiency\\" can be applied in several contexts, 1. In business or economics, efficiency refers to the optimal production and distribution of goods and services. An efficient business manages its resources so that each unit of an input produces the maximum output, and the output is distributed optimally to meet the business's ultimate goal, such as profit maximization, stakeholder value, or customer satisfaction. 2. In engineering, efficiency describes the extent to which energy is conserved in a system. A machine is efficient if it converts the majority of its input energy into useful work with limited waste or output in other forms like heat or sound. 3. For appliances or devices, energy efficiency refers to their capacity to transform energy from a power source into functioning movements or tasks while minimizing waste. 4. In the everyday context, efficiency is seen in how well a person or system can accomplish a task with minimal waste, effort, time, or resources. 5. In computer science, the computational efficiency of algorithms is a significant concern - especially for big data analysis, machine learning algorithms, data mining, and other processor-intensive tasks. 6. Environmental efficiency involves using less energy to provide the same level of energy service. So, to sum up, \\"Eficienţă\\" is a concept about optimal and effective use of resources to attain a particular goal with minimum waste, which covers a wide range of applications in all fields of daily and professional life."},{"question":"Given the question: Given the following passage \\"One commentator has observed that, notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981–2002, the level of loyalty to the British monarchy by the St Helena population is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world.

While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers mismatched payments. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partners, Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed and arrange it to look like a murder-suicide. However, after Bernie leaves the gangsters decide Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his grabbiness as well as his fooling around with a girlfriend of one of the mobsters, and order that he be killed instead.Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and speaks to the hitman Paulie (Don Calfa) on the phone, planning the murders and establishing an alibi, unaware the conversation is being recorded on Bernie's answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, injects Bernie with a fatal overdose, then plants heroin on him.

In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would bowl A fruits be preserved longer or shorter than bowl B fruits? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","response":"Bowl A fruits, which are glace fruits, would be preserved longer than bowl B fruits, which are non-glace fruits. This is due to the process of glace fruit preparation where the fruits are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.

The eastern cougar has been declared extinct by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, confirming decades of suspicion that the elusive subspecies was no more. The large, solitary predatory cat once lived in every Eastern U.S. state in a variety of habitats, including coastal marshes, mountains and forests, said Dr. Mark McCollough, the agency's lead scientist for the eastern cougar. But you've probably never seen an eastern cougar - the last confirmed identification was in 1938 in Maine. Other subspecies of the cougar, also known commonly as mountain lions, wildcats, panthers and pumas, still exist in the United States, including the Florida panther. Scientists have held out hope, based on scattered reports, that a few eastern cougars remained. Those sightings turned out to be other subspecies from the Western United States - where the cougar population is growing and expanding its range eastward - or captive animals that were freed or escaped. \\"We still have cougars and mountain lions in the United States that look identical to what we had in eastern North America, and that's probably what people are still seeing,\\" McCollough said. \\"But the scientific and historical evidence point to the conclusion that the eastern cougar subspecies has not existed for a while.\\" It typically takes the agency a long time - and a lot of field work - to officially declare an animal extinct. People often confuse cougars with white-tailed deer, bobcats, even yellow labs, said Martin Miller, the service's Northeast Region chief of endangered species. But near the sites of reported spottings, scientists have been unable to find the physical marks commonly associated with cougars in the wild, such as scratching posts and cached animal remains. \\"We recognize that many people have seen cougars in the wild within the historical range of the eastern cougar,\\" Miller said. \\"However, we believe those cougars are not the eastern cougar subspecies.

The use of words such as \\"delicious,\\" \\"quirky,\\" \\"terrific,\\" and \\"fanciful\\" suggest that the critic has enjoyed this particular film. \\"Delicious\\" is not a word commonly associated with movies, which indicates a refreshing and unique experience. This word is often used to describe something very pleasing or enjoyable, especially to the senses or the mind, implying that they found the content of the movie to be excellent and very satisfying. Quirky movies generally denote an element of originality and eccentricity, straying from the norm, so when the critic writes that the movie is \\"quirky,\\" they're suggesting that it's unusual in an appealing and interesting way. Quirky can also mean unconventional and offbeat, indications of originality, suggesting innovation and a breakaway from typical film tropes, which many critics often appreciate. The adjective \\"terrific\\" directly attached to \\"screenplay,\\" implies that the story or plot was exceptionally well-written and compelling. These words demonstrate a high level of satisfaction with the story, its characters, and its dialogue, suggesting the writing was not only competent but exciting and impressive. Likewise, the word \\"fanciful\\" linked with the direction suggests that the critic found the movie to be guided in a imaginative or even whimsical way. Fanciful direction is suggestive of a director's inventive and imaginative execution, using creative methods to tell the story. The specific mention of Michael Gondry, known for his distinct and creative directing style, lends more weight to this supposition. Moreover, these positive words are distributed amongst multiple aspects of the film, such as the screenplay and the direction, which means that the critic's positive view of the film is comprehensive rather than focused on a single standout feature. This distribution of positive language with respect to different movie aspects (screenplay, direction, etc.) could be taken to imply that the reviewer found it well-rounded with various elements working effectively in harmony, heightening their overall entertainment and appreciation of the movie. In summary, all of these points suggest that the critic not only enjoyed the film greatly but also appreciated its associations with uniqueness (quirkiness), high quality (terrific screenplay), and creativity (fanciful direction). Therefore, one can conclude that the critic views the movie in a positive light."},{"question":"Question: Combine facts and answer this: In which year was this band whose debut studio album is called \\"In Our Bones\\" formed?

Check the company’s website directly to look for any specials. You should also check at least 4-5 aggregate sites like Kayak.com, Booking.com, or Trivago to get an idea of potential price ranges. When traveling to a different country, local aggregate booking sites may offer better deals than the ones you find in your home country. Check local listings to see if you can grab a better deal. To get the best idea of how pricing varies, compare itineraries that are the same. Check the same dates and destinations on different sites to see where you can really find the best deals. If you’re traveling as a representative of a particular company or organization, they may have an in-house travel site or travel booker that you are required to use. Check with your company’s administrative department to see if that’s the case. Sites like Kayak.com, Booking.com, and Trivago are great to check for deals on hotels. It's worth considering other accommodations, though, too. Sites like Airbnb and VRBO let you book rooms, houses, and apartments directly from the current occupants. These can be great if you're traveling for long periods or want amenities like a full kitchen to save on meals out. Likewise, if you're planning on staying in a hostel, hostel-booking sites usually have better offers than hotel booking sites. HostelWorld.com and HostelBookers.com are two options with extensive listings. If you're going camping, check your site well in advance. Popular campsites like Big Bend National Park in Texas can run out of permits months in advance. Don't assume you can just show up at a campsite and set up your tent. You often need to reserve a spot on site. Think about different routes you can take to get to your destination. Flights directly into Washington DC are often expensive, for example, because the DC airports are close to public transportation, hotels, and attractions. Flying into Baltimore is often more affordable, and still puts you a 20-minute train ride away from DC. If you still haven’t booked your transportation or accommodations within 8 weeks of your intended departure date, you need to do so now. The longer you wait, the more expensive these will get. You also run the risk of the flight you want selling out or the hotel being fully booked. For international trips, you may need to book further in advance, especially if you are flying or taking a cruise. Try to book at least 4 months out from your intended departure date in these cases. Trips taken during popular travel times should also be booked further in advance. If you plan to go to Boston for St. Patrick’s Day, for example, expect hotels to fill up months in advance. Some modes of transportation don’t require you to book as far in advance as others. A train, for example, may only require a reservation the week before your departure. Check your carrier to see their suggested booking time frame. You don't need a restaurant reservation for every meal when you're gone, but you should think about meal plans before you go. Think about how often you want to eat out, and how you want to handle things like snacks. For example, if you have kids, you may want to pack some sandwich bags and get a full-sized box of their favorite snack. That way, you can take these to go instead of spending on snacks every day. Think about what meals may be included with your accommodations. Does your hotel offer free breakfast? If not, you may need to adjust your budget to include breakfasts. If you're staying at an all-inclusive resort or on a cruise, check with the resort to see if you need to book meals in advance. At some resorts and on some cruises, you have to make reservations for a certain seating time, even if the meal is included in your price. Consider your flight, too. If you have a long-haul flight where a meal is included, let the airline know about any dietary restrictions you may have at least 1 week before you depart. This way, you can ensure you get the right in-flight meal for your diet. You don’t need to plan out every second of every day, but schedule time for the things you really want to see and do. Researching and planning these before you leave allows you to see and do more of what you want. It also gives you the opportunity to make reservations or book tickets and tours for things that sell out in advance. Your daily itinerary doesn’t have to be elaborate. It may be as simple as “Breakfast: 9-10, Acropolis tour: 10:30-12:30, explore the city after the tour ends.” Just make sure you include those things that are really important for you to see and do. If you’re traveling for business, your itinerary may have to be more formal. Check with your company or client to see if you need to submit a formal itinerary for your meetings and activities. Leave some room in between activities in case things run long or you have any unexpected delays. You don't need to plan every minute of every day, just make sure you have time to fit in those things that are really important for you to see or do. Summary:","response":"Booking travel accommodations and transportation can vary greatly in price depending on where they are booked. To find the best deals, check the company's website and compare prices on at least 4-5 aggregate sites like Kayak, Booking, and Trivago. Local booking sites in the destination country may offer better deals. Ensure to compare itineraries with the same dates and destinations on different sites. Companies may have an in-house travel site or booker that must be used. Options like Airbnb and VRBO or hostel booking sites like HostelWorld and HostelBookers offer alternative accommodation choices. Book campsites well in advance and consider different routes to reach your destination to save money. For international trips or popular travel times, booking far in advance is recommended. Some transportation modes, like trains, may require reservations closer to the departure date. Plan meals and consider if they are included with accommodations, and inform airlines of dietary restrictions for long flights. Schedule an itinerary for important activities and leave some extra time for unexpected delays or changes. For business trips, a more formal itinerary may be necessary.

She inherits her grandmother's cottage, which has been in the family for generations.

(English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi.

It would be more than just an assertion on his part.” Mr. Snowden is living and working in Russia under a one-year asylum. The Russian government has refused to extradite Mr. Snowden, who was indicted by the Justice Department in June on charges of espionage and stealing government property, to the United States. Mr. Snowden has said he would return to the United States if he was offered amnesty, but it is unclear whether Mr. Obama — who would most likely have to make such a decision — would make such an offer, given the damage the administration has claimed Mr. Snowden’s leaks have done to national security. Because the N.S.A. is still uncertain about exactly what Mr. Snowden took, government officials sometimes first learn about specific documents from reporters preparing their articles for publication — leaving the State Department with little time to notify foreign leaders about coming disclosures. With the security agency trying to revamp its computer network in the aftermath of what could turn out to be the largest breach of classified information in American history, the Justice Department has continued its investigation of Mr. Snowden. According to senior government officials, F.B.I. agents from the bureau’s Washington field office, who are leading the investigation, believe that Mr. Snowden methodically downloaded the files over several months while working as a government contractor at the Hawaii facility. They also believe that he worked alone, the officials said. But for all of Mr. Snowden’s technical expertise, some American officials also place blame on the security agency for being slow to install software that can detect unusual computer activity carried out by the agency’s work force — which, at approximately 35,000 employees, is the largest of any intelligence agency. ||||| The surveillance agency says it has spent tens of millions of dollars to remove computers the former NSA contractor had access to, including the cables that connected them to the network. Edward Snowden. Officials at the National Security Agency are divided over whether to offer an amnesty deal to espionage suspect Edward Snowden, who is said to have cost the agency tens of millions of dollars to ensure his presence was removed from its networks. The former NSA contractor, who has been granted asylum in Russia, is said to have stolen 1.7 million classified documents from government computers before fleeing the US in June. However, law enforcement officials concede they may never know the size of his haul. \\"They've spent hundreds and hundreds of man-hours trying to reconstruct everything he has gotten, and they still don't know all of what he took,\\" a senior administration official told The New York Times. \\"I know that seems crazy, but everything with this is crazy.\\" Whether return of that cache is worth a deal with Snowden is a contentious subject within the NSA. Rick Ledgett, who runs the NSA task force assessing the damage on the Snowden leaks, told CBS' news program \\"60 Minutes\\" during a segment aired Sunday (see below) that an amnesty deal is \\"worth having a conversation about. I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high. It would be more than just an assertion on his part.\\" (Disclosure: CBS is the parent company of CNET.) Ledgett concedes that opinion is \\"not unanimous\\" within the agency. NSA chief Gen. Keith Alexander compares the amnesty suggestion to a hostage-taker asking for amnesty after killing 10 of 50 hostages. \\"I think people have to be held accountable for their actions,\\" Alexander said. Alexander, who has served as director of the NSA since 2005 and is expected to step down next year, said he offered his resignation as a result of the leak. \\"I offered to resign,\\" Alexander said. \\"And they said, 'We don't see a reason that you should resign. We haven't found anybody there doing anything wrong.'\\" During the task force's damage assessment, the NSA discovered Snowden has some unusual habits, especially when working at home. \\"He would work on the computer with a hood that covered the computer screen and covered his head and shoulders, so that he could work and his girlfriend couldn't see what he was doing,\\" Ledgett said. One of the task force's fears was that Snowden might have left a bug or virus behind on the NSA's network. So the agency removed all the computers he had access to on the agency's classified and unclassified networks -- including the cables that connected them -- at a cost Ledgett estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. While the NSA has come under considerable scrutiny and criticism in the wake of Snowden's leaks, Alexander said the agency's surveillance activities are necessary to the nation's defense. In addition to tracking terrorist activities, the NSA has a team monitoring the threat of cyberattack on the nation's critical infrastructure, including the financial system. \\"I believe that a foreign nation could impact and destroy major portions of our financial system,\\" Alexander said. One threat highlighted during the \\"60 Minutes\\" visit was dubbed the BIOS Plot, a virus that would attack the firmware that activates the hardware and operating system. Debora Plunkett, who directs cyber defense for the NSA, warns that such an attack would effectively brick computers. \\"Think about the impact of that across the entire globe,\\" Plunkett said. \\"It could literally take down the U.S. economy.\\" ||||| Add a location to your Tweets When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

No U.S. intelligence agency has ever been under the kind of pressure being faced by the National Security Agency after details of some of its most secret programs were leaked by contractor Edward Snowden.

How did 60 Minutes get cameras into a spy agency? Full disclosure, I once worked in the office of the director of National Intelligence where I saw firsthand how secretly the NSA operates. It is often said NSA stands for \\"never say anything,\\" but tonight the agency breaks with that tradition to address serious questions about whether the NSA delves too far into the lives of Americans. Gen. Keith Alexander: The fact is, we're not collecting everybody's email, we're not collecting everybody's phone things, we're not listening to that. Our job is foreign intelligence and we're very good at that. The man in charge is Keith Alexander, a four-star Army general who leads the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command. John Miller: There is a perception out there that the NSA is widely collecting the content of the phone calls of Americans. Is that true? \\"The fact is, we're not collecting everybody's email, we're not collecting everybody's phone things, we're not listening to that. Our job is foreign intelligence and we're very good at that.\\" Gen. Keith Alexander: No, that's not true. NSA can only target the communications of a U.S. person with a probable cause finding under specific court order. Today, we have less than 60 authorizations on specific persons to do that. John Miller: The NSA as we sit here right now is listening to a universe of 50 or 60 people that would be considered U.S. persons? Gen. Keith Alexander: Less than 60 people globally who are considered U.S. persons. But the NSA doesn’t need a court order to spy on foreigners, from its heavily protected headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., it collects a mind-numbing amount of data from phones and the Internet. They sort through it all looking for clues to terrorist plots, and intelligence on the intentions of foreign governments. To do all that they use a network of supercomputers that use more power than most mid-sized cities. Gen. Alexander agreed to talk to us because he believes, the NSA has not told its story well. Gen. Keith Alexander: \\"We need to help the American people understand what we're doing and why we're doing it.\\" And to put it simply, we're doing two things: We're defending this country from future terrorist attacks and we're defending our civil liberties and privacy. There's no reason that we would listen to the phone calls of Americans. There’s no intelligence value in that. There's no reason that we'd want to read their email. There is no intelligence value in that. What they are doing is collecting the phone records of more than 300 million Americans. John Miller: Then why do you need all of those phone records? Gen. Keith Alexander: How do you know when the bad guy who's using those same communications that my daughters use, is in the United States trying to do something bad? The least intrusive way of doing that is metadata. Metadata has become one of the most important tools in the NSA’s arsenal. Metadata is the digital information on the number dialed, the time and date, and the frequency of the calls. We wanted to see how metadata was used at the NSA. Analyst Stephen Benitez showed us a technique known as “call chaining” used to develop targets for electronic surveillance in a pirate network based in Somalia. Stephen Benitez: As you see here, I'm only allowed to chain on anything that I've been trained on and that I have access to. Add our known pirate. And we chain him out. John Miller: Chain him out, for the audience, means what? Stephen Benitez: People he's been in contact to for those 18 days. Stephen Benitez: One that stands out to me first would be this one here. He's communicated with our target 12 times. Stephen Benitez: Now we’re looking at Target B’s contacts. John Miller: So he's talking to three or four known pirates? Stephen Benitez: Correct. These three here. We have direct connection to both Target A and Target B. So we'll look at him, too, we'll chain him out. And you see, he's in communication with lots of known pirates. He might be the missing link that tells us everything. John Miller: What happens in this space when a number comes up that's in Dallas? Stephen Benitez: So If it does come up, normally, you'll see it as a protected number-- and if you don't have access to it, you won't be able to look. If a terrorist is suspected of having contacts inside the United States, the NSA can query a database that contains the metadata of every phone call made in the U.S. going back five years. John Miller: So you understand then, there might be a little confusion among Americans who read in the newspaper that the N.S.A. has vacuumed up, the records of the telephone calls of every man, woman and child in the United States for a period of years-- that sounds like spying on Americans. Gen. Keith Alexander: Right, and that's wrong. That's absolutely wrong. John Miller: You don’t hear the call? Gen. Keith Alexander: You don't hear the call. John Miller: You don't see the name. Gen. Keith Alexander: You don't see the names. John Miller: You just see this number, called that number. Gen. Keith Alexander: The-- this number-- the \\"to/from\\" number, the duration of the call and date/time, that's all you get. And all we can do is tell the FBI, \\"That number is talking to somebody who is very bad, you ought to go look at it.\\" But privacy advocates argue American’s phone records should not sit in bulk at the NSA, searchable under a blanket court order. They believe the NSA should have to get a separate court order for each number and that the record should stay at the phone company. John Miller: You get the bill from whatever the service provider is and you see who it's calling in America. You don't need to collect every American's phone numbers to do that. Gen. Keith Alexander: Well, the reality is if you go and do a specific one for each, you have to tell the phone companies to keep those call detail records for a certain period of time. So, if you don’t have the data someplace you can’t search it. The other part that's important, phone companies-- different phone companies have different sets of records. And these phone calls may go between different phone companies. If you only go to one company, you'll see what that phone company has. But you may not see what the other phone company has or the other. So by putting those together, we can see all of that essentially at one time. John Miller: Before 9/11, did we have this capability? Gen. Keith Alexander: We did not. John Miller: Is it a factor? Was it a factor? Gen. Keith Alexander: I believe it was. What Gen. Alexander is talking about is that two of the 9/11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were in touch with an al Qaeda safe house in Yemen. The NSA did not know their calls were coming from California, as they would today. Gen. Keith Alexander: I think this was the factor that allowed Mihdhar to safely conduct his plot from California. We have all the other indicators but no way of understanding that he was in California while others were in Florida and other places. Edward Snowden revealed another program called “prism.” Which the NSA says is authorized under the foreign intelligence surveillance act, or FISA. Prism is the program the NSA uses to target the Internet communications of terrorists. It has the capability to capture emails, chats, video and photos. But privacy experts believe the NSA’s dragnet for terrorists on the Internet may also be sweeping up information on a lot of Americans. Gen. Keith Alexander: No. That's not true. Under FISA, NSA can only target the communications of a U.S. person with a probable cause finding under specific court order. John Miller: A judge in the FISA court, which is the court that secretly hears the NSA cases and approves or disapproves your requests. Said the NSA systematically transgressed both its own court-appointed limits in bulk Internet data collection programs. Gen. Keith Alexander: There was nobody willfully or knowingly trying to break the law. The NSA says their analysts use highly technical systems under increasingly complex legal requirements and that when mistakes are made, they’re human errors, not intentional abuses. The Snowden leaks have challenged the NSA officials to explain programs they never intended to talk about. So how did an obscure contractor and computer specialist, pull off the most damaging breach of secrets in U.S. history? Few have spent more time thinking about that than Rick Ledgett. John Miller: How long have you been with the NSA? Rick Ledgett: For 25 years. John Miller: How many television interviews have you done? Rick Ledgett: One, this one. Ledgett runs the NSA task force doing the damage assessment on the Snowden leaks. And until this interview, the NSA has never discussed the specifics of the extent damage they believe Snowden has done and still could do. Rick Ledgett and John Miller CBS News John Miller: There've been all kinds of figures out there about how much he took, how many documents. We've been told 1.7 million. Rick Ledgett: I wouldn't dispute that. John Miller: How is that possible? Rick Ledgett: So, the people who control that, the access to those machines, are called system administrators and they have passwords that give them the ability to go around those-- security measures and that's what Snowden did. Edward Snowden worked for the NSA in Hawaii. Part of his job was to help maintain the NSA’s computers and also move large sets of data between different systems. John Miller: Did he take everything he had access to, or was he a careful shopper? Rick Ledgett: He did something that we call-- scraping. Where he went out and just went-- used tools to scrape information from websites, and put it into a place where he could download it. John Miller: At some point you then understood the breadth of what was missing and what could be missing? Rick Ledgett: Yes. John Miller: Of all the things he took is there anything in there that worries you or concerns you more than anything else? Rick Ledgett: It's an exhaustive list of the requirements that have been levied against-- against the National Security Agency. And what that gives is, what topics we're interested in, where our gaps are. But additional information about U.S. capabilities and U.S. gaps is provided as part of that. John Miller: So, I'm going to assume that there's one in there about China, and there's one in there about Iran, and there's another in there about Russia. Rick Ledgett: Many more than one. John Miller: Many more than one? Rick Ledgett: Yes. John Miller: How many of those are there? Rick Ledgett: About 31,000. John Miller: If those documents fell into their hands? What good would it do them? Rick Ledgett: It would give them a roadmap of what we know, what we don't know, and give them-- implicitly, a way to-- protect their information from the U.S. intelligence community's view. John Miller: For an adversary in the intelligence game, that's a gold mine? Rick Ledgett: It is the keys to the kingdom. So far, none of those crucial documents have been leaked. In Hong Kong last June, Snowden claimed that exposing the secret programs of the NSA did not make him a traitor or a hero, but an American. [Edward Snowden: The public needs to decide whether these programs or policies are right or wrong.] Snowden who is believed to still have access to a million and a half classified documents he has not leaked. Has been granted temporary asylum in Moscow, which leaves the U.S. with few options. John Miller: He's already said, \\"If I got amnesty I would come back,\\" given the potential damage to national security, what would your thought on making a deal be? Rick Ledgett: So, my personal view is, yes, it's worth having a conversation about. I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured and my bar for those assurances would be very high. It would be more than just an assertion on his part. John Miller: Is that a unanimous feeling? Rick Ledgett: It's not unanimous. Among those who think making a deal is a bad idea is Ledgett’s boss, Gen. Alexander. Gen. Keith Alexander: This is analogous to a hostage taker taking 50 people hostage, shooting 10 and then say, \\"If you give me full amnesty I'll let the other 40 go.\\" What do you do? John Miller: It's a dilemma. Gen. Keith Alexander: It is. John Miller: Do you have a pick? Gen. Keith Alexander: I do. I think people have to be held accountable for their actions. Gen. Keith Alexander: Because what we don't want is the next person to do the same thing, race off to Hong Kong and to Moscow with another set of data knowing they can strike the same deal. John Miller: This happened on your watch. A 20-something-year-old high school dropout contractor managed to walk out with in essence the crown jewels. Did you offer to resign about the Snowden incident? Gen. Keith Alexander: Yes. John Miller: The secretary of Defense, the director of National Intelligence, what did they say? Gen. Keith Alexander: Well, I offered to resign. And they said, \\"We don't see a reason that you should resign. We haven't found anybody there doing anything wrong. In fact, this could have happened to anybody in the community. And we don't need you to resign. We need you and deputy director to help work your way through is,\\" which is what we're doing. We'll do everything we can to fix it. Besides Edward Snowden, Gen. Alexander has growing concerns about a number of increasing threats to the United States, and the NSA's ability to stop them. That part of the story when we come back. The Snowden Affair Inside the NSA, where getting hired requires swearing an oath to your country and signing a vow of secrecy under the penalty of law, the very concept of what Edward Snowden did was hard for many to grasp. Gen. Keith Alexander felt he had a big stake in understanding Snowden, so he and Rick Ledgett who runs the Snowden task force got on a plane to Hawaii. They wanted to see the scene of the crime, Edward Snowden's desk. The Snowden Affair John Miller: Did you sit in his chair? Rick Ledgett: I did not. I couldn’t bring myself to do that. For Ledgett, the trip was important to understanding who Snowden was, and going back through the bits and the bytes, they discovered the first secrets Snowden stole, was how to cheat on a test to get a job at the agency. Rick Ledgett: He was taking a technical examination for potential employment at NSA; he used his system administrator privileges to go into the account of the NSA employee who was administering that test, and he took both questions and the answers, and used them to pass the test. At home, they discovered Snowden had some strange habits. Rick Ledgett: He would work on the computer with a hood that covered the computer screen and covered his head and shoulders, so that he could work and his girlfriend couldn't see what he was doing. John Miller: That's pretty strange, sitting at your computer kind of covered by a sheet over your head and the screen? Rick Ledgett: Agreed. We also learned for the first time, that part of the damage assessment considered the possibility that Snowden could have left a bug or virus behind on the NSA’s system, like a time bomb. Rick Ledgett: So, all the machines that he had access to we removed from our classified network. All the machines in the unclassified network and including the actual cables that connect those machines, we removed as well. John Miller: This has to have cost millions and millions of dollars. Rick Ledgett: Tens of millions. Yes. While Edward Snowden's leaks have been a disaster for the agency, the rest of the NSA’s mission has not slowed down. [Meanwhile, the Pakistani government has asked the US government to relook its drone policy.] Twice a week, under the dim blue lights of the NSA’s operations center, the director is given a briefing. [Sir, we added three new hostage cases this week.] With his deputy, Chris Inglis, Gen. Alexander listens to a rundown of global issues and international crisis the NSA may be asked to collect intelligence on. [Sir, moving to Afghanistan.] The meeting is called the stand-up because no one sits down, which is almost a metaphor for the pace of daily life in the NSA operations center. Howie Larrabee is the center’s director. Howie Larrabee: This is a 24/7 operation center. We haven’t had a day off. We haven’t had a Christmas off. And we haven’t had a major snowstorm off in more than 40 years. While the operation’s center grapples with terrorist plots and war zones, another team of analysts is monitoring what the agency says is the rising threat of a cyber attack that could take down anything from the power grid to Wall Street. \\"This is a 24/7 operation center. We haven’t had a day off. We haven’t had a Christmas off. And we haven’t had a major snowstorm off in more than 40 years.\\" John Miller: Could a foreign country tomorrow topple our financial system? Gen. Keith Alexander: I believe that a foreign nation could impact and destroy major portions of our financial system, yes. John Miller: How much of it could we stop? Gen. Keith Alexander: Well, right now it would be difficult to stop it because our ability to see it is limited. One they did see coming was called the BIOS Plot. It could have been catastrophic for the United States. While the NSA would not name the country behind it, cyber security experts briefed on the operation told us it was China. Debora Plunkett directs cyber defense for the NSA and for the first time, discusses the agency’s role in discovering the plot. Debora Plunkett: One of our analysts actually saw that the nation state had the intention to develop and to deliver, to actually use this capability-- to destroy computers. John Miller: To destroy computers. Debora Plunkett: To destroy computers. So the BIOS is a basic input, output system. It's, like, the foundational component firmware of a computer. You start your computer up. The BIOS kicks in. It activates hardware. It activates the operating system. It turns on the computer. This is the BIOS system which starts most computers. The attack would have been disguised as a request for a software update. If the user agreed, the virus would’ve infected the computer. John Miller: So, this basically would have gone into the system that starts up the computer, runs the systems, tells it what to do. Debora Plunkett: That's right. John Miller: --and basically turned it into a cinderblock. Debora Plunkett: A brick. John Miller: And after that, there wouldn't be much you could do with that computer. Debora Plunkett: That's right. Think about the impact of that across the entire globe. It could literally take down the U.S. economy. John Miller: I don't mean to be flip about this. But it has a kind of a little Dr. Evil quality-- to it that, \\"I'm going to develop a program that can destroy every computer in the world.\\" It sounds almost unbelievable. Debora Plunkett: Don't be fooled. There are absolutely nation states who have the capability and the intentions to do just that. John Miller: And based on what you learned here at NSA. Would it have worked? Debora Plunkett: We believe it would have. Yes. John Miller: Is this anything that's been talked about publicly before? Debora Plunkett: No, not-- not to this extent. This is the first time. The NSA working with computer manufacturers was able to close this vulnerability, but they say there are other attacks occurring daily. So the NSA has hired 3,000 young analysts as part of cyberdefense. Three of those analysts Morgan, Charles and Natalie describe to us how country's like China, Russia and Iran use social engineering to get inside a network. John Miller: They're looking for a disguise to get in? Charles: Exactly, yes. John Miller: And at what point will they ask the question that will cause the adversary to hand over that vulnerability? Morgan: So if I want to craft a social engineering message to lure you in so that I could potentially steal your username and password to gain access to a network, I may go on your Facebook page and see if you like golfing. So if you like golfing, then maybe I'm gonna send you a email about-- you know, a sale at a big golf retailer near you. John Miller: So you're trying to develop that little box that's irresistible-- Voices: Correct, Uh-huh. John Miller: --that the person has to click on and open, because-- Morgan: They'll take, yeah. John Miller: --they need to see what's inside? Morgan: Right. John Miller: And that is going to let loose all the gremlins that are going to take over whatever they're capable of taking over. Morgan: Yeah, that's their door in. Charles: The other real trick is, it's not necessarily one email. It could be 50 emails. In the new cyber paradigm, you can fail 50 times. You can ignore 50 emails. But if that 51st one is clicked, then that's it. Game over. But before computers, before phones, there were codes. The NSA was born out of the codebreakers of World War II. And even today, the most secret room inside the most secret building at the NSA is called the black chamber. This is where the nation’s top codebreakers work. We were able to look inside, but for obvious reasons, the NSA asked us not to show the people who worked there. The Black Chamber CBS News Outside the black chamber is this ordinary-looking file cabinet. But it can only be opened with a code known by a handful of people. Bob, who watches over it, explains it holds the records of every code America has broken over the last 60 years. John Miller: If I was Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, would I want what was inside there? Bob: You would be greatly interested in what’s in this box. Bob: This would be the ark of the covenant. When you walk around the NSA research building, where the codebreakers work, you see some very young people. And very smart people. John Miller: How long would it take you to do this? Joe: About a minute. John Miller: Are you serious? Joe: Yeah John Miller: Go. Many of the cryptologists skipped grades in school, earned masters degrees and PhDs and look more like they belong on a college campus than at the NSA. Actually, the Rubik’s cube took him one minute and 35 seconds. John Miller: You know, I didn't like you before. For this group, the Rubik’s cube was the easiest problem that day. Joslyn: So the idea here is we’re looking at a sequence of numbers, and we want to determine whether they’re random or not random. John Miller: How are you approaching that? Can you show me? Joe: We are looking at this data here and it is a bunch of random numbers on the screen. John Miller: That looks a tad overwhelming. Joe: It is. John Miller: Can you actually imagine solving this? Joe: We solve hard problem all the time. John Miller: Is there an unbreakable code? Chris Inglis: Theoretically, yes. There’s always been an unbreakable code. Chris Inglis is the former deputy director of the NSA. Among the areas he supervised, are the codebreakers. He says each summer 10,000 high school students apply for a few openings. Chris Inglis: We clear them fully. We give them full access to our problems. We give them problems that we could not solve. And they solve some number of those problems. The principle reason being that they bring a different perspective and audacity to it that we hadn’t thought about in all the years of experience that we’ve brought to bear. John Miller: So you’ve had occasions where you’ve given a difficult problem to a high school kid with a top-secret clearance whose come back and said “hey, I think I got this one?” Chris Inglis: For any given summer that’s more often the rule than the exception. We’re always pleasantly surprised. While high school kids on summer break may be cracking secret codes, this is still a spy agency that steals secrets, reads emails and listens to foreign leader’s phone calls. Among the Snowden leaks, perhaps the most embarrassing for the White House was that the NSA monitored some of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone calls. But Gen. Alexander says the NSA doesn’t choose who to spy on. They target the subjects and the countries that other U.S. agencies including the State Department ask for intelligence on. Gen. Keith Alexander: That's one of the ones that the White House and I think our principals are looking at. What is the appropriate measures? What should we do? And what are we gonna stop doing? From my perspective when we look at that it has to be both ways. Our country and their country has to come to an agreement to do the same. It can't be-- John Miller: Well-- Gen. Keith Alexander: --either way. John Miller: --does that mean that we'll just agree to stop spying on everybody including our friends if they all agree to stop spying on everybody including us? Gen. Keith Alexander: Well, I think that's gotta be part of the negotiation. And I think that's fraught with concern. What do you mean by-- John Miller: Do you think-- Gen. Keith Alexander: --\\"stop spying\\"? John Miller: --Chancellor Merkel hears President Obama's calls? Gen. Keith Alexander: Well, I don't know. But I know they have a great intelligence capability and that they collect foreign intelligence just like we do. This week, the CEOs of eight major Internet providers including Google, Apple and Yahoo asked the president for new limits to be placed on the NSA’s ability to collect personal information from their users. John Miller: One of the Snowden leaks involved the concept that NSA had tunneled into the foreign data centers of major U.S. Internet providers. Did the leak describe it the right way? Gen. Keith Alexander: No, that's not correct. We do target terrorist communications. And terrorists use communications from Google, from Yahoo, and from other service providers. So our objective is to collect those communications no matter where they are. But we're not going into a facility or targeting Google as an entity or Yahoo has an entity. But we will collect those communications of terrorists that flow on that network. Sources tell 60 Minutes the president’s intelligence review panel will recommend new limits on bulk collection of U.S. phone records which concerns Gen. Alexander. John Miller: After all of this controversy, you could come out of this with less authority than you went into it. What does that say? Gen. Keith Alexander: Well, my concern on that is specially what's going on in the Middle East, what you see going on in Syria, what we see going on-- Egypt, Libya, Iraq, it's much more unstable, the probability that a terrorist attack will occur is going up. And this is precisely the time that we should not step back from the tools that we've given our analysts to detect these types of attacks. ||||| Reuters General Keith Alexander has tried to shore up support for the National Security Agency by claiming the activities of its employees are closely monitored and that there is \\"100 percent audibility,\\" as if Americans need not worry about rogue actions by staffers. \\"The assumption is our people are just out there wheeling and dealing. Nothing could be further from the truth,\\" he said of the agency he directs. \\"We have tremendous oversight over these programs. We can audit the actions of our people 100 percent, and we do that.\\" So how does he explain the latest news? A weekend story in the New York Times cites senior Obama Administration officials declaring that they may never know the full extent of what contractor Edward Snowden took before leaving the United States for Hong Kong. \\"Investigators remain in the dark about the extent of the data breach partly because the N.S.A. facility in Hawaii where Mr. Snowden worked ... was not equipped with up-to-date software that allows the spy agency to monitor which corners of its vast computer landscape its employees are navigating at any given time,\\" the newspaper reports. \\"Six months since the investigation began, officials said Mr. Snowden had further covered his tracks by logging into classified systems using the passwords of other security agency employees, as well as by hacking firewalls installed to limit access to certain parts of the system.\\" ||||| Summary:","response":"The National Security Agency (NSA) seems to be divided over the idea of potentially offering an amnesty deal to Edward Snowden, who is believed to have stolen 1.7 million classified documents from government computers before fleeing the United States. While some officials within the NSA have expressed the worth in having a conversation about amnesty, others argue that people have to be held accountable for their actions. Edward Snowden is currently living in Russia under a one-year asylum, and has stated that he would return to the U.S. if he was offered amnesty. The damage assessment from Snowden’s leaks has cost the NSA tens of millions of dollars and has led to fears that Snowden may have left a bug or virus behind within the NSA’s network."},{"question":"Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What can be lighter when cut from different trees?\\" is in \\"Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature.

Dr. Wilhelm von Huber (James Woods), a top NASA scientist, relocates to Cape Canaveral with his 12-year-old son, Billy (Alex D. Linz). Their relationship has become strained in the wake of the recent death of Billy's mother, and the ever-widening gap between father and son has become obvious. Billy finds his father old-fashioned and boring. He wants to lead an exciting life: to be a hero like the astronaut Alan Shepard. However, Billy's life takes an exciting turn when he is hired by Dr. Donni McGuinness (Annabeth Gish), the Director of Veterinary Sciences, to help train the chimpanzees for NASA space missions. Billy begins to develop a close bond with one particular chimp named Mac. With Billy's help and companionship, Mac is chosen to become the first American astronaut launched into space. All seems like a wonderful game until Billy realizes that his new friend is being prepared to be hurled hundreds of miles into orbit on a historical mission - and that someone (William Atherton) at NASA is about to sabotage the mission.

Updated drives can make a big difference in performance, especially for older cards. You can figure which drivers you need by opening the Device Manager. Open the Start menu or screen and type \\"device manager\\" to find and open it. This will show all of the graphics adapters that you have installed. You will likely only have one or two items listed here. The \\"Display adapters\\" section will show the current model of your graphics card. If you have an Intel and an AMD or NVIDIA entry, you can ignore the Intel entry. The model of your graphics card will be listed after the manufacturer (i.e. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670) When you have two adapters listed here, one if for your motherboard and the other is for your graphics card. The motherboard graphics will almost always be Intel, and is not used if your monitor is connected to a graphics card from NVIDIA or AMD. You'll be able to download drivers directly from the manufacturer's website. Below are the driver download sites for the major manufacturers: NVIDIA - http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx AMD - http://support.amd.com/en-us/download Intel - https://downloadcenter.intel.com/ Use the search function or the automatic driver detection feature on the driver website to find the correct download. All of the major manufacturers can automatically detect your adapter and download the correct drivers for you. Most driver installers are about 300 MB in size, and may take a little while to download. After you download the driver installer, run it from your Downloads folder to begin installation. The installation may take a while, and your screen may flicker or go black during it. Decline the installation of any driver management software like GeForce Experience, as these typically just make your games run slower when they're open.","response":"To make your computer's picture look better and work faster, you need to update a part inside called a \\"graphics card.\\" Here's how: 1.

Article: From early times, man has been interested in art. People have often worked together to collect and save the world's art treasures. Fine art treasures from many countries are kept in an art museum called the Louvre in Paris, France. The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries. One of the artists was Lenardo da Vinci from Italy. Da Vinci's \\"Mona Lisa\\" is the best known painting in the museum today. In 1793, the Louvre became a public museum. It is a place where art treasures are kept for everyone to enjoy. Every year millions of people from all over the world come to the Louvre to see the masterpieces.

Lee was a prominent political figure in colonial America, and he played a significant role in the movement towards independence from Britain. The motion presented by Lee, known as the Lee Resolution, was comprised of three main components: 1. A declaration of independence from Great Britain, asserting the colonies' rights to exist as free and independent states. 2. The formation of foreign alliances in order to build relationships and secure support from other nations in the fight against Britain. 3. A plan for a confederation of the states to establish a formal, unified government among the colonies. Following the presentation of the Lee Resolution, the Continental Congress engaged in debates over the subsequent days, discussing whether it was the right time to proceed with such a significant and bold step as declaring independence. There were concerns about the possible repercussions, the colonies' ability to defend themselves against the powerful British military, and the necessity of gaining support from foreign powers. As a result of these debates, the Continental Congress decided to postpone the vote on the Lee Resolution. In the meantime, they established a Committee of Five – consisting of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston – to draft a formal declaration of independence. Thomas Jefferson took the primary responsibility for writing the document, which would later be known as the Declaration of Independence. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress reconvened to vote on the Lee Resolution. With 12 affirmative votes (New York abstained), the resolution passed, effectively marking the decision to break away from British rule. However, it was on July 4, 1776, when the Continental Congress approved the final text of the Declaration of Independence, that the United States officially declared itself an independent nation. Richard Henry Lee's motion to declare independence in the Continental Congress played a fundamental role in the founding of the United States, paving the way for the American Revolution and shaping the course of history for the nation."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A woman with glasses is face painting a blond girl.\\" that \\"A woman is painting a picture.\\"?

Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler (; Spanish pronunciation: [en'rike mi'gel i'glesjas 'preizler]; born 8 May 1975) is a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor and record producer. He is widely regarded as the King of Latin Pop. In 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled Quizas (Perhaps). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father. The album debuted at number twelve on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish language album on the chart at that period. Quizas sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. The three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number one singles on Billboard's Latin Chart. His last single from the album, \\"Para Que La Vida\\", reached a million spins on U.S. radio, the only Spanish language song to do so. The video to the song \\"Quizas\\" was the first Spanish language music video to be added to the selection on one of MTV's popular shows, Total Request Live. Iglesias performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, becoming the first to sing a Spanish song on the show, and opening doors for other artists such as Ricky Martin, Juanes and Jorge Drexler to perform their Spanish material. Iglesias included songs from Quizas in his \\"Don't Turn Off the Lights Tour\\", and the album went on to win the Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. By 2003 Iglesias released his seventh album, which he called 7, the second to be co-written by Iglesias. Among its more 1980s-inspired material, it features the song \\"Roamer\\", which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist, Tony Bruno. The CD also contained the song \\"Be Yourself\\", a song about independence (the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever succeed in his singing career). The first single was the song \\"Addicted\\", and was followed closely by a remix of the song \\"Not in Love\\", featuring Kelis. With this album, Iglesias went on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at Houston Rodeo and continued on to several countries, most of which he'd never previously visited playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt and Singapore before ending his tour in South Africa.","response":"This text is about Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler, a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer who is widely regarded as the King of Latin Pop.

His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology. He started in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway, the recording industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. Context: In 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced Blackbirds of 1928 on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show was a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over one year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, which captivated the audiences. From then on, Robinson's public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer's haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall's collaboration with Bojangles, they even appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson's manager) to star in another Broadway musical titled, \\"Brown Buddies\\", that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States. In 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in The Hot Mikado, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of My Object All Sublime stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World's Fair, and was one of the greatest hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named Bill Robinson Day at the fair. Robinson's next Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers, Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman, withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. All in Fun closed after four performances. Question: Did he go on to have more broadway shows after the third one? Answer:","response":"After the third Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), there is no information available that suggests Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson went on to have more Broadway shows.

Based on the given premise, it is clear that mailers transport much of their mail to downstream locations to take advantage of zoned rates for transportation in some classes. Therefore, we can conclude that mailers use zoned rates to their advantage in some classes. To provide a detailed explanation, let's break down the premise and hypothesis: Premise: \\"In some classes, mailers transport much of their mail to downstream locations to take advantage of zoned rates for transportation.\\" In this premise, it is stated that mailers do the following: 1. Transport much of their mail to downstream locations - This means that mailers are distributing their mail to locations further within the postal network, often bypassing initial sorting and distribution facilities. 2. Take advantage of zoned rates for transportation - Zoned rates are a pricing structure used by postal services where the cost of transport is determined by the distance between the sender and the recipient. By moving mail to downstream locations, mailers are effectively utilizing zoned rates and, in turn, lowering their overall shipping costs. Hypothesis: \\"Mailers use zoned rates to their advantage in some classes.\\" The hypothesis states that mailers strategically utilize zoned rates for transportation to their advantage, leading to potential cost savings. Given the premise, we know that mailers are actively moving mail to downstream locations to capitalize on these zoned rates, implying they are using this pricing structure to their advantage. Hence, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Mailers use zoned rates to their advantage in some classes.\\" is true, and the correct answer is (A) Yes."},{"question":"Review: I have seen a lot of Saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music, dance, drama and great cinema in his movies.

His father's (Ai Qing) original surname was written Jiang (Jiang ). Ai collaborated with Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron as the artistic consultant on the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Olympics. On 22 June 2011, the Chinese authorities released Ai from jail after almost three months' detention on charges of tax evasion. Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. (Chinese: Bei Jing Fa Ke Wen Hua Gong Si ), a company Ai controlled, had allegedly evaded taxes and intentionally destroyed accounting documents. State media also reports that Ai was granted bail on account of Ai's \\"good attitude in confessing his crimes\\", willingness to pay back taxes, and his chronic illnesses. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, he is prohibited from leaving Beijing without permission for one year. Ai's supporters widely viewed his detention as retaliation for his vocal criticism of the government. On 23 June 2011, professor Wang Yujin of China University of Political Science and Law stated that the release of Ai on bail shows that the Chinese government could not find any solid evidence of Ai's alleged \\"economic crime\\". On 24 June 2011, Ai told a Radio Free Asia reporter that he was thankful for the support of the Hong Kong public, and praised Hong Kong's conscious society. Ai also mentioned that his detention by the Chinese regime was hellish (Chinese: Jiu Si Yi Sheng ), and stressed that he is forbidden to say too much to reporters. After his release, his sister gave some details about his detention condition to the press, explaining that he was subjected to a kind of psychological torture: he was detained in a tiny room with constant light, and two guards were set very close to him at all times, and watched him constantly. In November, Chinese authorities were again investigating Ai and his associates, this time under the charge of spreading pornography. Lu was subsequently questioned by police, and released after several hours though the exact charges remain unclear. In January 2012, in its International Review issue Art in America magazine featured an interview with Ai Weiwei at his home in China. J.J. Camille (the pen name of a Chinese-born writer living in New York), \\"neither a journalist nor an activist but simply an art lover who wanted to talk to him\\" had travelled to Beijing the previous September to conduct the interview and to write about his visit to \\"China's most famous dissident artist\\" for the magazine. On 21 June 2012, Ai's bail was lifted. Although he is allowed to leave Beijing, the police informed him that he is still prohibited from traveling to other countries because he is \\"suspected of other crimes,\\" including pornography, bigamy and illicit exchange of foreign currency. Until 2015, he remained under heavy surveillance and restrictions of movement, but continues to criticize through his work. In July 2015, he was given a passport and may travel abroad.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

XPO 14.03 % on Wednesday reported its first profitable quarter in at least four years as the company gained new customers and moved forward with integrating more than a dozen acquisitions. The Greenwich, Conn.-based company, which has rolled up businesses from different corners of the logistics industry including multi-billion dollar acquisitions of transportation providers in the U.S. and Europe, posted a record 42.6 million profit for the second quarter, or 35 cents per diluted share. Wall Street analysts had expected 3 cents a share in profit, according to FactSet. XPO reported a 75.1 million loss a year earlier. The company also reported a record 170 million of free cash flow on and adjusted its target for free cash flow in the next quarter to 150 million from a range of 100 million to 150 million. Revenue for the quarter was 2.4 billion. “We reached a positive inflection point in the evolution of our business,” said Chief Executive Brad Jacobs, who called the results a “blowout quarter.” Mr. Jacobs said that the company is reducing its expenses by leveraging its larger size to secure better prices from suppliers. XPO has also improved margins by applying profitable practices from some of its recent acquisitions to the whole company. “The bottom line is, they’re executing,” said Donald Broughton, analyst at Avondale Partners LLC. “To get to the size they are, they proved that they’re first class in acquiring companies, and these results are demonstrating that they’re also first class in operating companies.” Some investors have been wary of XPO’s ability to generate profits after years of rapid growth. The company’s stock ended Wednesday up slightly at 28.94 a share, but down from a peak of over 50 last May, before it completed its acquisitions of French logistics firm Norbert Dentressangle SA XPO -0.16 % for 3.5 billion, a deal announced in April, and U.S. trucking company Con-way Inc. for 3 billion, announced in September. Shares jumped about 10% in after-hours trading following the release of second-quarter results. Last month, one of the company’s largest shareholders, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, which was one of three entities that provided the funds for XPO’s acquisitions, sold 4 million of its 13.6 million shares of the company, at a loss. XPO reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization of 354.9 million—a number which excludes one-time transaction-related and rebranding costs—up from 79.7 million a year earlier. It raised its short-term guidance to 1.265 billion of EBITDA, up from 1.25 billion. XPO is growing revenue by offering end-to-end logistics solutions, from arranging freight transportation to managing warehouses to delivering goods to customers’ doors, Mr. Jacobs said. The company, which has been rebranding all of its acquired companies under the XPO name and bringing them onto a shared software system, says that having large operations in both Europe and the U.S., with both supply chain and transportation services, have helped woo new customers like Spanish fast-fashion retailer Inditex SA, ITX 0.90 % owner of Zara. Mr. Jacobs added the rising popularity of e-commerce has been a key driver of growth, which also offers so-called “last mile” services, or the last leg of delivery to consumers. The company’s customers include IKEA, Lowe’s and mattress startup Casper Sleep Inc. “E-commerce continues to be one of the most important tailwinds for margin expansion in last mile…on both sides of the Atlantic,” he said. XPO’s transition to profitability comes amid weak demand for freight transportation, which has hit many of XPO’s competitors in the trucking industry. “This is a tough environment, and you can’t produce these kinds of results unless your entire management team is really doing a straight-A job,” said Mr. Broughton, of Avondale.

Realize that building a rock hard body for a male fitness model is a long process.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Unleash Your Inner Beast: How to Transform into the Ultimate Male Fitness Model Introduction Are you tired of staring enviously at male fitness models on Instagram, wishing that you too could transform your body into a lean and muscular physique? Dreams of rocking six-pack abs and a chiseled chest are achievable with dedication, hard work, and a consistent, disciplined approach towards your diet and workout regimen. Building the body of a male fitness model may be a long process, but the rewards are worth the time and effort. Here, we offer a comprehensive guide on how to work out like a beast, embrace a healthy lifestyle, and stay motivated every step of the way to become the ultimate male fitness model. 1. Develop a rock-solid workout routine Working out like a beast means pushing yourself to the limit. A well-crafted workout plan includes a mix of resistance training, endurance exercises, and flexibility workouts for a balanced physique. - Resistance Training: Strength training is crucial for building muscle mass and enhancing your metabolism. Incorporate compound exercises, such as deadlifts, squats, bench presses, and pull-ups, that target multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Isolation exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions, and leg curls should complement your compound movements for a well-rounded program. Aim for 3-5 sets of each exercise, with 8-12 repetitions for optimal muscle development. - Endurance Exercises: While building muscle is paramount, don't neglect the importance of cardiovascular health. Torch calories and increase your stamina with regular HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) sessions, plyometrics, or running to boost your overall fitness. Aim for at least 3 sessions of cardio per week to reap the benefits. - Flexibility Workouts: As a fitness model, good posture and healthy joints are key, so include flexibility and mobility training in your routine. Yoga, Pilates, or simply a post-workout stretch can help maintain a full range of motion and prevent injuries by keeping your muscles and joints supple and healthy. 2. Clean up your diet Eliminate processed junk food and nutrient-deficient snacks from your food intake. Instead, focus on clean, whole foods that fuel your body and help build muscle mass. - Protein Power: Aim for a diet rich in lean protein, such as chicken, turkey, fish, and low-fat dairy, as an essential building block for muscle tissue growth and repair. - Carb Control: Quality carbohydrates like whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables offer essential energy for workouts and recovery. Opt for slow-digesting options to keep you full longer and prevent unwanted fat storage. - Fats: Not all fats are created equal. Emphasize healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in nuts, avocados, and olive oil. Avoid saturated and trans fats found in fried, processed, and fast foods, which can contribute to cardiovascular issues and unwanted weight gain. - Hydration: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day – approximately 13 cups for men and 9 cups for women – to support vital functions, including digestion, absorption, circulation, and temperature regulation. 3. Prioritize recovery Sufficient sleep and rest are essential for optimal performance and muscle growth. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night to give your body time to repair and rejuvenate. Furthermore, schedule active rest days in your weekly routine, where you perform low-intensity activities like swimming, stretching, or leisurely walking, to support recovery and prevent overtraining. 4. Stay motivated and committed Consistency is king when it comes to realizing results. Don't give up when you hit a plateau or face setbacks. Stay driven by setting measurable, achievable goals and taking progress photos to visualize your accomplishments. Networking with a fitness community and surrounding yourself with like-minded people can also help maintain motivation. Conclusion Unleashing your inner beast and transforming your body into a male fitness model is no small feat, but the rewards are undeniably incredible. Embrace a healthy lifestyle, commit to a solid workout plan, and practice persistence. In time, you'll build the rock-hard physique you've always dreamt of and become the person you were meant to be.

So eminent a scholar as Dr. Lucille Hein was here. OPTIONS: a). unacceptable b). acceptable","response":"As an AI language model, I will analyze this sentence step-by-step to determine if a linguist would find it to be grammatically valid in English. 1. Sentence structure: The sentence is complex in structure, starting with an adverb \\"so\\" modifying an adjective \\"eminent,\\" which in turn describes a noun \\"scholar.\\" 2. Usage of \\"so\\": In this sentence, \\"so\\" is used appropriately as an intensifier, meaning it serves to emphasize the adjective \\"eminent.\\" 3. Appositive phrase: The phrase \\"as Dr. Lucille Hein\\" is used as an appositive to provide further information and clarification about the subject, the \\"scholar.\\" The use of \\"as\\" followed by the appositive is a common English construct that provides additional information and clarity. 4. Subject-verb agreement: The verb \\"was\\" agrees with its singular subject, \\"scholar,\\" in number and tense. Considering these steps, I find the sentence \\"So eminent a scholar as Dr. Lucille Hein was here\\" to be grammatically valid and, therefore, acceptable (option b)."},{"question":"If \\"A blond girl kisses a bow with brown hair while standing outside of a building.\\", does this mean that \\"There are people standing outside.\\"?","response":"Yes, this statement implies that there are people standing outside. The phrase \\"A blond girl kisses a boy with brown hair while standing outside of a building\\" provides information about the actions of two individuals, a girl and a boy, as well as their physical location. The girl is described to have blond hair, and she is in the act of kissing a boy who has brown hair. Furthermore, this action is taking place outside of a building. Since both the girl and the boy are involved in this occurrence, it is reasonable to infer that at least two people are standing outside of the building. To elaborate further, the statement also provides insight into their appearance in terms of hair color, which suggests that the focus of this scenario is on these particular individuals. Therefore, even though the statement does not directly say \\"There are people standing outside,\\" the presence of the blond girl and the boy with brown hair justifies the conclusion that there are people standing outside of the building. In summary, based on the information provided in the sentence, we can deduce that there are people standing outside—the blond girl and the boy with brown hair—since their actions are explicitly taking place in an outdoor setting adjacent to a building. This consequently confirms the notion that \\"There are people standing outside.\\""},{"question":"Facts: - caption: kelley becherer - strokes: freestyle , breaststroke - fullname: kelley becherer - birth date: 03 july 1990 - name: kelley becherer - nationality: american - birth place: sheboygan , wisconsin Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of kelley becherer .

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The process of food digestion inside the stomach is typically independent of external climate changes. However, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if a climate change occurs, it might have indirect effects on the process. Indirect effects of climate change on food digestion inside the stomach could include: 1. Changes in the availability and nutritional content of food: Climate change may result in alterations in agricultural practices and food production, which could lead to changes in the types and quality of food that people consume. These changes may affect digestion in various ways, such as by altering the balance of macronutrients and micronutrients in the diet. 2. Changes in microbiome composition: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in digestion and overall gastrointestinal health. Climate change could lead to changes in the environment that affect the composition and diversity of gut bacteria, altering the efficiency of digestion. 3. Increased stress and anxiety: Climate change can lead to increased stress and anxiety, which can affect the digestive system by causing gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and indigestion. 4. Impact on metabolism: While not directly related to the process of digestion in the stomach, climate change could influence an individual's metabolism by altering environmental temperatures. For example, sustained exposure to colder temperatures may increase energy expenditure, while warmer temperatures might lead to changes in appetite and digestion efficiency. While the perturbation hypothesis suggests that climate change might have indirect effects on the food digestion process, it is essential to recognize that these effects are influenced by various factors, such as diet, environmental conditions, and overall health. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize the impact of climate change on food digestion for everyone."},{"question":"Teachers have banned parents from attending a school sports day in case it leads to a 'Hillsborough-style crush' on the playing field, it has been claimed. The bizarre ruling was enforced at Glapton Academy primary school in Clifton, Nottinghamshire, this week. Headteacher Ruth Ellis wrote to parents telling them they were not invited to next month’s event, which includes the traditional egg and spoon race, because of 'rising pupil numbers'. Furious: Lisa Darby (right) and other mothers are unhappy they have been banned from Glapton's sports day. The school claimed an increase in the number of parents wanting to cheer on their children could cause a crush on the playing fields. Some parents even say they were told the school implemented the ban in order to 'avoid another Hillsborough'. The newsletter to parents sent on Monday stated: 'Thursday 3rd July is planned for sports day. 'Unfortunately, due to rising pupil numbers, we will not be able to invite parents to sports day this year.' Yesterday, furious parents blasted the decision branding it 'health and safety gone mad'. Crowd control: The bizarre ruling was enforced at Glapton Academy primary school in Clifton, Nottinghamshire. David Elliott, 35, whose six-year-old son attends the school, said: 'This is bonkers. Simple as that. 'We got a letter from school saying parents would not be invited to this year’s sports day. 'I rang the school up and spoke to someone who said it was because of health and safety. 'I asked what that meant and the woman said it was because there were more pupils at the school and therefore more potential parents coming on sports day. 'When I asked what the school was afraid might happen she said there was a potential for a crush. I said \\"what like Hillsborough?\\" sort of as a joke, and she said \\"yes\\".' 'I was gobsmacked. I’ve never heard anything do ridiculous in my life.' The school claims an increase in the number of parents could cause a crush on the playing fields (pictured) Other parents threatened to boycott the sports day on July 3 in protest at the ban. Vicky Samson, 32, whose two children Elliott, 11, and Daisy-May, five, go to the school, said: 'I’m not happy about this at all. 'If we can’t watch, then my children will not be taking part in the sports day. 'My son is in Year 6, so it will be his last sports day - I really want to see him compete. 'The sports day is held on a massive field as well and it’s never full. 'They manage to cram all the parents into a school hall, but apparently we won’t be able to watch on the huge field.' Lisa Darby, 32, whose six-year-old daughter Libby is in Year 1, added: 'I was absolutely fuming when I read the letter. 'Sports day should be a family event and parents should be able to share their child’s excitement at taking part in all the races. The primary school became an academy in January 2013 and was rated 'good' by Ofsted in its last inspection. 'It’s also a big part of growing up - I remember having my parents there at every sports day when I was a child. 'They even used to take part in things like the egg-and-spoon race.' Ms Darby said she was allowed to attend every sports day when her older daughter Chloe, 13, was a pupil at the school. She added: 'It just seems really unfair on Libby now, that she can’t have her mum and dad there like Chloe did. 'I just can’t understand the decision. It seems a big enough sports field to me and I don’t think there are more pupils there than last year.' 'When you’re a working parent, it’s hard to get involved in school life, so you have to take every opportunity you can' Manda Wilkinson, 26, mother. Manda Wilkinson, 26, said her son Logan, eight, was upset to learn his parents wouldn’t be able to cheer him on. She said: 'I find it disgusting that the school aren’t giving us the choice over whether we want to come or not. 'When you’re a working parent, it’s hard to get involved in school life, so you have to take every opportunity you can. 'Are they going to stop us watching the Christmas plays next?' The primary school, which only became an academy in January 2013, was rated 'good' by Ofsted in their last inspection in June last year. Inspectors reported that the school - which caters for boys and girls aged between 3-11 - had 318 pupils on the roll, an increase from 284 who attended in 2010. The teachers’ union NASUWT also hit out at Glapton Academy, blaming their new status for the decision. Neil Lawrence, secretary of the union in Nottingham, said: 'The decision to ban parents from sports day is another example of the loss of control the community feels when a local school becomes an academy and withdraws from local authority control. 'Decisions are made arbitrarily and without consultation.' 'Safeguarding our children is our main priority' Nick Ydlibi, chair of governors. Roger Steel, Conservative Nottingham City Councillor for the Clifton North ward, added: 'It’s traditional that parents attend sports days and I can’t see any logic behind restricting them. 'There’s a benefit to both the children and the parents, who are proud to see their youngsters getting fit through sport.' The Association for Physical Education has also criticised the school’s decision. Spokesman Eileen Marchant said: 'Schools always have reasons for making decisions but it’s a shame this school hasn’t made public its reasons. 'Parents always enjoy going to school sports days and it’s important to have them there to encourage the children. 'So much investment has been put into primary schools through the Government’s PE and school sport premium. 'One of the things schools are expected to do with this is increase competitive opportunities for children. Sports day would be an ideal opportunity to showcase how they are achieving this.' However, Nick Ydlibi, chairman of governors, said: 'No parent has contacted the school to comment on the matter of us being 'unable to invite' parents to our sports day this year. 'Safeguarding our children is our main priority. We feel that due to the rise in pupil numbers along with the close proximity of current major road and tram works a lot of strangers are in and around our school locality. 'Because of this it would be extremely difficult for us to guarantee the safety of our children at an outdoor event with open gates; this is why this year, this very difficult decision has had to be made. 'Our school offers parents lots of opportunities to come to special indoor events, such as Glapton’s Got Talent, our Art Gallery, and Show Time events which are happening in June and July.' The Hillsborough disaster happened on April 15, 1989, at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield during a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. A human crush resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since been blamed primarily on the police for letting too many people enter the stadium and remains the worst stadium-related disaster in British history and one of the world's worst football disasters. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"A school has decided that parents cannot attend the school sports day because there are too many people and they are worried that there may be a crush, which means when too many people are in one place and cannot move, just like what happened during a sad event called Hillsborough. The parents are very upset and think this decision is silly because the sports day is held in a big field and they do not think there will be too much crowding.

The group was targeting the overlords, and they decided to kidnap a person from the real world who could help them in their mission. 2. They chose to work with a villain, even though they acknowledged that using a villain to defeat another villain isn't sound reasoning. 3. Their choice was based on the person's effectiveness and lack of ties, rather than their reputation. They wanted someone who was solely focused on work and wouldn't have other distractions or potential consequences. From these steps, we can deduce that the villain was working with the group because they were kidnapped and chosen by the group, who believed that their skills and effectiveness in working against the overlords could be an asset in their mission.

Hypothesis: A person throws a ball. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Choose from: [a]. yes. [b]. it is not possible to tell. [c]. no.","response":"[a]. Yes. Based on the premise provided, the hypothesis can be concluded as true if the premise is true. Here's the detailed explanation: Premise: A young adult is throwing a softball to home base. This premise indicates that a young adult is performing an action of throwing an object, which in this case, is a softball. The intended target for the throw is home base. Hypothesis: A person throws a ball. The hypothesis is a simplified and generalized version of the given premise. Instead of referring to a \\"young adult,\\" the hypothesis uses the broader term \\"person.\\" Additionally, the hypothesis does not specify the type of ball being thrown (\\"softball\\" in the premise) or the target (\\"home base\\" in the premise). However, the core action of \\"throwing a ball\\" remains the same in both the premise and the hypothesis. Now let's evaluate the hypothesis and its relation to the premise. The premise clearly states that a young adult (a person) is throwing a softball (a ball) to home base. This statement satisfies the hypothesis, as a person is involved in the action of throwing a ball. The fact that the person is a young adult and the ball is a softball does not negate the hypothesis, as these details do not change the overall action. Based on this information, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. Therefore, the correct answer to the multi-select problem is [a]. Yes."},{"question":"Solve this math problem Solve 2331*s = 2366*s + 945 for s.","response":"To solve the equation 2331s = 2366s + 945 for the variable s, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable 's' on one side of the equation. We want to get all the terms with 's' on the same side of the equation, so we'll subtract 2331s from both sides: 2331s - 2331s = 2366s - 2331s + 945 This simplification results in: 0 = 35s + 945 Step 2: Isolate the term with 's'. Now, we want to get rid of the constant term 945 on the right side of the equation, so we'll subtract 945 from both sides: 0 - 945 = 35s + 945 - 945 This simplification results in: -945 = 35s Step 3: Solve for 's'. To find the value of 's', we will divide both sides by the coefficient 35: -945 / 35 = 35s / 35 This simplification results in: s = -27 So the solution to the equation 2331s = 2366s + 945 is s = -27."},{"question":"Write a negative movie review.","response":"Once upon a time, I watched a movie that made me feel sad because it wasn't very good.

Would \\"The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","response":"The country in the Middle East that France took control of after WW1 was Syria, including Lebanon. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the territories were divided among the Allied powers under various mandates. France was granted a mandate over the region by the League of Nations in 1920, leading to the establishment of the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon. French control lasted until the mid-1940s, when both countries gained their independence. Regarding your proposed answer, \\"The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict.\\" While this statement is true, it doesn't address the specific question about which country France took control of in the Middle East after WW1. This answer provides context for the establishment of mandates after the war but does not directly answer the question. A more appropriate response would be: \\"After World War 1, France took control of the region encompassing modern-day Syria and Lebanon under a mandate granted by the League of Nations.

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that in addition to railways, the rail trail is also accessible by bicycles. This is because the trail is a part of the East Coast Greenway, a proposed bike path designed to link major cities along the East Coast. The East Coast Greenway serves as a multi-use trail network for cyclists, walkers, and long-distance travelers. Stretching from Florida to Maine, it aims to provide a safe, scenic, and environmentally friendly transportation corridor. Apart from bicycles, this comprehensive trail system is designed to accommodate various non-motorized forms of transportation, including walking, jogging, and rollerblading, thus fostering a diverse array of outdoor recreational activities and promoting a healthy, active lifestyle.

These stats are meant to overwhelm you into buying something more expensive, but you don't have to fall for it. You can safely ignore the following terms and words when shopping -- they are just sales tactics: Refresh rates (anything above 120Hz is fine) Contrast Ratio Motion Rate, ClearMotion, TruMotion, etc. Viewing Angles Premium HDMI ports (all HDMI will look the same, no matter the port). HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is a newer color format meant to capture the greatest array of colors possible. The problem is that most sources (cable, Netflix, etc.) don't even send HDR quality color yet, so you'll likely notice little difference. That said, to better \\"future-proof\\" your TV, it might be a good option. Obviously, more color is better. That doesn't mean that this small uptick now, however, is necessarily worth the extra 2-300. Unless you love watching 3D movies, skip this feature. Most companies have already passed over them, quietly shuffling 3D TVs out of their inventory because consumers were largely unimpressed. Why? Because you need expensive glasses for every viewer, a 3D compatible player, and extra-expensive movies that cannot be played on non-3D players. So, unless you really want to recreate the home theater experience at any cost, skip this feature. All 3D TVs can play normal 2D movies. If you want the option, and money is no concern, you might as well go big for the 3D capabilities. Smart TVs have apps built in to show Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and other popular internet videos. While this may seem appealing, there are so many other streaming devices you can get cheaply that Smart TVs are often redundant. If you already have a way to stream media, skip the extra cost of a Smart TV. You can get a Google Chromecast, Roku, Amazon FireStick, Apple TV, or video game system with all the same features for 40-200. They are really just a fashion statement, with no real bearing on picture quality or enjoyment. Some people even lobby that they are worse, making it harder for a large group to all enjoy the screen from multiple angles. Summary:","response":"When shopping for TVs, there are many terms and features, but you don't need to worry about all of them. Refresh rates above 120Hz are fine, and words like Motion Rate or ClearMotion are just sales tactics. HDR might be good for more colors, but it's not very important right now. 3D TVs need expensive glasses and movies, so you can skip them. Smart TVs have apps like Netflix, but you can also use other devices to watch these videos. Curved TVs look nice but don't change the picture much.

Many talented musicians and singers, like a big team, worked together to introduce this musical style in churches over time.

Police are unsure who brought the gun into the house and why it was left within reach of a small boy, but Williams said an American preoccupation with guns is the underlying problem \\"The fascination with handguns, not just in the city, but in the country, has to stop,\\" he said. \\"We need to take a long look at what we're doing on the state, local and national level to keep these guns out of our communities.\\" Williams spoke briefly about the incident after a crime scene investigation team swept the scene and interviewed witnesses. He answered only a handful of questions before he left. A preliminary investigation shows that a 3-year-old boy picked up an unattended firearm and it went off, hitting a 1-year-old boy in the head, he said. The boy was taken to a nearby hospital and later pronounced dead. Police are still trying to piece together the events leading up to the shooting, Williams said, but he told reporters at least one adult was home when it happened. \\"There had to have been adults that either supplied the weapon, (loaded) the weapon, or that knew the weapon was there and didn't do anything to safeguard it,\\" he said. Neighbors said a mother lives in the house with three small boys, but it is unclear if the shooter is related to the victim. The victim's mother could be heard screaming from the back porch after officers told her that her son was dead. Several other children were inside the house when the shooting took place, Williams said. People who live in the East Side neighborhood said the families there mostly keep to themselves. Next-door neighbor Larry Simpson said he hung a TV in the living room of the victim's mother. \\"They were friendly with us,\\" he said, saying he spoke with them occasionally when they were sitting on their front porch. He called the shooting a senseless tragedy. ||||| CLEVELAND - The family of a 1-year-old boy shot to death by a 3-year-old playmate is speaking out about the tragedy. The child's aunt said 1-year-old Braylon Robinson was playing on the floor with two other children, ages one and three, who were described as the children of a family friend. Investigators said they believe the boy was shot by a 3-year-old child boy. Shonda Robinson, Braylon's aunt, said her sister heard the gun go off, but was on the couch facing the other direction when the 3-year-old apparently found the weapon. A handgun was found near the 3-year-old. Neither of the other children sustained injuries. Robinson says the family was unaware that any weapons were in the home and suspect it may have belonged to the child's father. Describing the emotional loss the family is facing, Robinson said, \\"We can never get that back and his mother can never get that back—that's her only child and he's gone.\\" Robinson added, \\"Somebody should be held accountable.\\" \\"It’s a sad day for Cleveland,\\" Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said outside the home, located in the 3700 block of East 63rd Street. \\"A 1-year-old child lost his life.\\" Williams said the gun was unattended and police are investigating where the gun came from and how the child got ahold of it. \\"A 3-year-old can't be held accountable for a tragedy like this. There have to be adults that either supplied the weapons, had charge of the weapons or knew the weapons were there and didn't do anything to safeguard them,\\" Williams said. The victim, identified by the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's office as Braylon Robinson, died while being taken to the hospital. Williams said the incident calls for the community to look at ways to curb gun-related deaths, not just in Cleveland, but in the country. \\"This fascination we have with handguns, not just in the city, but in this country has to stop. This is a senseless loss of life in this city again,\\" Williams said. \\"It’s directly related to guns. We need to really take a hard look at the things that we’re doing out there on the state, local, and national level to get some of these guns out of our community.\\" The two relatives of the deceased child were released to their mother. So far, no charges have been filed. An investigation is ongoing. Meanwhile, the family says it is struggling with funeral-related expenses and has established a GoFundMe funeral account. --- Follow Bob Jones on Facebook and Twitter Follow @bobjonesTV --- Follow Michael Baldwin on Facebook and Twitter Follow @baldwinreports ||||| Write a summary.","response":"A 3-year-old boy in Cleveland found a gun in his house and accidentally shot his 1-year-old brother, Braylon Robinson, in the head, resulting in his death.

Paraphrasing is the process of rewording or rephrasing a statement in order to convey the same meaning using different words. Here, we can observe that both sentences are conveying the same information, despite some slight variations in the way they are structured. Let's break it down: 1. \\"Antrim County is a civil community of the Helena Township in the U.S. state of Michigan.\\" 2. \\"Antrim County is a civil township of Helena Township in the U.S. state of Michigan.\\" In both sentences, the main subject is \\"Antrim County,\\" and the statements imply that it is a part of a larger entity, namely the \\"Helena Township.\\" Additionally, both sentences specify that the location of these entities is within the United States, specifically in the state of Michigan. There is a slight difference in the way the relationship between Antrim County and Helena Township is described. In the first sentence, Antrim County is referred to as a \\"civil community\\" of Helena Township, while in the second sentence, it is called a \\"civil township.\\" However, this difference in wording doesn't drastically change the overall meaning of the statement. In both cases, it is clear that the writer wants to convey that Antrim County is a subordinate division within Helena Township in Michigan.

He is treating a patient with respiratory problem. He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would the air pressure inside lungs increase or decrease in state A? Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. A:","response":"The air pressure inside the lungs would decrease in state A.

While I was studying in my room the night before the test, Fred was watching TV. Fred usually worried a lot the night before a test. But on that night he looked perfectly calm. Thenhe told me of his plan. \\"It's very simple. There are a hundred questions and I have to get fifty correct to pass the test. I'll just toss the coin to decide the answers. That way, I'm sure I'll get half the questions right.\\" The next day, Fred came happily into the exam room. As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour he marked down his answers. Then he left, half an hour before the rest of us.

In an exclusive sit-down with 20/20, Keith Papini describes Sherri’s 22-day captivity including the moment she was thrust from a moving vehicle on Thanksgiving, the day she was discovered. “She was bound, she had a chain around her waist, that is correct, she had a bag over her head, that is correct,” Keith told ABC News’ Matt Gutman. “Her left hand was in the vehicle chained to something, she was chained anytime she was in a vehicle. They opened the door, she doesn’t know because she had a bag over her head, they cut something to free her restraint that was holding her into the vehicle and then, kind of, pushed her out of the vehicle,” Keith continued to detail of what his wife told him. Watch the 20/20 Interview Below: Sherri was allegedly kidnapped while out for a jog on Nov. 2. The mother of two was found around 4:30 a.m. Thanksgiving Day in Yolo County — about 150 miles south of her Redding home, where she was last seen. In a statement obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday, Keith explained the brutal condition his wife was in when he reunited with her for the first time. “My first sight was my wife in a hospital bed. Her face covered in bruises ranging from yellow to black because of her repeated beatings. The bridge of her nose broken,” he wrote. “She has been branded and I could feel the rise of her scabs under my fingers.” He also noted that she weighed only 87 lbs. and her long, blonde hair had been chopped off. During a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko revealed new details about the two Hispanic women who allegedly abducted Sherri. Sherri told investigators that one of the women had long curly hair, thin eyebrows and pierced ears, and the other woman, who was older, had straight black hair with gray and thick eyebrows. Both of the women allegedly spoke in Spanish the majority of the time. Bosenko said the alleged abductors had sometimes covered Sherri’s face and had concealed their own faces as well during her three-week ordeal. “Sherri did her best in providing the descriptions but was not able to provide a detailed description because of the assailants covering their faces,” Bosenko said. The motive behind the alleged kidnapping is still unclear as authorities continue to investigate.

The phrase could be interpreted in multiple ways. In one interpretation, \\"scalds like acid\\" could be seen as a negative comment, implying that the movie's emotional impact was so harsh and disturbing that it was similar to the effects of acid. This could mean that the reviewer found the movie to be uncomfortable, painful to watch, or overly intense in terms of its themes, visuals, or subject matter. In this case, the reviewer might have had a negative experience while watching the movie. On the other hand, the phrase could also be seen as a positive comment, meaning that the movie was so powerful, impactful, and emotionally resonant that it left a lasting impression on the reviewer, akin to the corrosive effects of acid. This interpretation suggests that the movie succeeded in leaving a deep, unforgettable mark on the viewer – a testament to the filmmaker's ability to create a captivating story, evoke strong emotions, or tackle complex issues. In this case, the reviewer would have had a positive experience with the movie. Without further context or information about the reviewer's overall opinion, it is impossible to determine whether the movie was seen positively or negatively based on the phrase \\"scalds like acid\\" alone.

Context: Though hooded and cloaked, Nicolette trembled. The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

Washington (CNN) -- Members of the Senate and House armed services committees currently are talking to the Pentagon about the next round of hearings on Afghanistan, trying to coordinate sessions with the U.S. commander there, Gen.

When Petraeus, probably the best-known military man in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, returns to answer questions, the television lights will shine on the four stars he wears on each shoulder. Now a new debate is swirling in Washington, thanks to an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal pushing for Petraeus to get a fifth star, like military giants of the past. In the halls of the","response":"Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, discussions have begun to emerge regarding whether or not Gen. David Petraeus, already a highly decorated and respected military leader, should be awarded a fifth star, a rank that would place him among the likes of historic military figures such as Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Proponents of the idea argue that Petraeus' outstanding leadership and strategic prowess, demonstrated during his tenures in both Iraq and Afghanistan, warrant this rare distinction. They believe that elevating him to a five-star general would not only recognize his exceptional service to the nation but also serve as a symbol of appreciation for all the brave men and women he has led in combat. On the other hand, opponents of the proposal contend that awarding Petraeus a fifth star could set a dangerous precedent, potentially opening the door for others to lobby for similar recognition in the future, regardless of their contributions to the military. They also express concerns about whether such recognition might politicize the military, as Petraeus is often seen as a figure not just representing the military, but also a broader foreign policy establishment. Ultimately, the decision will rest with Congress and the president, who hold the authority to bestow such an honor. In the meantime, the debate continues to gain traction as Gen. David Petraeus prepares for his upcoming hearings on the ongoing situation in Afghanistan. As the general steps into the limelight once more, the question of whether he deserves a fifth star will remain at the forefront of many observers' minds, awaiting resolution in the complex world of military achievements and political considerations."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home. For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains. From the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries. \\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement. It was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize. \\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \\"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\\" It was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague. The United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue. After the end of this story, Trump is probably: A. still taking a stroll with Kim Jong Un B. still thinks he and Kim Jong Un had chemistry. C. still signing the denuclearization agreement. D. not enough information Answer:","response":"B. still thinks he and Kim Jong Un had chemistry. From the information given in the task, one can deduce that President Trump still thinks that he and Kim Jong Un had chemistry. In the statements made by President Trump after the meeting, he emphasized on the chemistry between the two leaders. He mentioned, \\"We got along really well. We had a great chemistry. You understand how I feel about chemistry. It is very important. I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\\" Therefore, it can be inferred that President Trump still considers his rapport with Kim Jong Un favorably. One cannot accurately comment on options A and C based on the information provided in the task. Trump taking a stroll with Kim Jong Un is a part of the past summit event, yet there is no indication that it continued after their agreement was signed. Similarly, the collation about them signing the denuclearization agreement is a past event and does not provide any detail about whether it was an ongoing process. As for option D, while there may not be sufficient information concerning all elements of the narrative, we can logically infer that Trump most likely still thinks he had chemistry with Kim Jong Un based on his comments. Therefore, option D is not accurate for the current answer."},{"question":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = Cocum, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 3 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes.

Water bottles commonly fall within this size range. 3. The deposit amount is 10 cents per container, which has been in place since July 1, 2017.

The Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtably be far better than George Lucas' Star Wars \\"prequel\\" trilogy (Episodes 1-3) will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century! I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and I didn't quite understand the depth of the film at that time. Now that I have read the books, I understand what the whole storyline is all about. To be sure, some of the characters are quite silly, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)) but, I have to say it follows the book rather closely, and it goes into part of book two, The Two Towers. The good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it's time. The bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through The Two Towers without any result of Frodo's quest to destroy the one ring, and the animation looks quite dated compared to today's standards. Overall, not AS bad as many say it is. BUT, the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that matter! I'll take the animated version of Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter anyday!

The reviewer acknowledges some flaws and issues with the animated version of The Lord of the Rings, but also appreciates certain aspects of it, giving it a 7 out of 10.

Aged 19 at the time back in late 2010, and still living with his mum and dad in Somerset, Mr Nash had developed a website called Little Gossip, where schoolchildren could anonymously post news of interest to their fellow pupils. Mr Nash, now 25, says he had the best of intentions, but things very quickly went wrong. The website was an immediate viral hit, gaining 33,000 users in just its first hour, then hundreds of thousands across the length and breadth of the UK within a few days. Unfortunately, at least 10% of the comments posted were malicious. And amid accusations that it was a bullying free-for-all, schools and parents were soon loudly complaining. And Mr Nash was doorstepped by tabloid reporters and TV crews. Mr Nash says: \\"My mum walked out one morning in her dressing gown to open the front gate for someone, and suddenly there were reporters asking her, 'Does Ted Nash live here?' \\"She ran back inside, shouting to me, 'What have you done?'\\" With the story being widely reported across national UK newspapers, and on TV, Mr Nash shut down the website a few months later. A serial technology entrepreneur, who set up his first money-making website when he was just 12 years old, Mr Nash describes Little Gossip as \\"an unbelievable learning curve\\". He says: \\"As is more often the case, I came up with the idea for the website to solve my own problems. \\"At school I was always much more interested in building a company. Because of that I felt that I had missed out on a huge amount of gossip and socialising, so I thought something like Little Gossip would be very useful, and it was started with good intentions. \\"Unfortunately it was a sad state of affairs that you couldn't allow some people to be anonymous [without them abusing it], and we had to close it.\\" Now chief executive of a start-up technology company called Tapdaq, which aims to help small mobile phone apps more easily grow user numbers, Mr Nash is already 13 years into a busy and eventful business career. At 17 he made almost Â£3m when three million people around the world paid 99 cents to download an app he had developed called Face Rate, and then he subsequently spent 18 months helping Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper group, News UK, develop its mobile presence. But Mr Nash says it all started when, aged 12, and on a family holiday in Spain, he was inspired by an 18-year-old he met who had made a decent amount of money by developing an early internet search engine. \\"I saw all the material items that he had, and me being 12 I wanted that as well. \\"It completely set off a spark in my head, and from that point onwards I was just fascinated by technology and the impact it can have. And, of course, the money it can make. \\"At that age all I could think about was buying the next toy - literally. But [as] you get older you realise that the money is not so important, and that it is a subset for building something of value for other people to use.\\" Returning to the UK, Mr Nash set to work on learning how to build websites, and still just 12, was successful with one of the first ones he built. Called Rediz, it was an online shopping index, with links to shopping websites. Mr Nash was savvy enough to build up a user base, and he was soon getting paid by retailers for each customer who clicked through to their websites from his. \\"I was earning the kind of money that 12-year-olds shouldn't, but I had to get my parents to sign all my contracts, because I was obviously too young.\\" Many of Mr Nash's other websites, including an attempt at a search engine, were far less successful. He says: \\"From age 12 to 16, it was pretty much all trial and error. I built [metaphorically speaking] thousands of websites, the majority of which didn't see the light of day.\\" Support, advice and occasional investment along the way came from Steve Pankhurst, the founder of one-time UK social networking website Friends Reunited. Mr Nash had met Mr Pankhurst via his father. After Rediz, Mr Nash's next big hit was Face Rate, an app that measured - or at least tried to measure - how attractive a user was. It went viral, and Mr Nash says he \\"made an obscene amount of money for a kid of that age\\". The ignominy of Little Gossip then followed, before Mr Nash helped the Times and Sunday Times newspapers improve their digital presence. Mr Nash says his sole attention since 2013 has been London-based Tapdaq, which helps mobile phone apps cross-advertise on each other's platforms, thereby helping them to more easily build up user numbers. He says it has so far secured financial backing of 8m (Â£5.5m). The ambitious Mr Nash has high hopes for the company, which he says \\"could become a multibillion-dollar business\\". \\"For me being an entrepreneur is both a blessing and a curse,\\" he says. \\"I'm always thinking [of business ideas]. It keeps me awake at night.\\"","response":"A young man named Ted Nash made a website called Little Gossip for schoolchildren to share news, but it got too big and negative, so he closed it and started a new company called Tapdaq that helps small apps grow."},{"question":"You are given a sentence and a question in the input.

The review might look like this: Title: Disappointing Dining Experience - Tastytown Bistro My family and I recently decided to visit Tastytown Bistro after hearing a buzz about their much-acclaimed contemporary cuisine. Sadly, our eagerly anticipated dining experience turned out to be a major letdown, and I am compelled to express my dissatisfaction through this review. To begin with, we had booked a table in advance to avoid any inconvenience, but upon arrival, we were made to wait for 30 minutes as our table was occupied by another party. The staff seemed disorganized and had no clear solution for the situation. I understand that delays might happen, but the lack of proper communication and unfriendly attitude of the staff members added to our irritation. Once we got seated, we hoped our experience would improve. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It took another 20 minutes for someone to come to take our order. As we were a group of five with various preferences, we ordered a diverse range of items, from grilled fish to a vegetarian platter. However, the dishes took an exceedingly long time to be served, making us wonder about the efficiency of the kitchen staff. When the food arrived, we couldn't help but notice that the presentation was quite sloppy, a surprising discovery considering the restaurant's reputation. As tasting is the most crucial part, we held our breath and dug in, hoping to be swept away by flavors. To our dismay, the grilled fish was overcooked, making it dry and unappetizing, and the sauce accompanying it tasted bland, almost as if some key ingredients were omitted. Likewise, the vegetarian platter was a far cry from what we expected as the vegetables were over-salted, and their freshness seemed questionable. Apart from the disappointing food, the atmosphere didn't help either. The restaurant's ambiance was quite noisy, making it difficult to maintain a conversation. Furthermore, the tables were positioned too close to each other, leading to a lack of privacy during our meal. To add insult to injury, when the time came to pay the bill, we realized that the prices charged for the substandard quality of food and service we experienced were exorbitant. In conclusion, I regret to say that our dining experience at Tastytown Bistro was a complete disappointment. The food, service, and atmosphere were far from the upscale reputation that the restaurant claims to have. Given our experience, I cannot recommend Tastytown Bistro to anyone seeking a pleasant evening out with family or friends, and I sincerely hope that they take this feedback into consideration and work towards improving their establishment."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: At what lake in the area that has been covered by sea water at least seven times do nutrients quickly deteriorate? A vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present. Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod. Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as...

I miss My Waldorf Randm Girl","response":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"I miss My Waldorf Randm Girl,\\" we first need to break it down and analyze each of the components. Firstly, let's correct the typographical errors and capitalization issues to get a clearer understanding of the tweet: \\"I miss my Waldorf random girl.\\" Now, let's discuss each part of this tweet and understand the overall sentiment it conveys. 1. \\"I miss\\": The phrase \\"I miss\\" indicates a feeling of longing or nostalgia for something or someone who may have brought joy or happiness to the individual. It suggests that the user is expressing their desire to reconnect and is emotionally attached to the subject they're referring to. 2. \\"my\\": The use of \\"my\\" personalizes the sentiment and strengthens the emotional attachment, as it implies a unique and close relationship between the individual and the subject. 3. \\"Waldorf\\": This term could be referring to a location, a hotel, or even a school and serves as a contextual clue to where the individual might have met or interacted with the subject. It could trigger memories related to specific events or experiences, suggesting that meaningful moments were shared in that specific context. 4. \\"random\\": The word \\"random\\" signifies that the user may have encountered the subject unexpectedly or without any prior introduction. This word implies the serendipity of their meeting and adds a touch of whimsy or intrigue to the overall sentiment. 5. \\"girl\\": The final part of the tweet identifies the subject as a female. The absence of her name or a more specific description could indicate either a purposeful effort to withhold personal information or that their connection might have been fleeting.

The DVD disappoints because the stereo soundtrack has been created direct from the mixing desk without any effects, particularly on Stings vocals.

As for Betty, the world of binary codes, algorithms, and programming languages seemed like her natural habitat. She spent years honing her skills and immersing herself in the sea of computer knowledge. Due to her dedication and passion, Betty never needed to ask for help. It was clear that the two friends had different interests and talents, but that only made their bond stronger. Katrina, in her own way, was a bright and creative mind, and her talents lay elsewhere. She excelled in the realm of human interaction and had a gift for putting people at ease. Together, they complemented each other, like two pieces of a puzzle, balancing strengths and weaknesses. Katrina's inability to grasp computer concepts was never a problem. She never let her lack of knowledge discourage her. Instead, she embraced it and used it to strengthen her bond with Betty. Katrina cherished every moment when she could watch Betty work her magic — how her fingers danced gracefully on the keyboard, how her eyes sparkled when she figured out a solution to a seemingly impossible problem. Being the supportive friend that she was, Betty didn't mind assisting Katrina with her computer issues. In fact, she enjoyed the opportunity to share her passion with someone who genuinely appreciated her expertise. Betty took the time to patiently explain even the simplest of concepts, taking pride in teaching her friend the ins and outs of technology. On the other hand, Katrina was more than happy to learn from Betty. She started from the basics, understanding the fundamentals of how a computer worked, making slow but steady progress. As time passed, Katrina gained confidence in her newfound skills, and while she was nowhere near close to Betty's level of expertise, it was still a significant accomplishment. Countless afternoons spent together turned into something more profound than mere knowledge-sharing sessions. The friendship between Katrina and Betty flourished like never before. Gradually, the line between helping out and spending quality time together seemed to blur. Their connection spilled over to other aspects of their lives as well. With Betty's unyielding support, Katrina embraced her creative side, experimenting with various artistic mediums such as painting, sketching, and graphic design. Katrina discovered a way to combine her newly acquired computer skills with her innate creativity, unleashing an entirely new avenue of self-expression. On the flip side, Katrina's emotional intelligence helped Betty become more in tune with her own feelings and those of others around her. As someone who had always found solace in the black and white certainty of computer code, Betty was initially uncomfortable navigating the abstract world of emotions. However, under Katrina's guidance, she learned to recognize and appreciate the importance of emotional intelligence in both her personal and professional life. In conclusion, while it was true that Katrina couldn't even use a search engine to begin with and it seemed like Betty never needed to ask for help when it came to computers, their journey of support and learning from one another led to invaluable personal growth and a deep, everlasting friendship. Together, they defied the boundaries of knowledge and embraced the beauty and depth of human connection."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Sethe is a former slave living on the outskirts of Cincinnati shortly after the Civil War.

A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.\\" Answer: A:","response":"Metz was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. In the given context, the historical role and strategic importance of Metz are evident, particularly during the Franco-Prussian War, which lasted from July 19, 1870 to May 10, 1871. The war was a major conflict between the French Empire, led by Napoleon III, and the North German Confederation, led by the Kingdom of Prussia. Metz was known for its strong fortifications, which played a significant role during the Franco-Prussian War. The Siege of Metz took place between August and October 1870 and was a major event during the war. The city was heavily defended by French forces under Marshal Francois Achille Bazaine. However, the Prussian forces, led by Prince Friedrich Karl, managed to surround and besiege the city. The significance of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe's oppidum, Metz, was further emphasized during the Battle of Sedan, which occurred in September 1870. The French Army of Châlons, reinforced by the French Marines and naval infantry intended for invasion of northern Germany, suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Prussian forces, led by Helmuth von Moltke. The defeat was so severe that it led to the capture of Napoleon III and most of the professional French army. Faced with the desperate situation, the French government turned to inexperienced reservists of the Garde Mobile and naval officers to fill the void of leadership created by the capture of most of their professional army. The situation worsened as the autumn storms of the North Sea impacted the French navy's blockade of the north German ports. Unable to maintain the blockade, the French navy retreated to ports along the English Channel, where it remained in port for the rest of the war. Metz, as the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe, serves as an essential geographical and historical indicator of the strategic challenges faced by the French forces during the Franco-Prussian War. The challenges highlight the importance of controlling crucial locations, such as Metz, in the context of military strategy and the attempt to gain leverage over the enemy. The French setbacks in Metz and Sedan ultimately contributed to their eventual defeat in the war and the dramatic reshaping of European politics that followed."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a statement, and three sentences as choices.

Article: We are always using body language in our daily life. When we have a conversation with someone, we may be using more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe it means 'He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head'. In our Chinese culture, nodding our head up and down means 'yes' and shaking our head from side to side means 'no'. However, in parts of India, Greece and Turkey, it means just the opposite . In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means 'You're all right or Everything is OK'. However, if we do this in France or Belgium, it means 'You're worth zero'. In Greece or Turkey, we should not make this gesture . Or we are thought to be very rude. The meaning of gestures can also change over time. In the 1960s, the V sign meant 'peace'. However, during World War II, it meant 'victory'. In Greece, it is a very insulting sign. Though the meaning of body language is different, there are some expressions having the same meaning throughout the world, such as smiling and crying.

However, if we had to assign a rating based on this limited information, I would suggest giving it a ★★ rating. This is because, without any substantial information on the reviewer's experience, it is impossible to determine how satisfied or dissatisfied the reviewer might be. Assigning a ★★ rating serves as a middle ground between a completely negative (★) and a highly positive rating (★★★★★), which acknowledges that the review does not provide enough information for a definite rating. Ideally, a helpful review should include specific details about the product or service, such as its features, how it performs, its value for money, comparisons to similar products, and any important issues that a potential buyer might want to know.

Input: Question: How old was John Caulfield when he was appointed Cork City's manager? Passage:McNulty moved to Cork City in 2003, initially playing for the club's under-21 side in the Eircom U21 League. In 2005, he was promoted to the first team and made 3 appearances in the league, as City won the league title. McNulty made a further 24 league appearances over the next 4 seasons. In 2010, as Cork City were relegated to the First Division due to financial issues, McNulty established himself as City's starting goalkeeper, making 33 league appearances that season, as City finished in 6th place. He made 29 league appearances in 2011, as City secured promotion back to the Premier Division by winning the league. McNulty continued as City's first choice keeper, missing just 5 league matches in 2012 and 2013. Ahead of the 2014 season, John Caulfield was appointed as Cork City's manager. McNulty made 33 league appearances that season as City finished 2nd in the league to Dundalk. He played in all of Cork City's league matches over the next two seasons, as City finished 2nd to Dundalk on both occasions. McNulty also started the 2015 FAI Cup Final as City were beaten 1-0 after extra time thanks to a goal from Richie Towell. In the 2016 FAI Cup Final, McNulty again started the final, and was on the winning side this time, as Sean Maguire's goal in the last minute of extra time secured a 1-0 win for City. In 2017, McNulty played in all but one of City's league matches, as City won the league title. In the third successive cup final between Cork City and Dundalk, McNulty started the final and saved a penalty from Michael Duffy in a penalty shootout that City eventually won 5-3, after the match finished 1-1 after extra time, to secure a league and cup double for the first time in City's history.

In the third quarter, the Titans continued its domination with Bironas kicking a 43-yard field goal, while rookie RB Chris Henry got a 4-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Houston began to rally as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson and a 6-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter.

Hypothesis: Information security is best handled on an ad hoc basis. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In fact, it directly contradicts the premise. The premise is stating that information security is so important that it cannot be managed or addressed in a sporadic, unstructured, or unplanned manner, which is what it means if something is being done on an ad hoc basis. It is asserting that due to its importance, information security requires strategies, planning, and conceptualization that go beyond the scope of ad hoc responses. The premise implies that the role of information security is too crucial for handling through isolated solutions or interventions that haven't been previously organized, researched, or thought out. On the other hand, the hypothesis is proposing the opposite idea: that information security is best addressed in an ad hoc way, meaning on a case by case, as-needed basis without an underlying structure, plan, or protocol in place. It argues for a method that the premise explicitly dismisses as inappropriate or insufficient for dealing with the matter of information security. Therefore, there's a clear disagreement between the premise and the hypothesis. The hypothesis is advancing a perspective that directly opposes the perspective in the premise. Hence, the hypothesis cannot be said to be entailed, or logically follow, from the premise. They represent two opposing stances on how information security should be approached and managed. A hypothesis that would be entailed by the given premise could be, for example: \\"A well-structured, thought-out and consistent strategy is necessary for handling information security.\\""},{"question":"Definition: Given a sentence, generate a most unlikely next statement.

Options: - picnic - friend's house - table - space shuttle - fairgrounds Reasoning process:","response":"To find the most reasonable answer, let's examine each option and determine the context and likely settings. 1. Picnic - A picnic usually implies an outdoor gathering with food, potentially at a park or open area. While it is possible that \\"the big game\\" could refer to some kind of sports match, it's uncommon for people to gather at a picnic to watch such events as they generally require a screen or TV to watch them. 2. Friend's house - In this context, the big game typically refers to a sports event, such as football, basketball, or soccer. People often gather at a friend's house to watch these games on television while enjoying food and company. It's also mentioned that he wasn't hosting, possibly making a friend's house the answer here. 3. Table - This option doesn't fit the context well, as a table is commonplace and does not uniquely provide a setting where a group of people would gather specifically to watch the big game. 4. Space shuttle - A space shuttle is an unlikely location for people to gather for the big game since it's not a typical or practical setting for watching sports events. 5. Fairgrounds - Although fairgrounds are large gathering places for events, they are generally not used for watching popular sports games. Furthermore, given that he has brought food with him, it implies a more casual or informal gathering rather than a large public event. Based on this reasoning, the most reasonable answer is that he brought plenty of food with him to his friend's house. This setting typically aligns with watching the big game together and aligns with the information that he wasn't hosting the event."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water - Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage. Question: suppose You haven't gotten your flu shot happens, how will it affect IMPROVED safety from flooding. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"C: no effect The flu shot and safety from flooding are unrelated events and factors. A flu shot is a vaccine that helps protect individuals from contracting the influenza virus, while the safety from flooding concerns the measures taken to ensure that an area prone to floods is better protected and managed. The process described initially outlines how a dam functions to help mitigate the risks associated with flooding by controlling the water levels in a river. Building a dam, managing its floodgates, and properly releasing floodwater is crucial for improving the safety of an area prone to floods. Whether or not someone has gotten their flu shot has no bearing on the effectiveness of these flood control measures. A person's immunization status does not influence the construction, maintenance, or operation of a dam in any manner, and therefore, it does not impact the improved safety from flooding in an area with a dam. While it is always advisable for people to take proper precautions and get their flu shots to maintain personal health, this action will not have any direct effect on flood control measures and the safety of the community from flooding.

It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. Now, I have a new situation: Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks. Answer this question please: Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries?","response":"Based on the information provided, Robert is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of his arteries. This is because he only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, whereas Michael has been following the recommendation to exercise regularly every week. Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol (the \\"bad\\" cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (the \\"good\\" cholesterol). By not exercising as frequently, Robert may have a higher risk of LDL cholesterol build-up, which can lead to atherosclerosis and potentially increase the risk of heart attack or stroke."},{"question":"The anemone was being harvested for sale in New York, where was it likely taken from? Options: - tide pool - nursery - michigan - atlantic ocean - ocean floor Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"To determine where the anemone was likely taken from for sale in New York, let's examine each option in detail: 1. Tide pool: Anemones, particularly sea anemones, can be found in tide pools in intertidal zones. In these areas, marine life is exposed at low tides and submerged at high tides. An assortment of plants and animals inhabit tide pools, including sea anemones, which can latch onto rocks and survive waves. Anemones are found in tide pools worldwide, but it is not clear if the one in question was harvested from a tide pool or not. 2. Nursery: This option refers to a human-made facility that cultivates and cares for marine and aquatic life. A nursery could be part of an aquarium, research institution, or a private business involved in breeding, raising, and selling marine life. Some anemones could be sourced from nurseries to ensure sustainability and regulation of species and populations. It is plausible that the anemone was taken from a nursery. 3. Michigan: This location does not provide enough context to determine if the anemone was harvested from here. Michigan is a US state with some freshwater habitats, but anemones are mostly marine creatures. However, as we're not sure if this refers to a specific location or a company, we cannot confirm if the anemone was taken from Michigan or not. 4. Atlantic Ocean: The Atlantic Ocean is a vast marine habitat where numerous species of sea anemones can be found. However, as a location, it is too broad to determine if the anemone being harvested was specifically taken from the Atlantic Ocean or not. Furthermore, it is ecologically and financially unsustainable to harvest anemones directly from the ocean for sale. 5. Ocean floor: Sea anemones can be found at various depths in the ocean, depending on the species. Some can be found in shallow waters, while others may inhabit deeper regions near the ocean floor. Although the ocean floor could be a potential source for anemones, harvesting from the ocean floor directly might not be an environmentally responsible practice. Based on the information provided, it seems that either a tide pool or a nursery would be the most likely sources for harvesting anemones: - A tide pool could be a sustainable and easily accessible source for anemones, but the connection to New York is not explicitly stated. - A nursery could offer anemones bred and raised in controlled environments specifically for sale and distribution in various locations, including New York. Without knowing the specific species, context, or adhered process, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact source. However, given the concerns for conservation and sustainability, it would be more likely that the anemone was taken from a nursery."},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who claims that most of the money spent came from the band's own funds? is inside the article: The vocals were taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991, the first time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was involved in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, \\"We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top.\\" On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: \\"Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung\\".In July 1991, Creation agreed to relocate the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records was unable to pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment. Dutt recalled, \\"I don't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out.\\" Shields' unpredictable behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect on Creation's finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later said he had been desperate to leave the project, while Creation's second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown. Green recalled, \\"It was two years into the album, and I phoned Shields up in tears. I was going 'You have to deliver me this record'.\\"Shields and Butcher became afflicted with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for further weeks while they recovered.

For John Edwards, a former US Senator from North Carolina and two-time presidential candidate, that moment came during the 2008 presidential campaign. Though marred by controversy, it was an opportunity for Edwards to showcase his resilience and commitment to the values he epitomized. Early Career and Political Ascendance Born in 1953, John Edwards grew up in a modest, working-class environment that helped shape his worldview and political perspectives. After earning a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Edwards quickly gained recognition as a successful trial lawyer, advocating for victims of corporate negligence and malpractice. As his legal career provided him with a strong platform for public service, Edwards transitioned into politics, winning a North Carolina Senate seat in 1998. The young politician's charm, charisma, and genuine concern for the working class made him an instant Democratic Party star. His advocacy for affordable healthcare, the fight against poverty, and the expansion of educational opportunities resonated with many Americans. This catapulted him into the national spotlight, and Edwards found himself as the vice-presidential nominee alongside John Kerry in the 2004 US presidential election. Despite their loss to incumbent President George W. Bush, the political future seemed bright for John Edwards. 2008 Presidential Campaign and A Moment of Truth In the 2008 presidential election, John Edwards launched his second bid for the presidency, hoping to capitalize on his growing popularity and the momentum of the Democratic Party. However, the presence of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the race overshadowed his efforts, despite Edwards' consistent efforts to remain a strong voice for average Americans. Controversy and scandal also threatened to derail his campaign as the media caught wind of an extramarital affair Edwards had while his wife, Elizabeth, fought breast cancer. However, in the face of adversity, Edwards remained committed to his message of economic equality, promising to keep fighting on behalf of the voiceless. This perseverance exemplified his determination to overcome the odds and continue in public service, despite the challenges. Ultimately, John Edwards' presidential campaign did not succeed, but it served as a vital moment of truth for him. By staying true to his beliefs and remaining persistent in the face of adversity, he demonstrated the qualities that made him such an influential figure in American politics. Aftermath and Impact on American Politics Edwards' political career eventually came to a halt, and he returned to his roots in law. However, his impact on American politics did not fade away entirely. His focus on economic inequality and healthcare reform laid a foundation for later Democratic politicians to build upon. Moreover, his insistence on remaining in the race amid personal scandal demonstrated the importance of resilience and addressing public issues regardless of one's personal life. By refusing to abandon his principles, even during the most challenging times, John Edwards cemented his position as an American political figure who deeply cared about the issues that mattered to the average citizen. Though his moment of truth may not have been as glorious as he hoped, it highlighted his unwavering resolve to serve and advocate for a progressive vision of America. Conclusion For John Edwards, his moment of truth during the 2008 presidential campaign was not marked by victory or defeat, but instead by the steadfast pursuit of the values he cherished. Despite personal controversy and political setbacks, Edwards maintained his position as a champion for social justice, healthcare reform, and economic equality. Though his political career waned, the legacy of his convictions will continue to shape the American political landscape for years to come."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: Bandeja paisa, ingredient, Fried egg","response":"The delectable Bandeja Paisa, a traditional Colombian dish, boasts a mouthwatering medley of ingredients including the perfectly fried egg, which flawlessly complements the ensemble of tantalizing flavors, textures, and aromas that make this meal an unforgettable experience for your taste buds."},{"question":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Dragons are not real animals, but look like a combination of many animals such as snakes, fish and deer.

The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked., what would be the answer ?

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease.

Here is a brief explanation of the other options, and why they are not suitable for addressing the issue of low humidity in your house: B. Surface of the earth: The surface of the Earth has no direct bearing on the humidity levels inside your home. While certain geographic locations may inherently have higher or lower levels of humidity, the surface of the Earth itself does not provide a solution to the issue of low humidity in your house. C. Skating rink: A skating rink is designed for recreational ice-skating activities and typically has no connection to the humidity levels inside a residential property. While the presence of ice in a skating rink might suggest higher humidity levels due to the natural evaporation of water, this does not directly translate to a suitable solution for low humidity in your house. D. Ice cube: An ice cube is frozen water that, when melted, adds a negligible amount of moisture to the air. It is not a practical or efficient solution for increasing humidity levels in a room or an entire house, especially considering the short-lived nature of an ice cube as it melts. E. Burn it to the ground: Burning your house down would not only be an extreme and irreversible measure, but it would also not address the issue of low humidity. While the fire would produce moisture in the air due to the combustion process, it would also create a myriad of other problems, including the total destruction of your home and potential danger to the surrounding area and individuals. In conclusion, out of the options listed, a humidifier (Option A) is the most practical and effective solution for increasing humidity levels in your house and making it a more comfortable environment for its occupants."},{"question":"Definition: A text is given in Oriya.

A basic subject-verb-object sentence structure will be a good starting point. Now, let's identify who could be the subject in this context. Since we are talking about inspecting crops in a field, a suitable subject would be a farmer. So, our subject will be \\"The farmer\\". Next, we need a verb that incorporates the concept of \\"inspect\\". An appropriate verb here would be \\"inspects,\\" since it relates to the subject and conveys the action of examining something closely. Finally, we need an object which should include the concepts of \\"crop\\" and \\"field\\". A combination like \\"the crops in the field\\" would be a suitable object that represents both concepts. Now, let's put all the parts together to form the complete sentence: \\"The farmer inspects the crops in the field.\\" This sentence successfully incorporates all the given concepts (crop, field, and inspect) while also maintaining a simple and coherent structure."},{"question":"Please write a short summary for the following article: White Lies bring death back to pop music Neil McCormick Last Updated: 12:53PM GMT 30 Jan 2009 White Lies: death is uplifting too The number one album this week is the debut from three-piece indie sensations White Lies with the cheerful title To Lose My Life. They play a kind of epic, gloomy, Eighties-inflected, synth-and-guitar music, somewhere between the throbbing, monotone new wave of Joy Division and the stadium anthems of U2. Their favourite subject matter is spelt out on the opening track, Death, in which singer Harry McVeigh contemplates the inevitability of his demise and confesses, with baritone anguish: \\"This fear's got a hold on me.\\" On the title track, he begs his lover to \\"grow old together and die at the same time\\", but winds up weeping at a chapel door, with his \\"dead love buried beneath the mud\\". But the song that really strikes the message home is Unfinished Business, in which the narrator tries to soothe his distraught, hysterical girlfriend. As events proceed, it slowly dawns on him (and us) that she can't hear him because he is dead. Worse, it's his lover who has killed him. Still, his ghost vainly tries to comfort his murderer, while white smoke fills his vision and a disembodied voice beckons him away. Lyricist and bassist Charles Cave is 20 years old, and not, presumably, in any imminent danger of meeting his maker. \\"The thought of not being around really scares me,\\" he says. \\"When I was a kid, I used to freak out.\\" Now he writes songs about it, which a lot of other kids are buying. \\"Death has a pretty depressing lyric, but it's uplifting, too, because it can help people feel it's all right to think and worry about these things. It's about finding solace in introspective thought. I've been a worrier since I was about seven, which used to keep me up at night. But not now.\\" I can relate to this because I was prone to similar morbid night panics as a child. And I was obsessed with death songs, from the jealous murder of Tom Jones's Delilah to Terry Jacks's self-pitying Seasons in the Sun, in which the dying narrator bids farewell to his loved ones. I was much taken with Johnny Cash's version of The Long Dark Veil, a sort of musical ancestor of White Lies' Unfinished Business, in which a wrongly executed man watches the woman who mourns him from beyond the grave. The song that loomed largest in my imagination, however, was Georgie Fame's ripe, jazzy version of the blues classic St James Infirmary, in which the narrator contemplates the corpse of his beloved (\\"so pale, so cold, so fair\\"), declares his own readiness to die, sets out his funeral plans and (while a juicy horn section lets loose) pleads with an unresponsive God to let his baby go. It gets about as close to the real experience of grief (incredulity, anger, resignation) that as it is possible for a song to do. Murder ballads and death songs have been a staple of folk music since time immemorial, traditions strongly upheld in blues and country, but it is perhaps surprising to consider that modern popular music is rife with songs about death. And it is not just in the margins, or the work of introspective singer-songwriters. From Eminem's murderous Stan to James Blunt's overwrought Goodbye My Lover, from P Diddy and Faith Evans's Missing You to Eric Clapton's Tears in Heaven, death sells records. Elton John's Diana tribute, Candle in the Wind is still the bestselling single of all time. After love and dancing, mortality may well be the next most common subject for lyricists. Genres such as the prosaically named death metal, black metal and gangsta rap revel in (usually violent) death, but the same strands of morbid fascination can be found in earlier, apparently more innocent times. In the late Fifties and early Sixties, a genre of teen death songs proliferated, with hundreds of tragic ditties appearing, usually centred on terrible accidents separating young lovers, from Ricky Valance's Tell Laura I Love Her to the Shangri Las' Leader of the Pack. The dawning realisation of your own mortality is a big psychological challenge for young people, and perhaps a pop song is a safe forum for such thoughts, where ideas and feelings can be examined at the remove of fiction. The subtext of many pop songs about death is that, while life is temporary, love is forever, making mortality less terminal. In many respects, that is not so different from contemporary death-fixated genres such as goth and emo. Self harm and suicide pepper the lyrics of bands such as My Chemical Romance, to the alarm of many parents. Yet a 2006 report from Sussex University suggested goths were more likely than their peers to be well-adjusted, attend university, favour a classical education and end up in a respectable profession. At the other end of a career from debutantes White Lies, 59-year-old rock legend Bruce Springsteen's new album, Working on a Dream, is released this week. And, amid the songs of love and hope, there are intimations of mortality, made most specific on the elegiac tribute to his late keyboard player, Danny Federici, The Last Carnival. Talking on BBC Radio, Springsteen made some astute observations about the strong connection between rock and death. \\"Rock music,\\" he said, \\"is set in the eternal present. For me, when I was younger, its primary message was 'live now'. It was a deep breath of the present. \\"There's an idea that you could perhaps run away from time. It's in most great rock music because the very desperateness of the present-ness immediately tells you, 'Oh, there's something else, my friend.' \\"And, for me, I hear death in all those early Elvis Presley records, those great early spooky blues records, records made by young kids. It's in Thunder Road [an early Springsteen song], the sense of passage of time, the passage of innocence, it cuts through all pop music.\\" Because it is the train we are all riding, The Mystery Train young Elvis sang about back in 1956, takes us on a journey into the unknown, never to return, bound for the greatest mystery of all. And we might as well have a song to sing on our way there. Except in Elvis's version, the long, black train actually brings his baby back. In pop music, love usually conquers death. Contrary to rumours, it appears the Devil may not actually have all the best tunes. Summary:","response":"The band, White Lies, which is made up of three musicians, has a new album that's very popular this week. It's called \\"To Lose My Life\\". Their music is kind of serious and big, like some music from the 1980's, and it makes people think about serious things like life and death. The singer in the band, Harry McVeigh, sings a lot about death and being scared of it. But even though the songs might seem a bit scary, they could also make people feel better about being afraid of those things. The band's songs are not the only ones about death. It seems that many people like songs about death, even though it's a sad topic. Songs about death have been popular for a long time in many types of music. Sometimes, those songs can help us think about important things in life. So next time you listen to music, don't be surprised if you hear a song about these topics!"},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems.

Given the context: How would you describe Jesse? Possible answers: a good planner, thoughtless and stupid, a bad planner","response":"Based on the given context, it is evident that Jesse can be described as a good planner. Jesse thought twice about their decision, which demonstrates their determination to analyze a situation diligently and thoroughly. They took into consideration all the relevant facts, indicating their commitment to making well-informed choices and weighing the consequences of their actions. A good planner is someone who meticulously assesses their options, contemplates various possible outcomes, and strategizes for potential difficulties that they may encounter. Jesse's approach to decision-making encompasses these qualities, as they sought to avoid making rash judgments without evaluating the entirety of the situation. It is important to acknowledge that even though Jesse is a good planner, they may still face unforeseen challenges or obstacles in their endeavors. The fact that they think carefully about their choices, however, is likely to leave them better-equipped to handle such situations. This proactive approach to problem-solving and commitment to understanding the potential implications of their decisions is an indication of a strong planner. In contrast, thoughtless and stupid individuals often make decisions impulsively, without taking the time to reflect on potential consequences or explore alternative options. They are not likely to consider relevant facts or weigh the pros and cons of their actions. It may lead them to poor decision-making, which can have negative repercussions on their personal or professional lives. A bad planner might have some semblance of a plan but could lack the foresight and attention to detail required to execute it effectively. They may neglect crucial aspects of a task or struggle to adapt when faced with unexpected challenges. Their lack of planning may also hinder their ability to achieve long-term goals. Through a careful examination of Jesse's approach to decision-making, it is clear that they do not exhibit the characteristics typically associated with being thoughtless and stupid or a bad planner. By considering all of the facts and taking the time to reflect on their choices, Jesse displays the hallmarks of a good planner who is dedicated to making informed decisions that align with their interests and goals."},{"question":"the chief executive of fannie mae, franklin raines, and its chief financial officer, j. timothy howard, were allowed to resign from the organization.

For example, at least three feet should be available behind each dining chair. Try to limit yourself to only one piece of oversized furniture in a single room. Too many and it will look crowded and cheap. When you arrange the seating in the room, it should appear open and inviting when standing at the entrance to the room (or at least the main entrance).

When place seating in an area that will be used for conversation, such as living room furniture, you should be careful not to put the items too far apart or too close together.

Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi (Nu'aymi) and \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani (Humayqani) were named as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. Nu'aymi was designated for providing financial support to al-Qa'ida, Asbat al-Ansar, al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and al-Shabaab, and Humayqani was designated for providing financial support to and acting on behalf of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). \\"It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qa'ida and its affiliates are concerned. We will continue to work with our partners in the Gulf to ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence in the region or elsewhere,\\" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. Nu'aymi is a Qatar-based terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade. He was considered among the most prominent Qatar-based supporters of Iraqi Sunni extremists. Humayqani has used his Yemen-based charity as a cover for funneling financial support to AQAP and has frequently traveled throughout the Arabian Peninsula while conducting business for AQAP. During political unrest in Yemen, Humayqani reportedly assisted AQAP in gaining a foothold and safe haven in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen and as of mid-2011 served as the acting AQAP amir there. Both Nu'aymi and Humayqani are at the center of global support networks that fund and facilitate terrorism. As a result of today's designation, any assets these individuals may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them. 'Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi In 2013, Nu'aymi ordered the transfer of nearly 600,000 to al-Qa'ida via al-Qa'ida's representative in Syria, Abu-Khalid al-Suri, and intended to transfer nearly 50,000 more. Nu'aymi has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders and Qatar-based donors. Nu'aymi reportedly oversaw the transfer of over 2 million per month to al-Qa'ida in Iraq for a period of time. He also served as an interlocutor between these Qatari nationals and al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders. Between 2003 and 2004, Nu'aymi provided support to the Iraqi insurgency more broadly and served as a conduit for their broadcast materials to media outlets. Nu'aymi as of mid-2012 provided approximately 250,000 to two U.S.-designated al-Shabaab figures, Mukhtar Robow and Sheikh Hassan Aweys Ali, the latter of whom is also designated by the United Nations (UN). Also in 2012, Nuaymi provided financial support to a charity headed by Yemen-based Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, who channeled funding to AQAP. \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani In his capacity as the head of a Yemen-based charity, Humayqani has used his status in the charitable community to fundraise and has provided some of that funding to AQAP and has facilitated financial transfers from AQAP supporters in Saudi Arabia to Yemen in support of AQAP operations. As of 2012, Humayqani was an important figure within AQAP and reportedly had a relationship with important AQAP leaders. Humayqani and others in March 2012 reportedly orchestrated an AQAP attack on a Yemeni Republican Guard base in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen. The attack employed multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and killed seven. He is suspected to have recruited individuals to AQAP who were involved in a plot to assassinate Yemeni officials. Humayqani has provided financial support and other services to AQAP and acted for or on behalf of the group. He has represented AQAP in meetings with Yemeni officials to negotiate the release of Yemeni soldiers held by AQAP and worked with AQAP operatives to coordinate the movement of AQAP fighters within Yemen. Humayqani has directed a group of armed AQAP associates that intended to carry out attacks on Yemeni government facilities and institutions, including a Yemeni government building in al-Bayda Governorate. He has also recruited individuals in Sana, Yemen on behalf of AQAP in support of AQAP efforts in southern Yemen. Along with the U.S. and UN designated cleric Shaykh Abd al-Majid al-Zindani, he has issued religious guidance in support of AQAP operations. Humayqani and AQAP leadership have planned to establish a new political party in Yemen, which AQAP planned to use as a cover for the recruitment and training of fighters and a means to attract broader support. AQAP leadership decided that Humayani would play a public role as a leader and spokesman for the new political party.

The 59-year-old educator had a stellar résumé that included extensive fundraising experience and years of work with international human rights groups. But one apparent accomplishment was omitted from the list: According to U.S. officials, Nu’aymi also was working secretly as a financier for al-Qaeda, funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist group’s affiliates in Syria and Iraq even as he led campaigns in Europe for greater freedoms for Muslims. Nu’aymi was one of two men identified by Treasury Department officials last week as major financial backers of al-Qaeda and its regional chapters across the Middle East. Although U.S. officials routinely announce steps to disrupt terrorist financing networks, the individuals named in the latest case are far from ordinary. Both men have served as advisers to government-backed foundations in Qatar and have held high-profile positions with international human rights groups. The second man, a Yemeni, is heavily involved in his country’s U.S.-backed political transition. Their alleged dual roles — promoting humanitarian causes and civil rights while simultaneously supporting extremist groups — reflect a growing challenge for counterterrorism officials attempting to monitor the torrents of cash flowing to Islamist rebel groups in Syria, current and former U.S. officials say. “Individuals with one foot in the legitimate world and another in the realm of terrorist financing provide al-Qaeda with a cloak of legitimacy,” said Juan Zarate, a former Treasury Department official and author of “Treasury’s Wars,” a book that describes U.S. efforts to penetrate terrorist financial networks. Zarate said such cases greatly complicate the “financial diplomacy” involved in attempting to disrupt terrorist support networks, especially private funding from wealthy Persian Gulf donors seeking to help Syria’s rebels. Despite attempts by gulf states to crack down on jihadist financial networks, former and current U.S. officials have described a surge in private support for Islamist extremists in Syria, particularly in Qatar and Kuwait. The Obama administration has repeatedly urged both countries to rein in private donations to jihadists, while acknowledging that new tactics, including the widespread use of Twitter and other social media, make fundraising more difficult to track. “It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qaeda and its affiliates are concerned,” David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in announcing financial restrictions against Nu’aymi and the Yemeni national, Abd al-Wahhab al-Humayqani. Cohen said the Obama administration would continue to work with the gulf region’s capitals to “ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence.” The administration’s action last week named both men as “specially designated global terrorists,” a determination that allows U.S. officials to freeze their financial assets and bar American citizens and companies from doing business with them. Treasury Department documents alleged that both men used their charity work to conceal efforts to raise millions of dollars for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, from Syria to the Horn of Africa. The naming of the two officials raised eyebrows in Qatar and Yemen, where supporters viewed the allegations as politically motivated. Both men have been prominent critics of U.S. counter­terrorism policies, particularly the use of drone strikes against terrorism suspects. Nu’aymi, a Qatar University professor and former president of the Qatar Football Association, was a founding member of a prominent charity — the Sheik Eid bin Mohammad al-Thani Charitable Foundation, named for a member of the country’s ruling family. In recent years, Nu’aymi had gained renown as an international activist, serving as president of Alkarama, a Geneva-based human rights organization that works closely with the United Nations and major international activist groups to advocate for Muslims’ civil rights. Alkarama lobbies on behalf of Islamist detainees around the world, and it accuses Western and Arab governments of suppressing the rights of political groups that promote Islamic rule for the Middle East. Recently, the group has spoken out against U.S. drone strikes. Some of the group’s former clients are linked to Islamist militias seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Humayqani is an Alkarama founding member and onetime adviser to Qatar on charitable giving, according to his résumé. He is a founding member of Yemen’s conservative Rashad Union party and has served on the country’s National Dialogue Conference, a group established in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising to advise the government on political and economic reforms. The U.S. government strongly backs the National Dialogue with political and financial support. Nu’aymi, in a response posted on Twitter last week, said the U.S. allegations were in retaliation for his criticism of American policies, including drone strikes in Yemen and U.S. support for the recent overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected government. He said the U.S. claims about his fundraising work were “far from the truth.” Humayqani was traveling and could not be reached for comment. A statement released by his Rashad Union party condemned what it called “false accusations” by the United States and urged Yemen’s government to rally to his defense. The allegations against Nu’aymi come at a time of increasing U.S. concern about the role of Qatari individuals and charities in supporting extreme elements within Syria’s rebel alliance. One charity, Madid Ahl al-Sham, was cited by Jabhat al-Nusra in August as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group, which has pledged loyalty to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

[ii] notebook was daunting..","response":"calendar was daunting. To increase her productivity, she started writing a to-do list in a daily notebook and threw away her calendar because the calendar was daunting. The calendar had become an overwhelming visual representation of her tasks, deadlines, and obligations. By constantly reminding her of everything she needed to accomplish, it was creating a sense of anxiety and stress that was more hindering than helpful. Switching to a daily notebook not only helped her avoid the intimidating sight of an overly packed calendar, but it also provided several other benefits. For one, the notebook offered greater flexibility in organizing her tasks and priorities. She could separate her to-do list into different categories, such as personal, work-related, and long-term goals. This made it easier for her to focus on one area at a time without feeling overwhelmed by unrelated tasks. In addition to allowing for better organization, the daily notebook also encouraged her to break down tasks into more manageable steps. Instead of having a large, vague task looming over her on the calendar, she could write detailed action items in her notebook and cross each one off as she completed them. This approach gave her a greater sense of accomplishment and made her feel more in control of her workload. Despite the benefits of using a daily notebook for her to-do list, she discovered that it was important to implement some strategies to make it as effective as possible. Here are some tips that she found helpful in maximizing her productivity: 1. Prioritize tasks: By categorizing her to-do list items based on importance and urgency, she could focus on what truly mattered. This helped her avoid the trap of \\"busy work\\" and ensured she was making meaningful progress on her goals. 2. Set time estimates: Adding a time estimate for each task gave her an idea of how long it should take to complete, making it easier to plan her day and allocate time efficiently. 3. Review and update regularly: At the beginning and end of each day, she made sure to review her list and update it accordingly. This helped her stay on track, make necessary adjustments, and identify any patterns in her productivity. 4. Limit daily tasks: Setting a maximum number of tasks to focus on each day prevented her from feeling overwhelmed. This forced her to be more selective in her priorities and fully commit to what was most important. 5. Find a preferred method of organization: Experimenting with different ways of organizing her notebook, such as bullet journaling or color-coding, allowed her to find the method that best suited her preferences and work style. By making these changes and adopting the daily notebook as her primary organizational tool, she noticed significant improvements in both her productivity and overall outlook on her workload. She was able to reduce stress, more efficiently complete tasks, and ultimately achieve a better work-life balance.

Long ago, a young Plains warrior is tested by being the target of three different weapons. Centuries later, Ernest P. Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud. A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. After he goes too far by intentionally causing Moustafa Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake during swimming, only for Moustafa to be rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, badly injuring Stennis's leg in the process. Since Stennis is no longer able to perform his duties as a counselor and Kikakee is already shorthanded, Tipton offers Stennis's position to Ernest. The Second Chancers initially give Ernest trouble, but they start to show respect during a campfire session when Nurse St. Cloud translates her grandfather's description of the warrior initiation ritual for his tribe. The initiate must hold still while a knife, a stone hatchet, and an arrow are thrown or shot at him. The courage of the young warrior apparently alters the course of each weapon to prevent it from striking him. The Second Chancers build a tepee only to find it burned. They fight Pennington, one of the regular campers, because he was responsible. Tipton is poised to expel them, but Ernest convinces him otherwise.

A:","response":"First, let's analyze the title \\"Back to the Grotto\\" to understand its meaning and context. Step 1: Break down the title into its components. - \\"Back\\" implies a return or revisiting of something. - \\"to the\\" is a preposition leading to the main subject of the title. - \\"Grotto\\" is a natural or artificial cave used by humans, often found near water and typically associated with seclusion or religious practices. Step 2: Compare the title's components with the given categories. - Company: It doesn't seem to fit as a company name, as \\"Back to the Grotto\\" doesn't imply any business or industry. - Educational institution: It's not likely to be related to an educational institution, as the title doesn't evoke any educational themes or concepts. - Artist, Athlete, Office holder: The title does not contain any personal name, which can hint at human beings. - Mean of transportation: \\"Grotto\\" does not represent any mode of transportation. - Building: A grotto is a natural or artificial cave, not a man-made building. - Natural place: This category appears to be the most fitting one, as a grotto is a type of natural place. - Village, Animal, Plant: These categories are not compatible with the term \\"grotto.\\" - Album, Film, or Written work: While \\"Back to the Grotto\\" could potentially be the title of an artistic or written work, we don't have enough context to make this determination directly. Based on the provided information and categories, \\"natural place\\" is the most likely option. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the title, \\"Back to the Grotto\\" most likely belongs to the category of \\"natural place.\\""},{"question":"Do these questions have the same meaning? What is the difference between love and friendship? What is the difference between the feelings of affection, attraction, trust, intimacy, love, true love, lust, crush, infatuation, obsession, passion and compassion? Select from the following. (i) no. (ii) yes.","response":"(i) no While both questions aim to understand the distinctions between various types of interpersonal relationships and emotions, they are not identical in their scope or meaning. The first question, \\"What is the difference between love and friendship?\\" specifically focuses on the distinction between these two types of connection. Love can refer to romantic love, which often involves deeper emotional connections, physical attraction, and a sense of commitment. Friendship, on the other hand, is a bond between two people based on mutual affection, trust, and support, without necessarily involving romantic feelings or a physical aspect. The second question, \\"What is the difference between the feelings of affection, attraction, trust, intimacy, love, true love, lust, crush, infatuation, obsession, passion, and compassion?\\", is more comprehensive, asking for clarification on a broader range of emotions and connections that people might experience in their relationships. Let's delve into each of these emotions and explore their differences: 1. Affection: This is a gentle feeling of fondness and liking towards someone. It is a foundational emotion for building connection and can be present in various types of relationships, including familial and platonic ones. 2. Attraction: This refers to the magnetic pull you feel towards someone, usually because of their appearance or personality. Attraction is common in romantic relationships but can also exist in friendships. 3. Trust: Trust is a confidence in someone's honesty, reliability, and loyalty. It is an essential component of healthy relationships, including friendships, romantic partnerships, and family bonds. 4. Intimacy: Intimacy is a close, personal connection shared between two individuals, which can be emotional, intellectual, or physical. It can exist within friendships but is often more profound and complex in romantic relationships. 5. Love: Love is a deep emotional attachment that goes beyond mere affection and attraction. It usually encompasses feelings of care, dedication, and a sense of belonging to one another. Love can be experienced with friends, family members, and romantic partners. 6. True love: This term usually refers to a pure, selfless, and unwavering love that transcends emotional fluctuations or external factors. Some people argue that it represents the ultimate form of love, but the concept varies across different cultures and belief systems. 7. Lust: Lust is a strong physical desire for someone, often driven by sexual attraction. While it can be present in romantic relationships, it is generally considered distinct from love because it doesn't necessarily involve an emotional bond. 8. Crush: A crush is a temporary, often light-hearted infatuation with someone. It is characterized by having romantic feelings and fantasies about the person, without the depth and commitment of stronger emotions like love. 9. Infatuation: Infatuation is an intense, short-lived passion for someone. It is often fueled by idealization and projection, without a deep understanding of the other person. Infatuation differs from love, which is typically more enduring and grounded in reality. 10. Obsession: An obsession is an unhealthy fixation on someone that can be all-consuming and interfere with your ability to think rationally. It is an extreme form of attraction that can have detrimental effects on both parties involved. 11. Passion: Passion is a powerful and often overwhelming feeling of enthusiasm, excitement, or energy directed towards someone or something. It can be present in both romantic and non-romantic contexts. 12. Compassion: Compassion is a sympathetic concern for the suffering or well-being of others. It is driven by empathy and a desire to care for or help alleviate their pain, and it generally extends beyond the boundaries of close relationships. In summary, these two questions are related but not identical, as the second query provides a wider exploration of emotions and connections compared to the first, which specifically focuses on love and friendship."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Jin-tae Lee owns a shoeshine stand to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok's education. Jin-tae also bought a silver pen for Jin-seok. Jin-tae's fiancÃ©e Young-shin works with the Lee's noodle shop. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invades South Korea. Both brothers are forcibly conscripted. They then become a part of the 1st Infantry Division, fighting at the Pusan Perimeter and then advancing north. Jin-tae is told by his commanding officer that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit, his brother can be sent home. Jin-tae willingly volunteers for many dangerous missions and is quickly promoted to the rank of Chungsa (Sergeant). His heroic feats during the urban battle of Pyongyang finally result in Jin-tae being nominated for the medal.

These include impressionism and the modernist styles of expressionism, abstract painting and surrealism. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten (1909–1912), Linien (1930s and 1940s), COBRA (avant-garde movement) (1948–51), Fluxus (1960s and 1970s), Junge Wilde (1980s) and more recently Superflex (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various art movements include Theodor Philipsen (1840–1920, impressionism and naturalism), Anna Klindt Sørensen (1899–1985, expressionism), Franciska Clausen (1899–1986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), Henry Heerup (1907–1993, naivism), Robert Jacobsen (1912–1993, abstract painting), Carl Henning Pedersen (1913–2007, abstract painting), Asger Jorn (1914–1973, Situationist, abstract painting), Bjørn Wiinblad (1918–2006, art deco, orientalism), Per Kirkeby (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), Per Arnoldi (b. 1941, pop art), Michael Kvium (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg Kærn (b. 1969, superrealism).

Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that...

Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Greg is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A maintains a high-fat diet, but patient B does not maintain a high fat diet. Greg is advising the patients how lifestyle change can improve their health. Which patient would more likely risk cardiovascular disease, patient A or patient B?

Choices: - happiness for - new laws - protest - change in leadership - cultural revolution The rationale to choose \\"cultural revolution\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"A coup-de-etat refers to the sudden, often violent overthrow of an existing government by a small group, with the aim of either installing themselves as the new ruling power or installing a new political group that aligns with their ideologies. The primary goal of those instigating a coup-de-etat is often to replace the existing regime with one that will establish different political, economic, or social policies. Within the context of the given choices: 1. Happiness for all: While a coup-de-etat might bring some level of happiness or satisfaction to certain groups of people, happiness alone isn't the sole purpose of undertaking such a drastic action. Happiness is too vague and subjective a term to clarify the specific objectives of the group orchestrating the coup. 2. New laws: While a coup-de-etat often leads to the establishment of new laws, these changes are usually the result of the broader societal shifts that occur after the regime change. It is important to note that merely changing laws without addressing the deeper issues within society does not guarantee meaningful or enduring transformation. 3. Protest: Protests are generally non-violent means of expressing dissent against existing policies or government actions. They differ fundamentally from a coup-de-etat, which is a more forceful and usually violent attempt to overthrow a government entirely. 4. Change in leadership: A coup-de-etat obviously involves a change in leadership. However, this choice falls short of fully capturing the extensive depth and breadth of changes that accompany most successful coups. 5. Cultural revolution: This choice best describes the ultimate goal of a coup-de-etat that is intended to change society. A cultural revolution indicates a series of profound and far-reaching changes in a society's political, economic, and social structures, as well as its norms, values, and belief systems. It signifies a period of transformation in which every aspect of life is expected to shift, leading to the establishment of new values, institutions, and modes of behavior. It is a comprehensive and radical process that goes beyond superficial changes in leadership and lawmaking and targets the fundamental fabric of society. Given the explanation provided above, \\"cultural revolution\\" is the most appropriate choice to describe what is called for when a coup-de-etat happens with hopes of changing society. It encapsulates the broader implications and the transformative nature of the event that goes beyond simply altering specific policies and leaders, and encompasses a complete overhaul of societal paradigms and structures."},{"question":"Goal: blade Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","response":"To provide a detailed response to your query, it's important for us to understand the context in which the term \\"blade\\" is being used.

This can be achieved using various techniques from hand tools (such as files and abrasives) to modern machine tools (such as milling machines and CNC machines). This method is more reasonable if you are looking for precision, control over the design, and versatility in using different materials. Forging Method: This involves heating the metal to a malleable state and shaping the blade by hammering, bending, and pressing. Blacksmiths often use this method, but it requires a high skill set, specialized tools, and safety precautions. Forging is ideal for achieving unique designs and shapes, as well as enhanced durability in specific scenarios where the forging technique aligns the metal's grain structure. 2. Propeller Blade: Should you intend to design a propeller blade, the focus will be on generating lift and thrust based on the blade's shape, profile, and materials. The methods used to create propeller blades are: A. Casting Method: In this method, the blade is produced by pouring molten metal into a mold replicating the desired shape. This method is commonly used for smaller and less complex blades made from brass, aluminum, or bronze. B. Milling and Machining Method: In this approach, the blade is shaped using various machine tools, such as milling machines or CNC machines, to remove material and achieve the desired profile. This method provides precise control over the blade's profile and allows the use of a greater range of materials, including stainless steel, aluminum, and composite materials. 3. Blade Server: The goal related to this term revolves around installing, configuring, or maintaining blade servers. In this situation, two common methods help achieve the goal. A. Manual Installation and Configuration: A system administrator would physically install the blade server hardware (the blade server chassis and individual blade components) and configure it by following the manufacturer's guidelines. This will involve integrating the new blade server into the existing network infrastructure and installing the desired software and operating systems. This method is adequate for small- to medium-sized installations or when specific customizations are needed. B. Automated Deployment and Configuration: In the case of larger installations or a need for standardized configurations, tools such as PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment) or configuration management systems like Puppet, Chef, or Ansible are used. These tools help automate the process of installing and configuring blade servers, which can reduce human error and significantly improve and streamline data center management. To summarize, the method that's most reasonable for accomplishing the goal depends on the context in which the term \\"blade\\" is being used and the specific manufacturing methods mentioned. In terms of knife blades, the stock removal method offers more precision and versatility. When designing a propeller blade, a balanced approach using casting or machining (depending on blade complexity and material) is reasonable. Finally, when installing a blade server, automating the deployment and configuration process is beneficial for larger data centers or when standardization is desired."},{"question":"Закон Видемана — Франца Translate this to English?","response":"The Widemann-Franz Law The Widemann-Franz Law, also known as the Lorentz Law or the Drude-Lorentz-Wiedemann-Franz law, is a fundamental principle in the physics of solid materials, specifically regarding the electrical and thermal conductivities of metals. The law establishes a relationship between the thermal conductivity (k), the electrical conductivity (σ), and the temperature (T) of a metal. The law was initially derived independently by Gustav Wiedemann and Rudolph Franz in 1853. In mathematical terms, the Widemann-Franz Law can be represented as: k/σ = L * T In this formula, L is a constant called the Lorenz number or the Wiedemann-Franz-Lorenz constant, which has a value of approximately 2.44 x 10⁻⁸ W * Ω * K⁻². It should be noted that this constant is only applicable to metals that follow the classical model of electronic conduction, meaning that its accuracy may be diminished when applied to nonmetallic materials or metals with strong electron-electron or electron-phonon interactions. The significance of the Widemann-Franz Law lies in its ability to provide insights into the nature of electrons in metal conductors. The law suggests that the same electrons responsible for conducting electricity within a metal also play a role in the metal's thermal conductivity. This connection between thermal and electrical conductivities is evidenced by the linear relationship between the two properties established by the law. In addition, the Widemann-Franz Law serves as a powerful tool for characterizing and predicting the behavior of electronic materials. This can be particularly valuable in the development of new technologies, such as the design of electronic devices and the optimization of energy-efficient materials for various applications. In summary, the Widemann-Franz Law is an essential principle in the field of solid-state physics, establishing a connection between the electrical and thermal conductivities of metals and providing valuable insights into the behavior of electrons within conductive materials. This law has broad applications in both fundamental research and the advancement of technology."},{"question":"Q:Question: Who was moses learning from? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Ten Commandments Context: Despite its epic scale, the Moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the Ten Commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus's healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love. This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed. Throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story.

In the scenario, Sean has returned home from grocery shopping and is putting his groceries away before using his computer. Let's go through the options one by one: - Mug: While it is possible to put a teabag in a mug if Sean were about to make tea, the context provided is about storing groceries away, not immediate use. Therefore, it is unlikely that Sean would have put the teabags in a mug. - Refrigerator: Generally, teabags do not require refrigeration. They are best stored in a cool, dry place. Therefore, it is unlikely that Sean would store his teabags in the refrigerator. - Teapot: A teapot is used for brewing tea, not for storing teabags. It is where you put the teabags when you are preparing the tea, along with hot water. So, it does not seem like a suitable place for Sean to store his teabags after grocery shopping. - Internet cafe: This option is not relevant to the question, as an internet cafe is a public place where individuals go to access computers and the internet, and it is not a place to store groceries. - Cupboard: Out of the given options, this is the most suitable and logical place for Sean to store his teabags. Cupboards are used for storing groceries, and it is common to store non-perishable items such as teabags in cupboards. The cool, dry environment of a cupboard is ideal for maintaining the freshness and flavor of teabags.

Kieran Corcoran. PUBLISHED:. 07:28 EST, 16 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:44 EST, 16 December 2013. A sunny day usually brings crowds to the beach – unless it’s your own private sandy spot on the coast. Now there is a rare chance to snap up a Georgian manor house with its own secluded cove as well as stunning views, links with royalty and 30 acres. The benefits will cost a pretty penny, however, as Redlap House in Devon is on the market for £7.5 million. Picturesque: Redlap House boasts seven bedrooms and a history bound up in illegal shipping activity. Private: The house's beach is only accessible from the property itself or the sea. Set away: The countryside residence (circled) is said to be the most expensive in the West County. For that, the new owner will enjoy. seven bedrooms, four reception rooms, a 60ft indoor infinity pool and. cliff-top garden with hot tub. There. is also a guest house with a cinema, barbecue room and art studio. Parking is unlikely to be a problem with six garages and the garden. rarely suffers frost, allowing tropical plants to flourish. Yesterday,. Martin Lamb, director of the Exeter office of estate agents Savills,. said: ‘In 30 years, this is the only house I have sold with its own. private beach. This is the best house I have sold. It is like the South. of France but in Devon.” In the last century, the estate played host to various royals on visits to Dartmouth to see the Fleet or Royal Naval College. Its. location, with access to the cove only via the house or sea, made it. perfect for ships to drop off contraband. The Governor of Dartmouth, who. owned the estate in the 18th century, was an active smuggler. During his ownership the property was fitted with false walls to conceal contraband, and there are longstanding rumours of a secret tunnel linking the property to nearby Redlap Cove. However a tunnel has never been found, and the beach is accessed by steps leading down from the garden. There are also rumours that George V visited the house, as he was frequently seen in the area while he was Prince of Wales in the earlier 20th Century. Fancy a dip? The house has its own indoor pool which looks out over the sea. Secret access: The governer of Dartmouth used the links between the house (left) and beach (centre) for smuggling in the 18th Century. It has now been put on the market for. 'offers in excess of £7.5 million', making it one of the West Country's. most expensive homes - though it is still a third of the price of a. five-bedroom flat in One Hyde Park, London. Savills, the agents marketing the Redlap House, today described the home as 'the finest coastal property in south Devon'. Martin Lamb, director of the Exeter office, said: 'In 30 years this is the only house I have ever sold with its own private beach. 'It is in a cove on a very rugged coastline and it was perfect for ships to drop off contraband before arriving in Dartmouth. It is a wonderful family home set back from the cliff in tropical gardens. There is very rarely any frost and in the garden you can actually grow bananas. Spacious: The 8,400sq/ft home also has a guesthouse which is almost as large again. Lavish: Redlap house's guest house is almost as large as the main building, and features its own cinema. Roomy: The property boasts a total of four reception areas. 'It has always been the most expensive coastal home in Devon and is the best house I have sold. The holiday cottage, which is made from oak, has a stunning pool and overlooks the sea. It is like the south of France but in Devon.' On top of the principal house, which measures 8,400sq/ft, there is also an additional guest house and pool complex which adds a further 7,000sq/ft. The guest house boasts the 60-foot pool along with a 22-foot cinema, two bedrooms and a fully equipped barbecue room and art studio.

These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around 80 to 300 miles (130 to 480 km), travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970 km/hr) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) and are up to 45 feet (14 metres) high.A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as refraction - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography. As a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale. Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first.... answer the following question: What is the name when a tsunami does not usually break but rushes inland, flooding all in its path?

The energy emitted by microwaves is powerful enough to cause rapid heating in foods, which may not be the best environment for delicate electronics. Also, smartphones and their charging cables are not designed to withstand the intense energy produced by a microwave. If I placed my phone inside a microwave to charge it, there's a high probability that the components would be damaged permanently or even cause a fire hazard.

They had to prepare for a school project so they decided to learn about animals. Manny studied animal communication, while Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition. Which student learned more about animals working together to find food? Hint: Communication is any way that animals share information. Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing. A:","response":"Based on the provided information, it is likely that Manny, who studied animal communication, learned more about animals working together to find food. The hint emphasizes the importance of communication as a way for animals to share information, specifically among animals that live in social groups. Effective communication enables these animals to cooperate and avoid conflict with one another, which in turn enhances their overall chances for survival and reproduction. Studying animal communication would give Manny insight into various ways animals work together to find food, as many animals use different forms of communication such as vocalizations, body language, and chemical signals to achieve this goal. These communications can help them coordinate their efforts when locating food sources, share knowledge about the location of new food sources, and alert each other to potential dangers. On the other hand, Dean's study of animal feeding patterns and nutrition focuses more on the actual process of consuming food, the nutritional value of their diet, and the specific dietary requirements of various animal species. While this study is important in understanding how animals meet their nutritional needs and how it affects their growth, development, and overall health, it does not concentrate on the aspect of animals working together in their quest for food. In summary, although both Manny and Dean acquired valuable knowledge about animals in their respective areas of study, it can be concluded that Manny, who studied animal communication, learned more about animals working together to find food. This is due to the fact that communication plays a critical role in the cooperation and coordination among animals that live in social groups, facilitating efficient ways of searching for, sharing, and consuming food resources."},{"question":"What is a question about this article?

They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

However, they each have been involved in producing written works. Tina Turner, born Anna Mae Bullock, is an American-born Swiss singer, songwriter, and actress. She rose to fame in the 1960s as a part of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue and has had a long solo career since the late 1970s. Turner has released two autobiographies that detail her life story and experiences: “I, Tina” (1986), which she co-wrote with Kurt Loder, and “My Love Story” (2018), which she co-wrote with Dominik Wichmann and Deborah Davis. Shirley Manson, on the other hand, is a Scottish musician and actress best known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band Garbage. While Manson is an accomplished songwriter and has written numerous essays and articles for various publications, she has not published any books as an author as of my last update.

Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams, Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), as the titular hero's archenemy, and subsequently a villain to the X-Men and their various sub-groups as well. Mojo is one of the \\"Spineless Ones,\\" an alien race that is immobile without advanced technology. At the time she wrote the Longshot miniseries, writer Ann Nocenti was pursuing her Master's degree at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, working at the magazine Lies of Our Times, and reading the work of writers like Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman and Walter Lippmann. Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences. (A character named Manufactured Consent after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in Nocenti's 1990 book The New Mutants Summer Special, was also born of these works.) Artist Art Adams designed the character per Nocenti's instructions that he be disgusting and unpleasant, and also tried to make him look frightening. The wires that hold Mojo's eyelids open, thus preventing him from blinking, were inspired by an interview with actor Malcolm McDowell on Late Night with David Letterman, in which McDowell revealed that the similar apparatus he had to wear for the Ludovico technique scene in A Clockwork Orange had scarred his corneas. The rest of the equipment attached to Mojo's head controls his mechanized chair. Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), and was the main villain of the miniseries, appearing in the subsequent three issues. The character subsequently appeared in The New Mutants Annual #2 (1986). That same year, in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #10, Mojo appeared as the villain in the story, which saw Longshot join the X-Men. In 1988, Mojo appeared in a backup story in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #12. He was the main villain of the one-shot special Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem (December 1989). Subsequent appearances include Marvel Comics Presents #89 (1991), The Uncanny X-Men Annual #15 (1991), Wolverine #52 (March 1992), X-Men #6 (March 1992), Wolverine #53 (April 1992), X-Men #7 (April 1992), #10-11 (July-August 1992), The Uncanny X-Men Annual 16 (Annual 1992), Marvel Comics Presents #119 (1993), What If? #59 (March 1994), X-Men Adventures: Season Two #11 (December 1994), Marvel: Portraits of the Universe #1 (March 1995), X-Men: Mutations #1 (1996), Youngblood/X-Force #1 (July 1996), X-Force/Youngblood #1 (August 1996), X-Force #60-61 (November-December 1996), The Adventures of the X-Men #9-10 (1996-January 1997), X-Babies: Murderama #1 (January 1998), X-Force #76 (April 1998), X-Babies Reborn #1 (January 2000), X-Men Unlimited #32 (September 2001), Exiles #18-19 (December 2002-January 2003), The Uncanny X-Men #460-461 (August 2005), and Exiles #73-74 (February 2006).

The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land. - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man.

The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses .

Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back .

It consists of the plays Wallenstein's Camp , a lengthy prologue, The Piccolomini , and Wallenstein's Death . Schiller himself also structured the trilogy into two parts, with Wallenstein I including Wallenstein's Camp and The Piccolomini, and Wallenstein II consisting of Wallenstein's Death. He completed the trilogy in 1799. In this drama Schiller addresses the decline of the famous general Albrecht von Wallenstein, basing it loosely on actual historical events during the Thirty Years' War. Wallenstein fails at the height of his power as successful commander-in-chief of the imperial army when he begins to rebel against his emperor, Ferdinand II. The action is set some 16 years after the start of the war, in the winter of 1633/1634 and begins in the Bohemian city of Pilsen, where Wallenstein is based with his troops. For the second and third acts of the third play the action moves to Eger, where Wallenstein has fled and where he was assassinated on 26 February 1634. How many years after Wallenstein was assassinated was the trilogy completed?","response":"To determine how many years after Wallenstein was assassinated the trilogy was completed, we need to find the difference between the year of completion of the trilogy and the year of Wallenstein's assassination. 1.

Each time I went the food was actually really good, so I decided to order catering, being that the food was really good and the service was good the last few times I went. Apparently the service changed, and this is where they lose me as a customer. A few days ago I tried to order catering from this company for a small party. My husband had gone into the restaurant 2 days prior to me ordering, just to check out the catering prices. They had a new menu posted on their wall inside the restaurant, the man at the counter even pointed it out to my husband and said \\"these are our new catering prices\\". The prices on the menu had the tax included on them, so we knew exactly what to expect for our budget. My husband even took a picture on his phone, and showed it to me when he got home. So a few days later, I called them and kept the order simple, ordered five trays: two types of rice, two types of meat and noodles. When the lady on the phone told me the total, I was in awe! I did the math by the prices on their new menu, added the delivery charge, and tax, and the order was way off....by almost 70!! When I requested that she repeat everything back to me, she broke the charges down by what I ordered and the prices were NOT what they had posted on their menu, they were higher. I confronted her and told her that the charges she quoted me were not the prices that they had on their menu and that my husband was in there a few days ago. She laughed and said that is not what they have on their wall. When I told my husband the total he was enraged. My husband got on the phone and asked to speak to a manager. A guy came on the phone, let my husband tell him the problem, and then said \\"We give you special price\\" and quoted him a different price, that was still higher than what they had posted on their wall. My husband said \\"That is not what you have posted on your wall in your restaurant, I was over there 2 days ago, all we want is the price you have advertised\\". The man said that they cannot give us that price, he didn't even explain why. The man on the phone sounded like he didn't even care, he didn't even try to help us. So we told them no way, and cancelled the order. They have lost me as a customer. I am not going back there. If they screw up like that, it makes me wonder how future orders would have been for me.

Wykham Delandre had quarrelled with his sister--or perhaps it was that she had quarrelled with him--and they were on terms not merely of armed neutrality but of bitter hatred. The quarrel had been antecedent to Margaret going to Brent's Rock. She and Wykham had almost come to blows. There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other; and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house. She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house. On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day. Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock. It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Even his own servants never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in the house being aware of his coming.

However, many of us feel awkward when meeting people for the first time, especially when we aren't quite sure what to say. The situation feels cold, even icy. \\"Breaking the ice\\" is a term widely used in the English-speaking countries to describe a small talk technique that can help rescue a conversation from certain failure. So where do you even begin? Well, a good start is to accept that it is perfectly normal to feel a little nervous when talking to someone for the first time. They might look _ or scary, but they could turn out to be the nicest person you've ever met. You might think that breaking the ice is difficult. But sometimes just a simple \\"hello\\", followed by a three-second smile, can make all the difference. Complimenting someone on their garment or accessories is also a great, easy way to break the ice. You might say: \\"I love your jacket. Where did you buy it from?\\" Being in an uncomfortable or unpleasant situation with someone new might feel terrible, but it can actually be one of the best icebreakers. By focusing on the situation, you come together to fight the common enemy: the long bathroom queue, for example, or the overcrowded bus.

But he has denied any wrongdoing and it is not yet clear why he left. The team was overhauled earlier this week with the addition of a new campaign chief executive and a new campaign manager. Mr Trump, who arrived in Louisiana on Friday to meet flood victims, has come under pressure in recent weeks after a series of controversial remarks and falling poll numbers. Mr Manafort's lobbying connections to pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine are certainly a distraction for Mr Trump's presidential campaign - but unlikely to be the main reason for his departure. In spite of Mr Manafort's efforts to impose discipline on the Republican nominee, Mr Trump continues to do badly in the polls and has reportedly bristled at efforts to bring him under control. After all, \\"being Trump\\" is how he won the nomination in the first place. His new team now faces the task of allowing him to be himself while making sure he stays on message - attacking his Democratic rival Hilary Clinton instead of sparking controversy with his own verbal missteps. \\"This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,\\" Mr Trump said in a statement. \\"I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process.\\" Mr Manafort has faced public scrutiny in recent weeks after the New York Times reported that the Ukrainian government had uncovered ledgers pledging more than 12m (Â£9.2m) in undisclosed cash payments for his work with Mr Yanukovych, who fled after an uprising in November 2013. Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Bureau is also investigating business deals worth millions of dollar that are linked to Mr Manafort. He has vehemently dismissed the claims and denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton said Mr Manafort was another example of Mr Trump's ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \\"You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn't end the odd bromance Trump has with Putin,\\" Robbie Mook said. \\"Trump still has to answer serious questions hovering over his campaign given his propensity to parrot Putin's talking points.\\" Mr Manafort, a former adviser to George HW Bush and Bob Dole, only joined the Trump campaign in March, to help the New Yorker secure the party's nomination. He was promoted to campaign manager in June. The announcement of new campaign chief, Kellyanne Conway, and campaign CEO, Stephen Bannon, earlier this week raised questions about whether it would diminish Mr Manafort's role. The longtime Republican operative was considered a guiding hand in steering Mr Trump toward a more conventional campaign as opposed to the anti-establishment brand of politics that made his primary campaign successful. A hotel developer with no previous experience of politics, Mr Trump stunned the political world by beating far more experienced figures in the Republican Party. He faces Mrs Clinton, who has come under intense criticism over her email arrangements while secretary of state, in November's election.

We have lived in a state prone to hurricanes for eight years and didn’t really have anything ready in case of a natural disaster.

Here’s an affiliate link to one that’s for four people. (Four Person Perfect Survival Kit Deluxe) They have several variations to choose from. Preparing a Hurricane Emergency Kit I will walk you through a few things to consider when preparing an emergency kit. Saving Money I would be lying if I didn’t say that I was financially driven to prepare a kit. The state of Virginia has one three-day sales tax holiday weekend beginning the first Friday in August. Yes, saving on tax pushed me to buy a bunch of stuff that I just may need one day. In addition to saving taxes on emergency preparedness items, customers can save tax on clothing, footwear, school supplies, and Energy Star and WaterSense products. For complete details on qualifying items and more, please go to Virginia’s Government Tax Page. Not in Virginia? Search “your state” + “emergency preparedness” or “emergency kit.” You can replace “hurricane” with “earthquake” or “tornado” or any other applicable term for your area. Depending on how much you purchase, the saving on taxes can add up pretty quickly.

Their primary goal is to ensure that people have the necessary items and information to stay safe and prepared during a hurricane. Therefore, the NHC might not have a specific opinion on Amazon emergency kits. Those kits could work as long as they contain all the required items and are of good quality, but it is always a good idea to cross-reference the kit contents with the NHC's recommendations and make sure you have everything you need to be prepared. When creating or purchasing a hurricane emergency kit, ensure it covers essential items like non-perishable food, water, medication, first-aid supplies, flashlights, batteries, and other necessary items specified by NHC's supply list. It's crucial to consider your family's specific needs, such as including items for pets, infants, elderly, and any family members with special medical needs. In conclusion, the National Hurricane Center's main priority is to ensure people are well-equipped and informed to face hurricane situations. While they do not explicitly comment on the effectiveness of specific kits from Amazon or other manufacturers, it is essential to ensure that the emergency kit meets NHC's recommended guidelines and covers your family's specific needs to be considered effective."},{"question":"Rani Mukerji (born 21 March 1978) is an Indian actress. She has won several awards, including seven Filmfare Awards. Her film roles have been cited as a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in Hindi cinema. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. Rani Mukerji was born in Mumbai on 21 March 1978. Her father, Ram Mukherjee (born to the Mukherjee-Samarth family), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios. Her mother, Krishna Mukherjee, is a former playback singer. Her elder brother, Raja Mukherjee, is a film producer and director. Her maternal aunt, Debashree Roy, is a Bengali film actress and her paternal cousin, Kajol, is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary. Another paternal cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and film director. Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film. She said, \\"There were already too many actresses at home and I wanted to be someone different\\". Mukerji received her education at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu and graduated with a degree in Home Science from SNDT Women's University. She is a trained Odissi dancer and began learning the dance form while in the tenth grade. As part of an annual tradition, the Mukherjee family celebrates the festival of Durga Puja in the suburban neighbourhood of Santacruz every year. Mukerji, a practising Hindu, takes part in the festivities with her entire family. In 1994, director Salim Khan approached her to play the lead female role in his directorial, Aa Gale Lag Jaa. Her father disapproved of a full-time career in film at such a young age, so she rejected the offer. At the age of eighteen, Mukerji experimented with acting by portraying a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film Biyer Phool (1996). The film starred Prosenjit and Indrani Haldar in lead roles and narrates the story of two sisters; Mukerji played the younger sibling of Haldar's character. Soon after, Khan approached her with another film offer to play the protagonist of the social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, Mukerji accepted the role due to her mother's insistence that she continue to pursue acting on an experimental basis. Before she began work on the film, Mukerji trained at Roshan Taneja's acting institute.

While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\".

To avoid hurting your hands, and to give yourself a stable grip on the weeds, use cotton gardening gloves. You can purchase cotton gardening gloves at any nursery or gardening center. Hand weeding is an effective, though time-consuming and tedious, method of controlling weeds. This method is preferable in small lawns, or in lawns not completely overrun with weeds. If weeds in your lawn are widespread, another removal method will be more practical. The blade of the trowel or digger should be at about a 65° angle—not quite vertical, but largely upright. Drive the tool into the soil about 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) to loosen the soil surrounding the weed’s roots. Repeat this 3 or 4 times, loosening the soil on all sides of the root. Trowels and dandelion diggers can both be purchased at a local plant nursery or gardening center. Both should cost less than 5 USD. To properly remove a weed, you need to pull it out by the root. Hold the base of the weed firmly, using your full hand—don’t just pinch the stalk of a weed using 2 fingers. If you’re pulling up a clump of weeds, grasp the entire clump at its base. Perennial weeds like dandelions can be plucked most effectively in early spring. If left to grow until summer, the dandelions will have put down thick taproots. Loosen the root in the soil if you feel resistance when you attempt to uproot it. Twist the base of the root back and forth 5 or 6 times. This will loosen the weed’s roots in the soil and make it easier to pull. If you pull too hard without rotating the weed, its stem will snap off but the root will remain in the ground. The weeds can quickly regrow from a root still in the ground. If there is a small hole left behind after you’ve pulled the weed, fill it with some loose soil. Carry a small trash bag around with you as you move across your lawn pulling weeds. As soon as you’ve plucked weeds—whether individual or in large clumps—from the ground, toss them into the bag. This will prevent the weeds’ seeds from scattering over your lawn.

So, the equation can be rewritten as: 6*y = 12 Step 2: Solve for y by isolating the variable (y) on one side of the equation. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 6.

Nolan once again proves himself to be a formidable storyteller with an unrivaled passion and understanding of the cinematic medium. Interstellar is nothing less than a love letter to cosmic sci-fi and metaphysical philosophy. Set in the near but unspecified future, the movie introduces us to an Earth ravaged by famine and dust storms. Matthew McConaughey delivers an unforgettable performance as Joseph Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer, battling the harsh realities while nurturing his young family. The plot dramatically unfolds as Cooper stumbles upon the last remnants of NASA, now an underground organization planning to save humanity by exploring habitable planets in other galaxies. The film's visual spectacle is awe-inspiring. Teaming once again with Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan presents outer space with majestic grandeur and scientific authenticity. The sequences exploring the cosmic realms are the visual and emotional heart of \\"Interstellar,\\" transcending simple narrative storytelling and venturing into the realm of pure, experiential cinema. In terms of performance, Matthew McConaughey is at his best in \\"Interstellar.\\" His portrayal of Cooper, a man torn between love for his family and duty towards humanity, is emotionally touching. Anne Hathaway matches him step for step, providing a subtle but powerful performance as the scientist Amelia Brand. The chemistry between the principal actors is a sublime blend of professional competence and emotional connection that greatly services the depth of the narrative. However, the movie’s major strength—its awe-inspiring scale and philosophical ambition—also proves to be its slight weakness. At times, the grand concepts and scientific theories warp into each other, leaving room for potential confusion. Yet, even in these moments, the film remains a breathtaking spectacle that demands to be seen on the largest screen possible. Enriched by Hans Zimmer's extraordinarily emotive score, which adds a thrilling framework to the visual spectacle, \\"Interstellar\\" is a rare cinematic feat. Captivating, existential, and deeply human, the film is a cerebral meditation on love, loss, and survival. It is an emotionally charged, philosophically challenging, and visually stunning odyssey that demands the audience’s utmost attention and rewards them generously for it. Viewers need to be aware that \\"Interstellar\\" is heavy fare; it's not your typical popcorn thriller. It requires patience to fully grasp the narrative's nuances and engagement with the themes of existentialism, love, and sacrifice. While the plot might seem convoluted initially, the threads come together beautifully by the end, leaving the viewer with much to contemplate. In conclusion, \\"Interstellar\\" is an audacious and striking work of art from a filmmaker who seems incapable of thinking small. Its few narrative missteps are overshadowed by the sheer cinematic splendor on display. For those who relish intellectual and visually dense cinema, \\"Interstellar\\" is a journey worth taking.

She is a mom of two girls. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN) -- Seven years ago, Barbara Theodosiou, then a successful entrepreneur building a women's business mentoring group, stopped going to meetings, leaving the house and taking care of herself. She grew increasingly distraught. \\"You almost wake up and get this haunting feeling, this horrible feeling that my God, I just wish I wasn't going to live today,\\" said Theodosiou, a mother of four from Davie, Florida. \\"Not that you would take your life but you're so scared.\\" Petrified, really, but not for herself. For her children. Theodosiou learned two of her four kids were addicted to drugs. \\"I found out within six months that both my sons were addicts and like every other mother, I just wanted to go into bed and never get out.\\" Her older son, Peter, now 25, took prescription drugs and then escalated to heroin. Her younger son, Daniel, now 22, started what's called robotripping, where he would take large quantities of cough medicine to get high. Barbara Theodosiou first noticed her son Daniel might have a problem with drugs when he was 16. She says she first noticed signs of problems when her younger son was 16. \\"I was taking Daniel to school one day and he was just like almost choking. I thought he was having a panic attack,\\" she said. A short time later, the school called and said staff members thought Daniel was on drugs. \\"I was like, 'There's no way.' ... I have talked to my children my whole life about drugs.\\" Within just months, after a call from her son Peter's roommate, her husband went to his house and found needles all over the place. \\"If you know about addiction then when you find this out, you realize not only are you in for the fight of your life, but this is not something that gets fixed in six months. This could go on,\\" she said. Barbara Theodosiou's son Peter was addicted to heroin. He has been in recovery for 3½ years. \\"It's like having someone punch you in the stomach. ... You're never the same from the second you find out.\\" How does the mother of an addict cope? How does she juggle the incomprehensible challenge between supporting a loved one and not enabling their habit? And how does she deal with the stigma of having a child who is an addict? In my in-depth interviews with Theodosiou and other mothers of addicts across the country, they made it very clear that being the mother of an addict is an incredibly lonely and isolating place, and that often the only people who understand what they're going through are other mothers who are going through it themselves. The fear of getting the call Theodosiou's son Daniel overdosed three times that first year she realized he was using and nearly died each time. One day, she returned to her house and saw police officers out front. \\"I remember pulling up and my heart was beating ... I was just going to faint right there.\\" The police officer asked if she was Daniel's mother. \\"For sure, I thought he was going to tell me Daniel was dead, and it ended up Daniel overdosed again, and again he was in the hospital.\\" Melva Sherwood's son Andrew died from a heroin overdose in October 2012. He was 27. Melva Sherwood of Vermilion, Ohio, got that unimaginable call on October 3, 2012. Her son Andrew, 27 at the time, died of an overdose of heroin. It was his son's fifth birthday. \\"It was 11:30 at night. I was sound asleep and it was October. All the windows were open, and the entire neighborhood knew what had happened,\\" said Sherwood, who says she screamed \\"at the reality of it, that it was over, that it was done.\\" \\"I have a friend who lives down the street, and she said it was horrifying to hear.\\" Many mothers immediately beat up on themselves when they learn their children are battling addiction. Brenda Stewart with her sons Richard and Jeremy, who both battled addiction and are now doing well. Brenda Stewart of Worthington, Ohio, says it was heartbreaking realizing two of her three kids were addicts. Her son Jeremy, now 29, used prescription drugs and then heroin, and the drug of choice for Richard, now 31, was crystal meth, she said. \\"I've been going to counseling for years to figure out what I did wrong. It's just like, 'What did I do?'\\" said Stewart, who has adopted Jeremy's two children, ages 5 and 7. \\"And then you come to find out through tons of counseling and parents' groups and everything else that this is something you didn't do to your children. And that's the hardest thing to get away from because you always feel responsible.\\" Debbie Gross Longo's son started taking prescription drugs at 15. Debbie Gross Longo, whose son started using drugs at 13 and taking prescription drugs at 15, says the powerlessness of being an addict's mom is worse than people might imagine. \\"As a mother, it's been hell,\\" said the mom of four in Stony Brook, New York. \\"It's like having a child that you cannot help and sitting on the edge of your seat all at the time because you know something might happen.\\" Viewing addiction as a disease was instrumental, many mothers say, in helping understand they didn't cause their child's addiction and couldn't fix it either. \\"When you really start to understand that it is a disease ... you can start looking at your child in a different way, loving them for who they are and hating the disease,\\" said Stewart. Sadly, the stigma of having a child with addiction is all too real and incredibly painful. Announce to your community your child has a disease like cancer and people will jump to help, said mothers I interviewed. Not so when you tell them your child is an addict. \\"There are no little girls selling cookies for addiction. Nobody has bumper stickers on their car,\\" said Theodosiou. Her son Daniel was in the church group. \\"When they found out he was an addict, the entire church shunned him. He was completely not invited anywhere.\\" 'The hardest thing in the entire world' Every mom I spoke with talked about the intense struggle between supporting their addicted child or children and not enabling their destructive habit. It is \\"the hardest thing in the entire world,\\" said Theodosiou, who said it was only after seven years and 30-plus stints in rehab that she knew she had to make a drastic change. \\"All of these people were telling me you have to stop enabling Daniel. You need to let Daniel go. You need to just stop. ... I had to actually face leaving Daniel on the street,\\" she said. \\"I finally spoke to a pastor and an addiction specialist who told me that ... the last person in the world who could ever help Daniel is me.\\" Melva Sherwood's son Aaron works full-time in marketing and sales and may pursue a career in nutrition. Sherwood, who lost one son to a drug overdose and has another son who battled drug addiction, said she was never able to cut off her children completely, but she set limits. \\"As far as enabling, I think you need to lay it on the table for them. This is what you can do. Here are your options but I'm not going to sit here and let you take advantage of me and lie to me,\\" said Sherwood, who is a registered nurse and the owner of a business providing caregivers for in-home assisted living. Stewart, whose two sons were addicts, said she eventually realized the longer she enabled her children, the longer they weren't going to face the consequences. \\"It took the line in the sand, telling them I love them and if they were ever ready to get the help and really wanted it that I'm here for them ... but I'm not going to set up another appointment,\\" she said. But the enabling isn't just about the addicts, said Stewart. Parents need to realize they are enabling themselves and are risking losing everything by thinking they can save their children. \\"There are moms losing their lives to save their children. ... They're spending their whole paycheck trying to take care of their child. They're not taking care of themselves. That's just a ripple effect.\\" Finding support from other moms Theodosiou went through the range of emotions that most mothers of addicts experience: the guilt followed by the intense sadness and then the anger. \\"It's just a very, very sad and a very lonely place,\\" she said. Then, one day about a year and a half into her new kind of normal with two sons who were addicted, she had a conversation with God. \\"I said, you know, God, if my sons are going to be living this life and be destroyed by this, I'm going to tell every mother and help every mother I can think of. I'm not going to keep it a secret.\\" She headed to Facebook and started a group called The Addict's Mom in 2008. Her friend thought she was insane. \\"She was like, 'Are you crazy? You are going to go on Facebook and say that you are an addict's mom?' And I said, 'You know what, I am and I know there have to be a million mothers just like me who are addicts' moms.'\\" CNN\\"s Kelly Wallace did lengthy interviews with mothers across the country whose children battled addiction. Six years later, The Addict's Mom, with its Facebook group, its fan page and its online community, has more than 20,000 members, with chapters in every state. Stewart is the state coordinator in Ohio for The Addict's Mom. \\"It's given me a place that I feel at home, a place that I feel I can give back,\\" she said. \\"I also understand the parent's pain and for me if I can help one parent ease that pain, then I've done something.\\" Sherwood, who's an administrator for the Facebook group, said the online community was an \\"unbelievable eye opener.\\" \\"It was just like somebody turned on the light in the closet,\\" she said. \\"It gave me such comfort to ... be able to put something out there online at any time during the day and have 20 people respond back with, 'Hey, we know. We've been where you're at. We feel for you. We're praying for you.' \\" \\"It definitely was a life-changing experience.\\" 'If you can't afford it, jail is your treatment' Besides providing invaluable comfort and support, The Addict's Mom is a resource center with information on low and no-cost rehabs, psychologists and sober living environments. This month, the group is launching weekly online video meetings where mothers can call in from all over the country and talk with experts on addiction. The group has also launched offshoots, including The Addict's Mom Healthy Moms, where the focus is solely on helping the mom live a healthy life (\\"We don't even talk about the addict there,\\" said Theodosiou) and The Addict's Mom Grieving Moms for mothers who lost children to addiction. It's also started The Addict's Dad for fathers and a group called The Addict for the addicts to talk directly with each other. A big focus now, the moms I interviewed said, is raising awareness about the problem of drug addiction and finding affordable solutions. Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life. \\"There is treatment if you're rich and if you can afford it,\\" said Theodosiou. \\"If you can't afford it, jail is your treatment.\\" The Addict's Mom is starting programs in states including New York, Kentucky and Ohio, where moms go into schools and educate students about addiction. The member moms are also flexing their lobbying muscles, advocating for laws such as legislation that allows a judge to order a person into treatment if a family member feels that person is a danger to himself or others. \\"Our children are dying and at such an alarming rate,\\" said Theodosiou, noting how the day before our conversation there were two posts on The Addict's Mom with reports that two children died. \\"We are seeing an alarming rate of death in our society. We have to break the stigma. It's a disease,'\\" said Theodosiou. \\"They are not bad people. We have to get the word out.\\" Raising awareness and helping other mothers drives members of The Addict's Mom, but they are also always mindful of the lifelong battle their children are facing. Sherwood's surviving son is doing well, she said, working full-time in marketing and sales, and planning to take a nutritional coaching course for a possible career in nutrition. \\"Today, I have my son back as he learns and implements the plan he has put into place with nutrition, exercise and being with those that truly love him and support his journey toward a better life,\\" said Sherwood. \\"What more could a parent ask for!\\" Stewart's son Jeremy has been in recovery for over two years. He's engaged, is getting ready to buy a house and is very active with his two children. \\"Our hope is that in the very near future they are back with their father,\\" said Stewart, who currently cares for her son's kids. Her older son, Richard, is also doing well, and has been in treatment since the end of June. Gross Longo's son, now 25, had been in recovery for six months and just recently relapsed. He entered a detox program and is starting again on the road to recovery, his mother said. \\"I am once again heartbroken,\\" she said. \\"(My son) is doing what he needs to do to get well, but do you understand how this is a day-to-day, year-to-year fight?\\" Before her son's relapse, Gross Longo told me she was so pleased about his recovery but also very cautious. \\"They could change on a dime,\\" she said. \\"They could be doing wonderful for five years ... and then one evening it's gone.\\" Theodosiou's older son, Peter, has been in recovery for 3½ years and is a recent college graduate. He will soon begin a master's program in speech pathology. Her younger son, Daniel, had been in rehab for five weeks -- his longest time ever in treatment -- but recently relapsed, breaking the condition of his release from jail so he is back behind bars. \\"I am really sad about Daniel,\\" said Theodosiou. Despite her son's setback, she continues to advocate for other moms of addicts, but also gets some much needed help for herself. A few days before our conversation, a member of The Addict's Mom called her and expressed concern. \\"She said, 'Barbara, we're worried about you.' And I said, 'Why?' And she said, 'Because you have to take care of yourself. You help so many other people.'\\" \\"I still struggle with being OK and with my own issues and they help by reminding me, by being there, by being able to talk to them, by sharing resources and supporting me.\\" Have any of your loved ones ever been addicted to prescription drugs?

Choices: (A). protons and electrons grouped together in a random pattern. (B). protons and electrons grouped together in an alternating pattern. (C). a core of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons. (D). a core of electrons and neutrons surrounded by protons.","response":"The best description for an atom among the given choices is (C). a core of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons. An atom is the basic unit of matter that consists of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles have different properties and are organized in a specific manner within the atom. Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus, which is the central part of the atom. Neutrons are neutral particles, having no charge, and they are also located in the nucleus along with protons. The protons and neutrons together are referred to as nucleons, and they account for almost all of the mass of an atom. The number of protons in an atom, also known as the atomic number, determines the type of element it represents. Surrounding the nucleus is a cloud of electrons, which are negatively charged particles. Electrons are much smaller and lighter than protons or neutrons, and they orbit the nucleus at various energy levels, called electron shells or orbitals. The distribution of electrons in these orbitals follows specific rules and patterns, with each shell having a certain capacity for holding electrons. The electric charges on protons and electrons are responsible for the way they interact with one another, and these interactions are critical in determining the chemical properties of elements and compounds. The electrons in the outermost shell, known as valence electrons, are particularly important for chemical reactivity, since they are the ones that participate in chemical bonds with other atoms. In summary, an atom consists of a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons at its core and is surrounded by electrons, which circulate in specific energy levels around the nucleus. Therefore, choice (C) accurately describes the structure of an atom."},{"question":"Information: - Operation Banner was the operational name for the British Armed Forces ' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007 .

During the Troubles, 319 members of the RUC were killed and almost 9,000 injured in paramilitary assassinations or attacks, mostly by the Provisional IRA, which made, by 1983, the RUC the most dangerous police force in the world in which to serve. In the same period, the RUC killed 55 people, 28 of whom were civilians. - The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom.

Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency. - The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) or Belfast Agreement (or ; Ulster-Scots: \\"Guid Friday Greeance\\" or \\"Bilfawst Greeance\\") was a major political development in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s. - The government of Northern Ireland is, generally speaking, whatever political body exercises political authority over Northern Ireland.

Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\". - A paramilitary is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not included as part of a state's formal armed forces. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace.

A separate civic police force, the unarmed Dublin Metropolitan Police controlled the capital, and the cities of Derry and Belfast, originally with their own police forces, later had special divisions within the RIC. About seventy-five percent of the RIC were Roman Catholic and about twenty-five percent were of various Protestant denominations, the Catholics mainly constables and the Protestants officers. The RIC's successful system of policing influenced the armed Canadian North-West Mounted Police (predecessor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), the armed Victoria Police force in Australia, and the armed Royal Newfoundland Constabulary in Newfoundland. In consequence of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the RIC was disbanded in 1922 and was replaced by the Garda Síochána in the Irish Free State and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland. What is the relationship between 'operation banner' and 'the troubles'? The answer to this question is:","response":"Operation Banner was the operational name for the British Armed Forces' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007. It was deployed to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in maintaining law and order, and to assert the authority of the UK government in Northern Ireland. The main opposition to the British military's deployment came from the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), which waged a guerrilla campaign against the British military from 1970-97. The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century, which started in the late 1960s and is usually considered to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The conflict mainly took place in Northern Ireland, but violence occasionally spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe. Thus, the relationship between Operation Banner and the Troubles is that Operation Banner was the British military's response to the violence and unrest during the Troubles. The operation aimed to maintain stability, support the government and law enforcement, and counteract the activities of paramilitary groups like the IRA."},{"question":"Barbara: How are you today?

Question: Jim and Kelly took their kids to watch the fireworks show. They wanted to make sure their kids didn't experience loud sounds that might damage their hearing. In order to do this where would the family stand and observe? (A) In the front row of the crowd (B) in the back of the crowd The answer is:","response":"The answer is (B) in the back of the crowd. Jim and Kelly's primary concern in this scenario is to protect their kids from loud sounds that could potentially harm their hearing. Fireworks can produce noise levels ranging from 150 to 175 decibels (dB), which could significantly damage hearing if people are exposed to these sounds at a close proximity. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), repeated or prolonged exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause noise-induced hearing loss over time. It is essential for the family to maintain a safe distance from the fireworks show. In choosing between standing in the front row of the crowd or the back, it's clear that option (B) in the back of the crowd is the best choice for the following reasons: 1. Increased distance: Standing further away from the fireworks will provide a greater buffer against loud sounds. This allows for sound waves to disperse and reduce in intensity as they travel, lowering the noise level that reaches the family. 2. Decreased sound pressure: As the distance from the source of sound (in this case, the fireworks) increases, the sound pressure levels that reach the family will decrease. This helps in reducing the risk of noise-induced hearing loss. 3. Better vantage point: Standing at the back of the crowd might not only offer safety from the loud sounds but may also provide a better overall viewing experience of the fireworks show. This is because the fireworks often explode high in the sky and can be seen more comfortably with an upward gaze. 4. Crowd management: It is generally easier to find a suitable space and manage the kids in the back of the crowd. Families at the front have to deal with noise, as well as enthusiastic audience members, so maintaining a safer distance will offer a more relaxed environment for the children. In conclusion, to ensure that their kids do not experience loud sounds that might damage their hearing, Jim and Kelly should opt to stand and observe the fireworks show from the back of the crowd. This will provide a safer distance from the fireworks, reduce the noise intensity, and potentially enhance their overall experience of the event."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: The unidentified girl is undergoing psychiatric evaluation and will be charged as a juvenile with making terroristic threats.

In this case, there are -9 and +9 on the left side, which cancel each other out: -286*j = 9*j Step 2: Move all terms with j to one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 286*j to both sides: -286*j + 286*j = 9*j + 286*j This simplifies to: 0 = 295*j Step 3: To solve for j, divide both sides of the equation by 295: 0/295 = 295*j/295 This simplifies to: 0 = j So, the solution for the equation -286*j - 9 + 9 = 9*j is j = 0."},{"question":"Data: Italy DEMONYM Italians; Italy CAPITAL Rome; Italy LEADER_NAME Matteo Renzi; Amatriciana sauce COUNTRY Italy; Italy LEADER_NAME Laura Boldrini What would a sentence about this data be like?","response":"The Italian people, who predominantly reside in the beautiful country of Italy with its capital Rome, enjoy the widely celebrated Amatriciana sauce as a quintessential aspect of their culinary heritage, under the leadership of prominent figures like Matteo Renzi, the former Prime Minister, and Laura Boldrini, the former President of the Chamber of Deputies, who have both played significant roles in governing the nation and shaping its trajectory in various aspects, including politics, culture, and foreign relations."},{"question":"Review: I have seen this movie a while back, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big Dominic Monaghan fan.

The band's discography has grown to thirty-eight albums, including sixteen studio albums, twelve live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations. Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live Context: On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge. Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs, the band presented a copy to Neal Kay, then managing a heavy metal club called \\"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London. Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \\"Prowler\\", eventually went to No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine. A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager, and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club. Featuring only three tracks (one song, \\"Strange World\\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production) all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks. In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend Adrian Smith of Urchin to join the group as their second guitarist. Smith declined as he was busy with his own band, Urchin, so Iron Maiden hired guitarist Dennis Stratton instead. Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December. Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Wrathchild\\". The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal. Iron Maiden's eponymous 1980 release, Iron Maiden, debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart. In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the first music videos aired on MTV), the album includes other early favourites such as \\"Running Free\\", \\"Transylvania\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", and \\"Sanctuary\\" - which was not on the original UK release but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band set out on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with UFO headlining. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences, and was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980. In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second album, entitled Killers. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (the latter's title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe). Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album, the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch, who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992. The record was followed by the band's first world tour, which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas. Question: Is that when they made their first album?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, Iron Maiden made their first album called \\"Iron Maiden\\" in 1980.

Doctors who spoke at a \\"Zeroing in on Zika: From the Front Lines\\" forum Thursday said they have asked each woman to go public about their diagnosis and discuss their concerns, but only one has agreed to do so. The University of Miami is taking a leading role in dealing with the Zika virus outbreak, launching the Zika Global Network. Doctors said they expect to see an influx of Florida babies born to mothers who contracted the virus in about five or six months. The forum came a day after doctors confirmed that a baby was born with microcephaly at Jackson Memorial Hospital. In total, 15 pregnant women who have delivered at the hospital have tested positive for the mosquito-borne virus, Dr. Christine Curry said. Those women are being monitored by doctors at the hospital. \\"Zika is a thing. Zika is real, and while we don't understand it fully, that is not a reason to dismiss its impact,\\" Curry said Wednesday at a Miami Beach Commission meeting. So far, there have been 604 travel-related infections confirmed in the state and 56 locally acquired cases, with the majority being contracted in Miami-Dade County. Pregnant women who live in or have to traveled to South Florida are urged to wear insect repellent, long clothing and limit their time outdoors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged doctors in Florida to test all pregnant women for the virus, and pregnant women can also contact their local county health department for a Zika risk assessment and testing hours and information. Health officials said they have monitoring pregnant women \\"with evidence of Zika regardless of (their) symptoms.\\" Copyright 2016 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved. ||||| (CNN) A plane flying over Miami Beach on Friday conducted aerial spraying for mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus, despite concerns over possible effects that the insecticide naled may have on health and the environment. Since the mosquito that carries Zika is most active at predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. So far, there have been 56 local transmissions of the Zika virus in Florida , which has 20.6 million residents. The state has seen 596 travel-related cases of Zika, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The virus can cause neurological disorders in unborn children Health officials have sprayed pesticide and larvicide on the ground in areas where they believe the mosquitoes may be, and are expanding those efforts with the aerial use of naled. The spraying was originally scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed for a day after concerned residents protested. Andres Blanco wasn't among those protesting. A valet at South Beach's landmark Clevelander Hotel, Blanco said he wasn't scared. \\"No way man, I think it's good!\\" The longtime Miami Beach resident said. \\"They've got to do something to kill those mosquitoes.\\" Naled used since 1950s Experts say there's no reason to be concerned over the effects of the insecticide on human health and the environment.

Peter Beach, who describes himself as a closet anarchist, condemned the spraying. South Beach resident Peter Beach, 62, said he is really angry about the spraying. Beach, who described himself as a closet anarchist, voiced contempt for the EPA and CDC approval of naled, the main chemical in the insecticide Dibrom. \\"This is a toxic substance that kills everything,\\" he said. \\"You think these tourists on the beach know they are lying on sand that was hit with a toxic carcinogenic hours earlier? No way.\\" The US has used naled since the 1950s, and sprays it on about 16 million acres nationwide annually. Health officials use it to prevent mosquitoes after disasters such as hurricanes and floods, according to the CDC. Naled breaks down swiftly in water and sunlight, and its chemicals don't cause health problems in people or pets if used in small quantities, according to the CDC. #ZIKA: Protesters gathering for 2nd day at Miami Beach City Hall; upset about planned #Naled aerial spraying. @NBC6 pic.twitter.com/sDivk7mqc7 — Michael Spears NBC6 (@MikeSpearsNBC6) September 8, 2016 Sprayers produce fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.

New Yorker Tristan Mullings was determined to take his vacation but didn't bargain on the spraying. Tristan Mullings, 27, was visiting from Brooklyn. He was aware of the Zika outbreak before he came -- \\"I can't let no mosquito ruin my vacation\\" -- but unaware they would be spraying Friday morning. He voiced concern when he learned the chemicals had been linked by some to neurological disorders \\"Then I think the spraying is worse (than Zika),\\" he said. Janet McDonald, an English teacher in Mexico who was in Miami vacationing with a friend from Canada, said spraying was worth the risk compared to the risks posed by a mosquito-born disease. \\"Am I scared?\\" said McDonald, referring to naled. \\"No, I've had Dengue fever, that is scary.\\" Rita Doto of Toronto (left) and Janet McDonald were in South Beach \\"for a girls weekend\\" and not worried about naled. \\"I don't know too much about (naled) said Doto, \\"I hear it's bad, but so is Zika.\\" Growing fears The presence of Zika-carrying mosquitoes in Florida has sparked fears, especially after Gov. Rick Scott announced in July that the first local transmission of the virus in the continental United States occurred north of downtown Miami. A few days later, in an unprecedented move, the CDC announced a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit that area. Authorities launched aggressive mosquito-control measures, including spraying in the area. JUST WATCHED Mosquito samples test positive for Zika in Miami Beach Replay More Videos ...

Pregnant women are at greatest risk because the virus can have devastating consequences for an unborn baby, including the birth defect microcephaly and other neurological disorders, as well as miscarriage and stillbirth among women infected while pregnant. In addition to human health, critics say naled kills pollinators and wildlife, and is toxic to the environment. South Carolina beekeeper Juanita Stanley recently lost more than 3 million bees when Summerville officials aerially sprayed a small area of the town for Zika-carrying mosquitoes. \\"In the summertime, the bees are already out at dawn, when aerial spraying is recommended,\\" said entomologist Jeffrey Harris, who runs the Honey Bee Extension and Research Program for Mississippi State University. \\"So spraying in the morning is the worst thing they can do for bees.\\" ||||| Florida has 744 reported cases of the Zika virus, with 12 new cases involving people who contracted the disease outside of the state, the Florida Department of Health reported Thursday. There were no new cases of locally transmitted Zika, with 56 previously reported. Health officials have identified two areas in Miami-Dade County, including part of Miami Beach, where they believe local transmission is occurring. Investigations, including door-to-door surveys and targeted testing, are ongoing in Pinellas and Palm Beach counties and other areas of Miami-Dade County where people have contracted the virus locally. But health officials said the investigations have not identified additional \\"active transmission\\" zones. Four of the new travel-related cases involved pregnant women, which is a particular concern since Zika can lead to severe birth defects. Florida has identified a total of 84 pregnant women with the virus. There are another 604 cases of travel-related Zika, excluding the pregnant women, the Department of Health reported. The other new travel-related cases included three in Miami-Dade County, two in Alachua County and one each in Marion, Orange and Palm Beach counties. News Service of Florida ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Maggie Fox Small aircraft started predawn spraying of insecticide to kill Zika-carrying mosquitoes in Miami Beach Friday morning. The spraying had been delayed a day after worried and angry residents complained to city officials and organized a small protest outside City Hall. Hours after spraying ended, the mayor's office announced that a fresh pool of mosquitoes had tested positive for the virus. A map shows the mosquito spraying zone in Miami Beach. Miami-Dade County Officials assured residents the insecticide, called naled, is safe for people in the amounts being sprayed, and the pre-dawn application would minimize effects on beneficial insects such as bees. \\"The fact that a fourth Zika-positive mosquito pool has been identified in Miami Beach serves as further confirmation that we must continue our proactive and aggressive approach to controlling the mosquito population, including our recent decision to begin aerial spraying in combination with larvicide treatment by truck,\\" Mayor Carlos Gimenez said. Related: What's Behind the Bogus Zika Rumors Miami-Dade County's Mosquito Control team flew small planes just off the beach, using winds to disperse the insecticide across the targeted area. They’ll spray again Sunday and the next two weekends, Gimenez said. “This schedule will minimize disruption to our school children and families,’ he said in a statement. Related: Should I Worry About Zika? Miami Beach is fighting a small outbreak of locally spread Zika virus, which is carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Florida’s got 56 confirmed local cases so far, and travelers are diagnosed with infections acquired overseas daily. At least 84 pregnant women in Florida have been diagnosed with Zika. “When applied according to label instructions, naled can be used for public health mosquito control programs without posing risks to people.\\" There’s no doubt Zika virus causes brain damage and other birth defects in developing fetuses. The most notable is microcephaly – an abnormally small head caused when the developing brain is destroyed by the virus. Other, less obvious, damage has been seen, also. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and independent academic researchers say naled is safe to use to kill mosquitoes when it’s applied in such small amounts. Related: Zika Money is Running Out “When applied according to label instructions, naled can be used for public health mosquito control programs without posing risks to people. People aren’t likely to breathe or touch anything that has enough insecticide on it to harm them,” the CDC says. But a small and vocal group of protesters say they don’t believe the pesticide is safe and also question the links between Zika and birth defects. “Given the mounting evidence disproving a direct link between Zika and microcephaly, it’s time to stop the unnecessary aerial spraying of Naled,” a group calling itself “Floridians AGAINST spraying of Naled” says in an online petition that had gathered 7,900 signatures as of Friday. In fact, the opposite is true. Many studies have now confirmed that Zika virus directly infects developing brain cells, destroying them. The virus has been found in the brains and bodies of fetuses from women infected with Zika, and in the blood and urine of babies born with Zika-related syndromes. Related: Meet a Woman Who Lost her Baby to Zika CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden has been pushing to persuade communities the worst hit by Zika virus to use both pesticides such as naled and larvicides, which target the developing mosquitoes. The approach has helped control an outbreak of Zika in Miami's nearby Wynwood neighborhood, Frieden says. \\"What we have seen is a very dramatic reduction in populations of the Aedes mosquitos there,\\" Frieden said. ||||| When people in a large area are getting sick or when large numbers of mosquitoes are found, airplanes can be used to treat very large areas with insecticides safely, quickly, and efficiently. This process is called aerial spraying. Below is more information on aerial spraying. Aerial Spraying and Mosquito Control Is aerial spraying an effective tool for killing mosquitoes? Aerial treatment of areas with products that rapidly reduce both adult mosquitoes and their larvae that carry the Zika virus can be effective. Repeated aerial applications of insecticide has reduced mosquito populations as a part of an integrated mosquito management program. Is aerial spraying alone the best way to control mosquitoes? Aerial spraying is only one part of the solution for controlling mosquitoes, but it is the one method that can rapidly reduce the number of mosquitoes spreading Zika in a large area. It is the most effective method when large areas must be treated quickly. Aerial spraying is used as part of an integrated mosquito control program to quickly reduce the number of mosquitoes responsible for infecting people with viruses like Zika, dengue, or chikungunya. An integrated mosquito control program includes Source reduction. Eliminating mosquito habitats, such as discarded containers and rain gutters. Structural barriers, such as screens and enclosed, air-conditioned spaces, if possible. Larval mosquito control using the appropriate methods for the habitat. Adult mosquito control using insecticides. Community education efforts related to preventing mosquito bites by wearing EPA-registered insect repellents and protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts and long pants). Aerial Spraying and Insecticides How is an insecticide chosen for use in aerial spraying? State and local officials make the decision on what insecticide(s) to use for aerial spraying. The decision is based on the results of insecticide resistance testing in the target area. Is aerial spraying experimental? Aerial spraying is not experimental. EPA-registered insecticides are used for aerial spraying. EPA-registered insecticides have been studied for their effectiveness and safety when used according to label instructions. Aerial spraying, using Naled and other insecticides, has been used in many populated areas of the continental United States, including Miami, Tampa, and New Orleans, to help control mosquitoes. In 2014, almost 6 million acres of land in Florida was aerial sprayed with Naled by mosquito control programs. Where has Naled been used? Naled has been extensively used since the 1950s and is currently applied by aerial and ground spraying to an average of approximately 16 million acres of the continental United States annually. It is also used for mosquito control following natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods. (Human Exposure to Mosquito-Control Pesticides ― Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia, 2002 and 2003, CDC, 2005) In 2004 and 2005, it was used as part of the emergency responses to Hurricanes Charley, Jeanne, Frances, and Katrina. Naled is currently used in the United States by many local governments and mosquito control districts, including the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, the Lee County Mosquito Control District, and Miami-Dade County. Historically, Naled has been used in Puerto Rico in attempts to control dengue. What happens to Naled once it is sprayed? Naled starts to degrade (break down) immediately on surfaces, in water, and in sunlight. The chemical dichlorvos (DDVP) can be created when Naled degrades. It also breaks down quickly. In small quantities DDVP has not been shown to cause health problems in people. DDVP does not build up in breast milk or breast tissue. What is Bti and how does it work? Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti) is a naturally occurring bacteria found in soils. Bti produces toxins that kill the larvae of mosquitoes and blackflies when swallowed. The toxins cause death by starvation and only begin working when swallowed by certain insects (larvae of mosquitoes, blackflies, and fungus gnats). There are several strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that kill other insect larva like caterpillars and beetles. These are not the same as Bti. Can Bti only be applied through aerial spraying? No, Bti is often applied using methods that are not aerial spraying. Bti can be applied using truck-mounted or backpack spraying. It can also be found as dunks or briquettes that can be put in areas of standing water that cannot be emptied, such as fountains and ornamental ponds, septic tanks, and unchlorinated pools. Dunks are currently being distributed in Zika prevention kits. Aerial Spraying and Organic Farming Is Bti harmful to crops? Bti is not toxic to people. It has not been shown to make people sick. When used as directed, Bti can be applied safely to standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs without causing harm to food crops or water supplies. Bti is EPA-registered for use in residential, commercial, and agricultural settings. Organic farming operations use Bti. Aerial Spraying and Human Health Is aerial spraying of insecticides dangerous/harmful to human health? No, during aerial spraying, a small amount of insecticide is sprayed over an area, about 1 ounce (two tablespoons) per acre or about the size of a football field. This small amount does not pose a health risk to people or pets in the area that is sprayed. When aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not cause asthma attacks. There is a possibility that spraying of a larvicide, like Bti, can cause eye irritation if a person is outside and looking up when spraying takes place. EPA-registered products are used for aerial spraying. The label instructions are followed by a licensed professional. If people prefer to stay inside and close windows and doors when spraying takes place they can, but it is not necessary. Does aerial spraying cause asthma attacks? No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not cause asthma attacks. When applied according to label instructions, EPA-registered insecticides do not pose a risk to human health or the environment. Research shows that ultra-low volume (ULV) application for mosquito control does not increase the risk of asthma for people living in treatment areas (Karpati et al. 2004, Currier et al. 2005, Duprey et al. 2008). Will Naled cause cancer? No, EPA has classified Naled as Group E “Evidence of Non-carcinogenicity for Humans,” meaning that there is no evidence that it causes cancer in people. During aerial spraying, a small amount of insecticide is sprayed over an area, about 1 ounce (two tablespoons) per acre or about the size of a football field. Droplets float in the air and kill adult mosquitoes on contact. Naled starts to degrade (break down) immediately on surfaces, in water, and in sunlight. EPA conducted risk assessments for Naled and calculated risks under different exposure scenarios. Because of the very small amount of active ingredient released per acre of ground during aerial spraying, EPA found that for all scenarios and exposures were hundreds or thousands of times below an amount that might pose a health concern. In an evaluation of thousands of people who conducted agricultural spraying using many types of insecticides, including organophosphates like Naled, no increased risk of any type of cancer was found during the 7-11 years of follow up (Schinasi & Leon, 2008). However, at high doses, for example if the person doing the spraying is exposed to Naled directly in amounts that are well above those for normal labeled uses, Naled and other organophosphates can overstimulate the nervous system, causing nausea, dizziness, or confusion. This is why it is very important that those who actually work with Naled strictly follow label instructions. Severe high-dose poisoning with any organophosphate can cause convulsions, respiratory paralysis, and death. It is extremely unlikely that any person would come into contact with this amount of Naled when it is applied by a licensed professional according to label instructions. Will Bti affect human health? Bti has not been found to pose a health risk to people or pets. There is a possibility that spraying larvicides, like Bti, can cause eye irritation if a person is outside when spraying takes place. Bti is an EPA-registered insecticide. EPA-registered insecticides have been studied for their effectiveness and safety when used according to label instructions. Existing residential and area-wide uses, like aerial or truck spraying, have been evaluated and found to be safe. Using Bti to kill mosquito larvae may reduce the risk of getting infected with Zika virus. If people prefer to stay inside when spraying takes place they can, but it is not necessary. Aerial Spraying and Animals Will aerial spraying hurt pets and other animals? No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not harm animals. During aerial spraying, a small amount of insecticide is sprayed over an area, about 1 ounce (two tablespoons) per acre, or about the size of a football field. This small amount does not pose a health risk to people or pets in the area that is sprayed. EPA-registered products are used for aerial spraying. The label instructions are followed by a licensed professional. If people prefer to bring pets inside when spraying takes place they can, but it is not necessary. Aerial spraying will not harm fish or animals that live in the water. People do not need to cover fishponds when spraying takes place. If a larvicide is sprayed, it is better if ponds are not covered. Will aerial spraying kill bees? Aerial spraying can be done in ways that minimize risk to bees. Spraying Naled can kill bees outside of their hives at the time of spraying; therefore, spraying is limited to dawn or dusk when bees are inside their hives. Because Naled breaks down quickly, it does not pose a risk to the honey bee populations. Studies show that honey production between hives in treated and untreated sites did not show significantly different quantities of honey over the course of a season. For additional protection, urban bee keepers inside the spray zone can cover their hives when spraying occurs. Although significant exposure to bees would not occur with Naled application at dawn and dusk, beekeepers can reduce potential exposure to bee colonies even more by covering colonies and preventing bees from exiting during designated treatment periods or, if possible, relocating colonies to an untreated site. The spraying of mosquito larvicides will not impact bees. Will aerial spraying kill birds or other animals? No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not harm birds or other animals. The insecticides used for aerial spraying do not pose risks to wildlife or the environment. Aerial spraying does not cause long-term harm to the environment or local ecosystem, even if spraying happens more than once. EPA-registered insecticides used for aerial spraying break down rapidly in the environment, and it displays low toxicity to birds and mammals. Aerial spraying will not harm coquis or fish or animals that live in the water. People do not need to cover fish ponds when spraying takes place. If a larvicide is sprayed, it is better if ponds are not covered. Will Bti affect animals or wildlife? No, Bti does not pose a risk to other mammals, birds, or aquatic life, including coqui frogs in Puerto Rico and USVI. The toxins it produces only begin working once swallowed by certain insects (larvae of mosquitoes, blackflies, and fungus gnats). Aerial Spraying and the Environment Will aerial spraying pollute water? No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not pollute water. Research shows that, when applied according to label instructions, EPA-registered insecticides sprayed in low levels (about two tablespoons per acre [4,046 square meters]) does not cause long-term harm to the environment or local ecosystem, even if spraying happens more than once. Will chemicals from aerial spraying contaminate soil? No, when chemicals used in aerial spraying are used correctly, they will not contaminate soil. Aerial spraying does not cause harm to the environment or local ecosystem, even if spraying happens more than once. When applied according to label instructions, EPA-registered insecticides do not pose a risk to human health or the environment. More information can be found on the US Environmental Protection Agency’s website. Is Bti harmful to crops or water supplies? Bti is not toxic to people. It has not been shown to make people sick. When used as directed, Bti can be applied safely to standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs without causing harm to food crops or water supplies. Bti is EPA-registered for use in residential, commercial, and agricultural settings. Organic farming operations use Bti. Multiple Bti products are available for use. Some can be used by pest control professionals in certain drinking water storage containers (e.g., cisterns) while others are not EPA-registered for that use. Always follow label instructions. It is important to follow the label for any Bti product to ensure that the product is being used correctly. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Florida health officials have confirmed that 84 pregnant women have tested positive for the Zika virus in the state.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the review's components and why I assigned this rating: 1. Positive sentiment towards the app: The reviewer mentioned that they \\"loved the app\\" which shows their satisfaction and enjoyment while using the app. This implies that the app has delivered on its intended purpose and met the user's expectations up until a certain point. This aspect of the review would contribute towards a higher rating. 2. Negative experience with the app crashing: The review discusses a significant issue with the app where it crashed, restarted, and erased the user's prior data. The user referred to this as \\"crucial accounts update\\" which might have caused major inconvenience or even potential loss. This negative experience would contribute towards lowering the overall rating, as it indicates that there might be some issues with the app's stability or data management. 3. Issue with outdated backup: The reviewer also expressed their concern over the fact that the previous backup was over a week old, and thus, all the recent changes had not been saved. This point highlights that the app might have an insufficient data backup mechanism or a problem with the cloud syncing functionality. It adds to the negative aspects that would lower the rating. In conclusion, the rating of 3 out of 5 considers both the positive sentiment expressed by the user and the negative experiences with the app. While the app seemed to have initially delighted the user, the subsequent crashing, data loss, and backup issues contributed to a less favorable overall rating. This score suggests that there's room for improvement in terms of stability and data management, to provide users with a seamless and trustworthy experience."},{"question":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute at the age of five? from the following article ? Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: \\"I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the... The answer is:","response":"To find the answer to the given question, I will first identify the relevant information within the text. The question asks for the last name of the person who joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute at the age of five. The text mentions: \\"In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years.\\" Thus, I can determine that the person of interest is a female. I will now search for any last names mentioned in the text to see if they can be associated with this person. Checking the text again, I find the following references to last names: 1. \\"Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.\\" 2. \\"In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.\\" From these sentences, I can infer that the person mentioned earlier is Imogen, as she is the only female mentioned with a connection to both Gustav Holst and the Froebel Institute at age five. Since the question asks for the last name, and Gustav Holst is her father, I can conclude that the answer to the question is: The answer is: Holst."},{"question":"Q:Article: Michael Jordan was born on February 17,1963 in Brooklym ,N.Y.

Why? No, it wasn’t a threat by terrorists, right-wing crazies or rabid fans, but a personal drone. According to NBC News, Obama had just finished playing golf and was heading back to his family’s vacation home when his U.S. Secret Service detail noticed the low-flying drone near the motorcade: The Secret Service quickly intervened and said the pilot of the small, quadcopter-style drone was “completely unaware” that Obama’s motorcade would be traveling through the area on Oahu. The man “immediately complied with law enforcement requests to cease and desist,” the statement added. No charges were filed and the motorcade did not stop or slow down because of the incident. It was just some guy with a personal drone, probably snooping on beach goers with its attached camera’s advanced zoom capabilities. Besides, would someone wearing a muscle t-shirt with the words “Laid Back, Easy Goin'” branded on it mean any ill will towards the president? Trigger-happy survivalists hell-bent on equipping every man, woman and child in America with a gun would probably say yes. But me? I’m going to say no, the dude with the “Laid Back, Easy Goin'” shirt meant no harm towards the president and his motorcade. He’s like Hawaii’s Matthew McConaughey, though more of the Dazed and Confused McConaughey than the Mud McConaughey. He’s not brandishing any weapons, hiding away from society because of some crime he committed (or is about to commit). No, this guy is just livin’, man. L-I-V-I-N.

Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, while Nate has the Epstein–Barr virus. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cousin has a higher chance of developing body-cavity lymphoma? A:","response":"The cousin who has a higher chance of developing body-cavity lymphoma would be Tim, who is infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This is because Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), and is linked to the development of certain types of cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease. Primary effusion lymphoma, also known as body-cavity-based lymphoma, is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that develops in the body's cavities, such as the pleural, pericardial, or abdominal cavities. It is a very aggressive type of cancer that is commonly associated with immunosuppressed individuals, particularly those with HIV infection. The virus infects B cells, the type of white blood cells that are affected in body-cavity lymphoma, causing them to transform into cancerous cells. On the other hand, Nate is infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV4) and is one of the most common viruses that infect humans around the world. Although Epstein-Barr virus can also lead to certain types of cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and some types of lymphomas (including Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma), it's not specifically linked with body-cavity lymphoma as the KSHV/HHV8 viral infection is. Therefore, given the specific diseases associated with each virus, Tim, the cousin with KSHV/HHV8 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), would have a higher chance of developing body-cavity lymphoma. However, it's important to remember that carrying these viruses doesn't guarantee that one will develop these cancers; other factors, such as weakened immune system, genetics, co-infections, and environmental influences, also play important roles in cancer development."},{"question":"She ha money and an extravagant hat, where was she heading to gamble with it all?

Solve -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 for k.","response":"To solve the given equation for k, we need to isolate the variable k on one side of the equation. Let's follow the necessary steps to do so: Given equation: -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining the constant terms -2 and 19. -17*k + 17 = 0 Step 2: Add 17 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable. -17*k + 17 + 17 = 0 + 17 -17*k = 17 Step 3: To solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by -17. -17*k / -17 = 17 / -17 k = -1 Hence, the solution to the equation -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 is k = -1."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: – Five city and state officials were charged Wednesday with involuntary manslaughter over the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reports. They are Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon—the highest-ranking official to be charged in the water crisis so far, per the Detroit News—former Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, former City of Flint Water Department Manager Howard Croft, plus Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s Drinking Water Chief Liane Shekter-Smith and Water Supervisor Stephen Busch. Twelve people died after the city's water supply was changed to the Flint River in April 2014 and there was an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. Prosecutors allege that Lyon knew about the outbreak by at least Jan. 28, 2015, yet did not make the news public until a year later; he is charged with causing the Dec. 13, 2015, death of Robert Skidmore. All of the involuntary manslaughter charges are linked to Skidmore's death; the 85-year-old died after many cases of Legionnaires' disease had been diagnosed, but the public still had not been notified of the outbreak. Lyon is also charged with misconduct in office for allegedly telling an official to halt an analysis that would have helped figure out what caused the outbreak, the Detroit Free Press reports. Also Wednesday, Chief Medical Executive Dr. Eden Wells was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer; she is accused of giving false testimony to a special agent, lying to a peace officer about when she knew of the outbreak, and threatening to withhold funding for the Flint Area Community Health and Environment Partnership if it did not stop investigating the outbreak. Flint residents are still advised to use a filter if they plan to drink the city's tap water, and many use bottled water instead, which is distributed for free in the city.","response":"Once upon a time, in a city called Flint, in the state of Michigan, there was a serious problem with the water.

Now, some important people who were supposed to make sure the water was safe are in trouble. There are five of them, and they could go to jail for not taking care of the people of Flint. One of them, named Nick Lyon, knew about the dangerous water but didn't tell everyone right away. He's also accused of stopping someone from figuring out why the water was bad.

The following guest post is by Thomas Mueller, Chief Experience Officer for strategic branding firm Siegel+Gale. Though the definition is often hotly debated, most can agree that brand experience means ensuring you walk the talk. It’s that moment of truth when a customer has the right experience with your brand in the right channel, at the right time. It’s when the brand delivers on its promise. Here are six behaviors that will characterize winning brands in 2014. 1. Brands that deliver on their promises will win. Benjamin Franklin once said, “Promises may fit the friends, but non-performance will turn them into enemies.” And in the era of social media, if you alienate a customer, they can easily tell the world. Brands win by having a great purpose, a credible promise and actions that deliver on that promise. Nike, whose purpose is “to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world,” is an expert at keeping promises. The launch of the Nike+ platform has created products like the Fuelband, which allows an athlete to track the day, set a goal, see progress, stay motivated and tell the world. It’s an ingenious mix of inspiration and innovation—totally in line with Nike’s promise. Nike tells the world what it plans to do: “It is our nature to innovate,” “Simplify and go,” “The consumer decides,” “Evolve immediately,” “Do the right thing” and “We are on the offense—always.” And Nike walks that talk. Being consistent in your brand’s communications and interactions—keeping your promises—is at the core of building expert brand experiences. 2. Brands that make simplicity a value—not just a buzzword—will win. Albert Einstein’s three rules of work: “Out of clutter find simplicity. From discord find harmony. In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.” Simplicity is key to successful brand experiences. Our 2013 Global Brand Simplicity Index shows that in the US, UK and Germany alone, brands that offer increased simplicity stand to capture a share of 50 billion. And in the United States, 41% of people are willing to pay more for simpler experiences and interactions. IKEA understands the value of simplicity. Its founder hails from Smaland—a city that exemplifies the company’s shared values of clarity, humility, thrift and responsibility. IKEA creates countless simple and satisfying experiences for customers, including straightforward catalogues and clean-lined furniture that’s easy to assemble. The answer is clear: with their powerful potential to increase revenue and loyalty, simple experiences pay. 3. Brands that show empathy will win. Steve Jobs once said, “It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” This holds a lot of truth. However, I have been in too many business meetings where I’ve witnessed a dangerous misinterpretation of Jobs’s point. I agree with the “Don’t ask them what they want,” but I strongly disagree with “we know better what they need.” Being aware of and sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of your audiences is essential. Canadian Airline WestJet can teach us about empathy. In December 2013, the airline had a digital Santa Claus in the boarding area ask passengers what they most wanted for the holidays. When passengers arrived at their destination, their gifts rolled out on the baggage carousel to their delight, surprise and awe. The video capturing the stunt garnered more than 13 million views in more than 200 different countries. Clearly, WestJet captured the hearts and minds of not just their customers, but people everywhere. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"In 2014, brands that deliver on their promises, make simplicity a value, and show empathy will be successful. Examples of successful brands are Nike, which keeps its promises, and IKEA, which focuses on simplicity."},{"question":"Lee hired the applicant on the spot because there was not going to be anyone better. Given the context: Why did Lee do this? Possible answers: be wasteful, go home, be decisive A:","response":"Lee decided to hire the applicant on the spot because there was not going to be anyone better, demonstrating his ability to be decisive in a given context. Recognizing the quality and potential of the applicant, Lee understood that waiting or searching for other candidates would not yield better results. In a fast-paced business environment, making quick and well-informed decisions can be vital for an organization's progress and overall success. Hiring the applicant immediately displayed Lee's capability of identifying talent and seizing opportunities when they arise. When faced with a highly qualified candidate, it is natural for a leader to feel confident in their choice and trust their instincts. By being decisive, Lee saved not only time and resources but also brought the applicant on board before any competitors had the chance to recruit them. This decisive approach can have a significant positive impact on the organization's overall effectiveness, as it avoids the potential costs associated with prolonged recruitment processes or training new employees who are not as fitting for the role. In contrast, being wasteful would have entailed prolonging the hiring process, incurring unnecessary costs, and potentially missing out on a valuable addition to the team. Choosing to go home would have avoided making any decision, leaving the position unfilled and not taking advantage of an exceptional candidate. Ultimately, Lee's resolute decision to hire the applicant on the spot is a clear example of the importance of being decisive in leadership roles. It showcases the value in having the ability to recognize potential, evaluate the situation, and act without hesitation, which can bring invaluable skills and talent into an organization. Not only does this decision-making style lead to more efficient and streamlined organizational processes, but it also cultivates a culture of trust and confidence within the team, as employees understand that their leaders know when to take swift and decisive actions for the betterment of the organization."},{"question":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = restaurant, food = French, priceRange = moderate, near = The Six Bells.

UPDATED:. 03:38 EST, 17 January 2013. Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has infected dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination. The Health Ministry said the outbreak was first detected on January 6 and was being contained. 'Fifty-one cases have been confirmed to date,' the statement read, without mentioning fatalities. Outbreak: Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination. Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients. But recent outbreaks in nearby Haiti have killed more than 7,200 people. 'Due to the measures adopted transmission is in the phase of extinction,' it said. But in off-the-record discussions with a ministry official and doctor directly involved in fighting the outbreak, a different picture emerged with hundreds of suspected cases. They said the first cases were traced to a baseball game at the Latin American Stadium in the Cerro municipality of the Cuban capital, where fans come from all parts of the city to watch their team, the Industriales, play. 'We know what happened. Either the pork sandwiches or Tan Rico soda pop was contaminated at a game earlier this month,' the official said. 'Even some of the baseball players became sick,' she added. The Health Ministry statement said the outbreak had begun in Cerro and 'later spread to other municipalities in the capital.' Tens of thousands of British tourists Cuba every year and in particular visiting Havana, but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness. Concern: Tens of thousands of British tourists travel to Cuba every year and in particular visit Havana, but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness. Several European diplomats have told AP they are considering issuing travel advisories to citizens planning visits to Cuba, and have been concerned that the government is not sharing information with them in a timely manner. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Tourism is the top sector in Cuba's flagging Communist economy, with 2.8 million visitors a year, making £1.5billion. In 2010, 174,343 tourists from Britain visited the country. A major cholera outbreak is sure to make some visitors think twice about a trip, despite Cuba's sterling reputation in responding to epidemics and natural disasters. Community clinics and family doctors are on high alert and giving out instructions to prevent the disease, transportation hubs have passengers sterilizing their shoes before leaving town and eateries are being systematically inspected and sometimes closed, residents say. The official said Havana had been preparing to fight the disease since Cuba's first cholera outbreak in decades last year in eastern Granma province. Killer disease: Recent outbreaks in nearby Haiti have killed more than 7,200 people. There have been scattered cases since then, but all were traced to the Granma area and quickly contained, she said. 'This time is different. There are many cases, but we are well prepared in terms of supplies and the protocol,' she said, adding, 'let's just hope we can stop this before it becomes much worse.' The lack of official information until Tuesday has led to rumors that dozens have died in the Cuban capital, though the official and doctor said there had been only one fatality. The family of one man, 46-year-old Ubaldo Pino Rodriguez, told The Associated Press last week that he died of cholera in Cerro on Jan. 2, about two weeks after going to the hospital with severe vomiting. Rodriguez's sister, Yanise Pino, said her brother had a drinking problem and lived in squalid and unhygienic conditions in a tiny makeshift wooden dwelling. 'When he began to feel bad he thought it was from drinking and nothing else,' she said, adding that he left the hospital of his own accord last month. She said that following his death authorities sealed off Ubaldo's room and told her to burn all his belongings. Three Havana hospitals have been designated to handle cholera cases - one for adults, another for children and a third for pregnant women. Another doctor working at the designated adult hospital, the Center for Tropical Medicine, said they were swamped at the weekend with suspected cases. Cholera is generally not fatal, but can kill in just a few hours when diarrhea and vomiting cause dehydration, especially among the elderly. The illness runs its course within a week, making it relatively easy to track, but at the same time is highly contagious, spreading from hand to mouth, through contaminated food and the water supply. 'So far there is no indication its in the water supply, but we are dumping more chlorine in the system,' the Health Ministry official said. Until 2012, there had been no cholera outbreaks reported in Cuba since well before the 1959 revolution and the creation of a national health system by the Communist government. Hundreds of Cuban doctors and nurses have worked for over a decade in Haiti which has battled a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 7,000 people since that country's 2010 earthquake. Cuba lies closer to Haiti than any other Caribbean country, with the exception of the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the crisis stricken country and has reported more than 20,000 cholera cases and 350 deaths since the Haiti epidemic began. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"This article is about a cholera outbreak in Havana, Cuba in January 2013. Cholera is a sickness caused by a bacteria called Vibrio cholerae. It can make people feel very bad with watery diarrhea and vomiting, and if they don't get help quickly, they can become very weak or even die. In this case, 51 people got sick in Havana, and authorities were trying to stop the sickness from spreading even more. They think the sickness might have started at a baseball game where people ate bad food or drank bad soda. The authorities were doing their best to handle the situation and prevent more people from getting sick."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line.

The hospitalized man is the second of two known cases this year. The 49-year-old man, who had a history of traveling to Saudi Arabia, showed symptoms of the illness three weeks ago and was admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha four days later, according to WHO officials. He was transferred to Britain by air ambulance on Sept. 11. The virus, detected with laboratory testing, was very similar to another virus that killed a 60-year-old patient from Saudi Arabia earlier this year, the health organization said in a statement Sunday. Both are coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of ailments from the common cold to SARS. The two people known to have been infected with the new virus were struck with fever, coughing and shortness of breath. The new virus is different than any previously identified in humans, the British Health Protection Agency said. Health officials are still investigating where it came from and how it is spread; similar viruses are typically passed when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. o far, there is no evidence that the two infected people passed the virus to other people they were in contact with, including healthcare workers, the British agency said. The virus does not appear to be highly contagious, since if it were, there would likely be more cases by this point, it explained. “Based on what we know about other coronaviruses, many of these contacts will already have passed the period when they could have caught the virus from the infected person,” the agency added. But a “small number” of other recent cases of severe respiratory illness in the Middle East are being investigated to check if they are linked. The WHO has yet to recommend any travel restrictions. “Given that this is a novel coronavirus, WHO is currently in the process of obtaining further information to determine the public health implications of these two confirmed cases,” it said. Saudi officials are particularly concerned about the upcoming Hajj pilgrimage that brings millions of people to Saudi Arabia, advising pilgrims to wear masks in crowded places and keep their hands clean, the Associated Press reported. The pilgrimage has been the epicenter of previous disease outbreaks. Former police chief in China gets 15-year sentence in scandal World of woe, little hope of relief, await U.N.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Please answer this question : Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","response":"Test C would see a lower concentration of reactants than Test D. According to Le Châtelier's principle, when a chemical system in equilibrium experiences a stress, the system will adjust to counteract that stress and reestablish a new equilibrium state. In Test C, a forward reaction is observed, which means the system is shifting towards the formation of products, and as a result, the concentrations of the reactants decrease as they are consumed in the forward reaction. On the other hand, in Test D, a reverse reaction is observed, indicating that the system is shifting towards the formation of reactants. In this case, the concentrations of the reactants increase as the products are converted back to the reactants. Therefore, considering the behavior of the chemical system in equilibrium when subjected to stress as described by Le Châtelier's principle, Test C would have a lower concentration of reactants than Test D, as the forward and reverse reactions show opposite trends in the concentrations of reactants and products."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin has said that the project was \\"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \\"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\\", and Harrison, \\"the low of all-time\\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \\"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special.

However, the main question is asking for differences in genomic composition between two types of organisms, which is not addressed in the given statement. In order to answer the question appropriately, it is crucial to discuss the differences between the genomic compositions of two distinct types of organisms. For instance, comparing prokaryotes (such as bacteria) and eukaryotes (such as animals and plants) could provide a valid answer to the asked question. Here, a potential response could involve describing differences in terms of size, organization, and complexity. Prokaryotic genomes are often much smaller, relatively simpler, and lack the extensive intron-exon organization seen in eukaryotic genomes. They are also circular in shape, as opposed to the linear chromosomes typically found in eukaryotic organisms. Additionally, prokaryotic genomes typically contain a single chromosome and lack the true nucleus seen in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic genomes, on the other hand, are usually larger and more complex, with mammalian genomes frequently containing a higher proportion of repetitive DNA sequences. Eukaryotes also possess introns and exons, which are noncoding and coding regions of the gene, respectively. Furthermore, eukaryotic cells possess a true nucleus where the DNA is enclosed within a nuclear membrane. The presence or absence of organelles in the cells, along with the complexity of gene regulation and organization, all contribute to the remarkable differences in the genomic composition between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, thus providing a relevant answer to the question at hand."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: What does a child learn to do in a lake?

Sentence: Queensland may have only one of the mint plants genus in the entire world. Options are: A). Yes; B). It's impossible to say; C). No;","response":"C). No The sentence \\"Queensland may have only one of the mint plants genus in the entire world\\" is not true based on the given text. Mentha diemenica, also known as the slender mint, is indeed a mint species within the genus \\"Mentha,\\" and it is native to various regions, including Queensland. However, this does not imply that it is the only mint plant from the genus \\"Mentha\\" present in Queensland or the entire world. The genus \\"Mentha\\" contains numerous mint species other than Mentha diemenica. It is a diverse genus with more than 18 species and numerous hybrid variations. While Mentha diemenica can be found in several regions throughout Australia, there may very well be other species of the \\"Mentha\\" genus present in Queensland as well. Additionally, the text does not provide any information supporting that Queensland only has one mint plant from the genus \\"Mentha\\" in the entire world. Instead, it states that Mentha diemenica is native not only to Queensland but also to Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Thus, it would be incorrect to conclude that Queensland only has one mint plant from the genus \\"Mentha\\" in the entire world, based on the provided information."},{"question":"Q:Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

A:","response":"To provide a well-reasoned answer, I will first find out the release dates of both films, Sweet Crude and My Generation. After determining the release dates, we can then compare them to see which film premiered more recently. Sweet Crude is a documentary film directed by Sandy Cioffi. It is about the Niger Delta region in Nigeria and the issues surrounding its oil-rich resources. The documentary premiered in April 2009 at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival. My Generation is a documentary film directed by David Batty and narrated by Michael Caine. It showcases the cultural revolution in London during the 1960s and features interviews with prominent figures of the era. My Generation premiered at the 2017 Venice Film Festival. Now that we have the release dates of both films, we can compare them. Sweet Crude premiered in 2009, whereas My Generation premiered in 2017. Since 2017 is more recent than 2009, we can conclude that My Generation premiered more recently than Sweet Crude."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Answer:","response":"Both Porcelaine and Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore are scenthounds that share some similarities with the Foxhound breed, mainly in their strong sense of smell and hunting abilities. However, their genetic makeup and histories are different. Porcelaine is an ancient scenthound breed that originated in France. It is believed to be the oldest French scent hound, dating back to the 14th century. While the breed's exact origin is uncertain, it is thought to have descended from ancient Greek hounds brought to France by Roman soldiers. Porcelain dogs were bred primarily for hunting small game such as hare and roe deer. Although their exact genetic lineage is unclear and may have been influenced by various other hounds over time, there isn't any strong evidence pointing towards a direct cross with Foxhounds. On the other hand, Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore is a direct result of crossing French scent hounds with English Foxhounds. This breed was developed in France during the 19th century to meet the increasing demand for powerful hunting dogs suited for hunting large game such as deer, boar, and wolves. A cross between smaller French scent hounds and the larger English Foxhounds provided both the needed size and agility, as well as the highly developed sense of smell required for their hunting pursuits. In summary, while the Porcelaine breed might share some characteristics with Foxhounds, it is not a direct result of crossing with them. On the contrary, the Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore was intentionally developed by crossing French scent hounds, including the ancestors of the Porcelaine breed, with English Foxhounds to create a new, powerful scenthound."},{"question":"Ask a question about Chihuahua (state).","response":"What are some historical, cultural, and geographical features of Chihuahua, the largest state in Mexico?"},{"question":"Q:What's the answer to that question: who's kobe bryant?

Each individual ant hardly weigh anything, but put together they weigh roughly the same as all of mankind. They also live nearly everywhere, except on frozen mountain tops and around the poles.Foranimals their size, ants have been astonishingly successful, largely due to their wonderfulsocial behavior. In colonies that range in size from a few hundred to tens of millions, they organize their lives with a clear division of labor. Even more amazing is how they achievethis level of organization. Where we use sound and sight to communicate, ants dependprimarily on pheromone , chemicals sent out by individuals and smelled or tastedby fellow members of their colony. When an ant finds food, it produces a pheromone that will lead others straight to where the food is. When an individual ant comes under attack or is dying, it sends out an alarm pheromone to warn the colony to prepare for a conflict as a defense unit. In fact, when it comes to the art of war, ants have no equal. They are completely fearless and will readily take on a creature much larger than themselves, attacking in large groups and overcoming their target. Such is their devotion to the common good of the colony that not only soldier ants but also worker ants will sacrifice their lives to help defeat an enemy. Behaving in this selfless and devoted manner, these little creatures have survived on Earth, for more than 140 million years, far longer than dinosaurs.

So, Betty shared the story about Timmy the Turtle. You see, Timmy the Turtle accidentally swallowed a plastic bag while swimming in the ocean and got very sick. The poor turtle thought the plastic bag was a delicious jellyfish, but it wasn't food at all. She also told Jessica about Libby the Little Bird, who was living on the beach where her mommy and daddy used to find food for her. But now, there was so much plastic garbage on the beach that Libby's parents had trouble finding real food for her, and sometimes they brought small plastic pieces to her by mistake. This made Libby very sad and hungry. Jessica understood that plastics could be very harmful to their animal friends, so she wanted to learn more about how to reduce plastic use in her life. Betty was excited to teach her friend about how to make the change. She started by showing Jessica her new reusable water bottle. This shiny bottle could be filled with water over and over again, which meant no more plastic water bottles would be thrown away. Next, she showed her some reusable shopping bags – they were made from cloth and could be folded up small to fit in a pocket or purse. When it was time for shopping, they could be used again and again. Betty also told Jessica about thinking carefully when buying stuff like toys or games. Instead of getting the ones wrapped in lots and lots of plastic, she and her mom tried to find ones with less packaging and made from environmentally friendly materials. Jessica thought this was a great idea, and she became inspired to try and reduce her own plastic use. From that day on, Betty and Jessica worked together to share their knowledge with their families and friends. They even talked to their teacher about organizing a school clean-up day to help pick up litter around the playground and the school.

Noting this temperature the reaction takes almost 4 times as long which is completely unacceptable, He then gets an idea to add and enzyme designed specifically for these two chemicals and then tries the reaction at the modest 65 degrees Celsius again calling this one trial C Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given that this enzyme is designed specifically for use with the chemicals in this experiment, will the reaction for trial C be faster or slower than the reaction in trial B? Hint: Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below . Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme is highly specific for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective. A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form.","response":"Given that enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed and the enzyme in this case is designed specifically for the chemicals in this experiment, the reaction for trial C at 65 degrees Celsius with the enzyme will be faster than the reaction in trial B at the same temperature without the enzyme. This is because the enzyme will help speed up the reaction and make it more efficient, even at the modest temperature of 65 degrees Celsius."},{"question":"Multi-choice question: What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice by the narrowest margin in more than a century. Later that day, Republican lawmakers celebrated raucously — on “Saturday Night Live,” at least. “We could tell that people really wanted Kavanaugh,” Beck Bennett’s Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told CNN anchor Dana Bash, played by Heidi Gardner. “Everyone is pumped, from white men over 60 to white men over 70.\\" Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It” blared in the background as Bash turned to other conservative members of the Senate, such as Cecily Strong’s Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). After Kate McKinnon’s Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) praised Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) for having “scored in his own goal,” Collins addressed her own decision to vote in favor of Kavanaugh. “The last thing I wanted was to make this about me — that’s why I told everyone to tune in at 3 p.m. so I could tell all my female supporters, ‘Psych!' \\" she said, referring to the real-life Collins’s lengthy Senate floor speech on Friday that caused the crash of a website that was set up to fund her future opponent, probably due to an influx of support. \\"Listen, I think it’s important to believe women until it’s time to stop.” \\"We couldn't have done it without Susan Collins.\\" — Sen. Lindsey Graham #SNL pic.twitter.com/m1hfjgoWI4 — Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) October 7, 2018 The fictional celebration, during which Gardner’s Bash observed that many pacemakers were “put to the test,” continued with Pete Davidson’s Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who was considered a swing vote alongside Collins, Manchin and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the last of whom voted against Kavanaugh. “Obviously, I was really sad about the whole process,” Flake said before Graham smashed a pie in his face and exclaimed, “Seriously, this one is about the fans. They’ve been there for us all week, cheering and screaming outside of our offices. . . . I know they agree with us because they’re shouting out Me Too.” After Aidy Bryant’s prosecutor Rachel Mitchell made a brief return to say that she hopes she made women proud, the network switched from the jubilant Republican senators to the “losing team,” represented by Alex Moffat’s Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “The Dems lost another one,” he said. “We thought this time would be better than the Anita Hill hearing because Dr. Ford was white, but turned out Brett Kavanaugh was white, too.” The cold open drew to a close as Republicans sprayed Miller High Life, the “champagne of beers,” all over and Graham called Kavanaugh the “Natty Light of judges,\\" adding that he hoped we, as a country, “keep this horny male energy going 'til the midterms!” Read more: Matt Damon plays a fiery Brett Kavanaugh in the SNL premiere’s cold open Kanye West praised Trump in a meandering speech on SNL.

Saturday Night Live via YouTube As CNN's Dana Bash (Heidi Gardner) reported from the locker room celebration, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett) proclaims, \\"Republicans read the mood of the country and we could tell that people really wanted Kavanaugh. Everyone's pumped — from white men over 60 to white men over 70.\\" Kate McKinnon was back as Sen. Lindsey Graham: \\"We made a lot of women real worried today, but I'm not getting pregnant so I don't care!\\" Cecily Strong took on Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who had reportedly been undecided on Kavanaugh's nomination, though offered a lengthy defense of him in a speech Friday. \\"The last thing I wanted was to make this about me,\\" Strong's Collins says. \\"That's why I told everyone to tune in at 3 p.m. So I could tell all my female supporters: Psych!\\" \\"Listen, I think it's important to believe women, until it's time to stop,\\" she adds. Later in the scene, McKinnon's Graham alluded to the protesters that have gathered in Washington, D.C. in the past few days to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination. \\"This one is about the fans. They've been there for us all week, cheering and screaming outside of our offices,\\" he says. \\" ... And I know that they agree with us because they're shouting out, 'Me too.' \\" Later in the show, a brief prerecorded scene wondered what would happen if the \\"presidential alert\\" that millions of Americans received Wednesday were to resemble the president's tweets: \\"Puerto Rico is fine now! I guess the paper towels worked!\\" Another: \\"Warning: White men are under attack.\\" Saturday Night Live via YouTube Another recorded video waded into the Texas senate race between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke. While supporters chalk up progressive challenger Beto O'Rourke's \\"cool\\" factor — like when a video circulated on social media of the Texas congressman skateboarding in a parking lot, or when Texas Republicans mocked his earlier years as a punk musician — SNL imagined a Ted Cruz rally's attempt at \\"cool.\\" \\"Maybe Ted Cruz can't sound cool, but I bet we can make him look cool!\\" says this week's host Awkwafina, in character as a \\"hype woman.\\" Saturday Night Live via YouTube On Weekend Update, the Trump brothers were back again, with Alex Moffat and Mikey Day reprising their frequent roles as Eric and Donald Jr. Saturday Night Live via YouTube Last week, Kanye West made headlines for, among other things (like wearing a Perrier costume), making a speech after the show had gone off the air in support of President Trump. West wore a \\"Make America Great Again\\" hat and said, \\"They bullied me backstage, they said don't go out there with that hat on.\\" Cast member Pete Davidson took to the Weekend Update desk this week and said that wasn't true.

Here's how I as an AI would analyze this task: Step 1: Identifying the Core Ideas In this case, the premise: \\"well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see\\"; and the hypothesis: \\"The nursing home is paid for by Social Security\\", share two core ideas: the nursing home and Social Security. Step 2: Analyzing the Connection between the ideas In both the premise and the hypothesis, Social Security has a relationship with the nursing home. Step 3: Defining Key Terms \\"Covered by\\" in this context suggests a type of financial support provided by Social Security for the nursing home. Similarly, \\"paid for by\\" indicates the source of funds for the nursing home is Social Security. Step 4: Evaluating the Statements \\"Covered by\\" could infer a variety of possible financial arrangements, including total or partial funding. \\"Paid for by\\" suggests that Social Security is the source of full payment for the nursing home Step 5: Conclusion Since the premise does not specify the extent to which Social Security is involved in the financial coverage, it is not certain to say that the hypothesis -\\"The nursing home is paid for by Social Security\\" - is completely accurate, as it implies full financial support. We only know from the premise that there is some level of support from Social Security, not necessarily that it takes care of the entirety of the cost. However, there is a partial match between the two because both indicate some financial tie between Social Security and the nursing home. In essence, the hypothesis could be true, but based on the given premise alone, we cannot conclusively affirm it. We need more specific information about the extent of coverage Social Security provides to the nursing home."},{"question":"Mercedes-Benz unveils rugged 2013 G-Class SUV Mercedes-Benz has again reshaped its G-Class, the closest vehicle left to the giant, gas-guzzling, Hummeresque SUVs of the 1990s. Thinking of invading a third-world country? You'll want to show up in a G-Class to take the reins of power. But hold off the tanks until August, when it comes to showrooms. Perhaps the biggest change is under the hood: the 2013 G63 AMG will come with an eight-cylinder bi-turbo engine. For fuel economy, as if that matters, there will be a stop-start feature to turn off the engine at stoplights. For the redo, Mercedes has loaded up its premier luxury off-road vehicle with lots of technology. The instrument cluster and center console have been completely redesigned and Mercedes' new, fancy infotainment system has been added. Now, safety features like blind-spot detection, a parking aid and adaptive cruise control have been added. When it began in 1979, the G-Class had a sparse interior to go with its rugged, off-roading spirit. It has since been gentrified: \\"Our G-Class has been a force to be reckoned with for the last 33 years. In its latest evolutionary stage, it offers state-of-the­-art, powerful engines, a further improved range of luxurious appointments and the very latest safety features, as well, of course, as its now legendary off-road capabilities. At the same time the design remains true to its down-to-earth, unmistakable style,\\" says Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Mercedes parent Daimler, in a statement.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Lives of Others Movie plot: The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. The film opens in East Berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the Stasi, or secret police. Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), code name HGW XX/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. Wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. A student asks a question that Wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \\"bourgeois\\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. During the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck draws a portrait of Wiesler that borders on caricature: Wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the Stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. He is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \\"the System,\\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better Socialist society.At the end of the class, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the Culture Department at Stasi, comes to invite Wiesler to a theatrical premiere. The play is by the celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and its leading character is played by Dreyman's lover, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress of great reputation. Dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush East Berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among DDR officials who value him because he's one of the few East German writers whose work is read in the west. He preserves the respect of the artistic community by using his (relatively) secure position for occasional interventions in favor of dissident fellow artists....

Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

For the lemon zest, grate only the outer yellow skin. Avoid using the inner white skin as it will have a bitter taste. The lemon zest will brighten up all the flavors in the muffins.;","response":"To create lemon zest, you should choose option ii: For the lemon zest, grate only the outer yellow skin. Avoid using the inner white skin as it will have a bitter taste. The lemon zest will brighten up all the flavors in the muffins. Here is a detailed explanation of how to do this: 1. Choose the right lemon: Look for a lemon with a bright yellow, unwaxed skin. A smooth and thin skin is preferable as it is easier to grate. Make sure the lemon is fresh and doesn't have any soft spots or blemishes. 2. Clean the lemon: Before zesting your lemon, rinse it under cold water and use a vegetable brush to gently scrub the skin. This will help remove any dirt or residue. Dry the lemon with a clean kitchen towel. 3. Choose the right tool: There are several tools you can use to create lemon zest, such as a zester, a grater, or a microplane. A zester works best for long, thin strips of zest, while a fine grater or microplane works best for small pieces of zest. Choose the tool that will give you the desired size and texture of zest for your recipe. 4. Zesting technique: Hold the lemon securely in one hand and the chosen tool in the other hand. Apply gentle pressure and move the tool back and forth over the outer yellow skin of the lemon. Be careful not to press too hard, as this will cause the tool to grate the inner white pith, which is bitter. Rotate the lemon as you zest, so you're only removing the outer yellow skin. The goal is to remove only the flavorful yellow part of the lemon and avoid the white pith. 5. Collect your zest: As you're zesting, the lemon zest will collect on the surface of the tool or on the cutting board beneath it. Carefully transfer the zest to a small plate or bowl. If necessary, use a knife or your fingers to dislodge any stubborn pieces of zest from the tool. 6. Measure and add to the recipe: Use a teaspoon or another measuring tool to collect the required amount of lemon zest for your recipe. Be sure to pack the zest lightly when measuring, as overpacking may result in too much zest and an overpowering flavor. 7. Store leftover zest: If you have any leftover lemon zest, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze it for longer storage. Use the leftover zest to add a fresh burst of lemon flavor to other recipes, such as baked goods, sauces, or salad dressings. By following these steps and choosing option ii, you'll successfully create lemon zest that will enhance the flavors in your muffins or other dishes without adding any unwanted bitterness."},{"question":"Complete: he glanced down at a photo of a bright , sunny day , the park aglow with the faces of happy children . no hint of poverty or disillusionment in sight . \`\` amazing how different the park looks through your eyes .

The violence in the city lasted from 9 October 1740 until 22 October, with minor skirmishes outside the walls continuing late into November that year. Historians have estimated that at least 10,000 ethnic Chinese were massacred; just 600 to 3,000 are believed to have survived. In September 1740, as unrest rose among the Chinese population, spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force. On 7 October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar River and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22 October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area. The following year, attacks on ethnic Chinese throughout Java sparked the two-year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops. Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands and charged with crimes related to the massacre.

Question 2: How can I get a tourist visa for the USA if my spouse is going there on a business trip and I need to accompany him? What is the most economical way to book my travel? To get a tourist visa for the USA and accompany your spouse, you will typically need to apply for a non-immigrant B-2 visa. These visas are designed for individuals traveling to the United States for tourism, medical treatment, family visits, and other temporary non-business purposes. Here's a step-by-step guide on obtaining your tourist visa and planning an economical trip: 1. Determine eligibility: Ensure that you fulfill the eligibility requirements for a B-2 visa. In general, applicants need to demonstrate that they have strong ties to their home country, sufficient financial resources to support themselves during the trip, and a clear intention to return after their temporary stay. 2. Complete the DS-160 form: Fill out the DS-160 online non-immigrant visa application form. Carefully provide all required information, including personal details, travel plans, and information about your spouse's business trip. 3. Pay the visa fee: The B-2 visa application requires a fee. Follow the instructions provided on your local U.S. consulate or embassy's website to pay the required amount. 4. Schedule an appointment: To complete the visa application process, you'll need to schedule an appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate in your country of residence. Appointment scheduling is generally done through the embassy or consulate's website or designated call center. 5. Attend the interview: Prepare all required documents, including passport, DS-160 confirmation page, appointment confirmation letter, a photograph, proof of financial resources, and any relevant information regarding your spouse's business trip. During your visa interview, you will be asked questions about your travel plans, financial resources, and ties to your home country. 6. Await the visa decision: Following the interview, the U.S. embassy or consulate will review your application and make a decision regarding your visa. If approved, your passport will be stamped with the B-2 visa, allowing you to travel to the USA. To book an economical trip, consider the following tips: 1. Start early: Begin your travel planning as soon as possible to take advantage of early bird discounts and lower flight fares. 2. Be flexible: Be open to traveling during off-peak hours and adjusting your travel dates to benefit from lower prices. 3. Compare ticket prices: Use various travel websites and booking platforms to compare flight fares and find the most cost-effective options. 4. Bundle your bookings: Booking your flight, accommodation, and transportation together can often result in lower prices. 5.

Don't worry, the cleaning process is quick, so your fish will be fine. Do not remove your fish, decorations, or plants from the tank. There are two tools aquarium hobbyists will use for cleaning their gravel. Aquarium siphons usually have a thick, plastic tube or \\"siphon\\" with a thin, flexible, tube attached to one end. Some of these may have a priming ball attached to one end. Plastic, flexible tubes can also be used to clean gravel. These are ideal for smaller tanks. The bucket must be beneath the water level. It will catch the old water. Slowly lower the entire siphon into the tank so that all of the air gets out of the tube. Cover the end of the tube with your thumb and take it out of the tank; keep the other, open, end submerged. Place the covered end in a bucket. If you release your thumb, the water will begin to flow; if you cover the end again with your thumb, the water will stop. Some aquarium vacuums come with a rubber ball attached to the end of the siphon. Stick the end of the siphon into the aquarium and lower the end of the tube into a bucket. Plug the end of the tube with your finger, and squeeze on the priming ball. Slowly let go of the ball, but keep the end of the tube plugged. Water will begin to fill the siphon, sort of like an eyedropper or turkey baster. When you unplug the end of the tube, water will start to flow into the bucket. These types of gravel vacuums are different from all others. They do not require a bucket. Instead, they need to be hooked up to a water faucet. Simply plug the end of the Python vacuum to your water faucet and place the entire vacuum into the aquarium. When you turn the faucet on, the vacuum will begin to siphon.

It emphasizes the importance of unplugging the heater and turning off the filter and pump before beginning the cleaning process, and describes how to properly use each type of tool to safely clean the gravel without removing fish, decorations, or plants from the tank."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: When did Nine Inch Nails return to touring after its lead singer decided to cease touring with the band?, using the article: Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor. Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed touring in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The answer to your friend's question is that Nine Inch Nails returned to touring in 2013 after its lead singer, Trent Reznor, decided to cease touring with the band in 2008.

I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The law will help reduce abortions as well support abortions under certain circumstances once brought up to court.","response":"Based on the initial paragraph provided, it cannot be concluded that the sentence \\"The law will help reduce abortions as well as support abortions under certain circumstances once brought up to court\\" is entirely true. The paragraph appears to express a strong belief in the promotion of a culture of life and the protection of every child. However, it does not explicitly mention any support for allowing abortions under certain circumstances. Nonetheless, the paragraph acknowledges that there are great differences in opinions regarding abortion and encourages people to find common ground. Therefore, it leaves room for the possibility of a compromise on the issue, where abortions might be allowed under specific conditions or circumstances. It is important to consider that political, social, cultural, and ethical dynamics can influence the way laws are enacted and enforced. Laws in different jurisdictions may support or limit access to abortion, depending on existing legal frameworks and ongoing public debate. In a society where the promotion of a culture of life is highly valued, laws to regulate abortion might focus on reducing the overall number of cases while still permitting the procedure under certain circumstances. For example, some countries permit abortions in cases of rape, incest, or severe fetal abnormalities. One possible interpretation of the paragraph could be that \\"reasonable people\\" from opposing sides of the abortion debate may work together to find a balance between supporting life and protecting a woman's autonomy. This might ultimately lead to the creation of laws that help reduce abortions overall while still accommodating certain cases that require more nuanced consideration. To conclude, it is not accurate to say that the provided sentence directly reflects the ideas expressed in the initial paragraph. However, given the acknowledgment of differing opinions and the call for reasonable people to \\"put a good law in place,\\" it is possible to infer that a compromise involving legal provisions to support abortions under certain circumstances might be reached in the attempt to reduce the overall number of abortions."},{"question":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: glee","response":"Question: What is the term used to describe a feeling of great pleasure, happiness, or delight?

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping. Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the ransom. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby. He dies before he can reveal Sean's location. Shaker later arranges another drop off.

Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration.

Article: One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the Rock & Roll music popular around the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was a teenager, Elvis moved from Tupelos to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school, but he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called \\"country and western\\". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. There was something different about it. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music, which black people used to sing in the American South, music known as \\"blues\\". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis rose to fame all over the country. Later, Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films like Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it hard to live with success, like many other entertainment personalities .He began to take drugs and his health began to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977, his many millions of fans were shocked. \\"The King Is Dead!\\" the newspaper said.

Fact1: cow town of Spurline is ruled by Virgil Renchler, Fact2: newly elected sheriff of Spurline contend with Renchler 's henchmen and fierce opposition of townspeople, Fact3: Spurline be ruined without Golden Empire 's business, Fact4: Huneker law that hit Martin with car, Fact5: Renchler what remembers from night of Martin 's death","response":"In the rustic and remote cow town of Spurline, life had become quite challenging for the inhabitants, especially when the overlord Virgil Renchler took over. Known for his domination and tyranny, Renchler had managed to grip the town in his ceaseless clutches. However, from time to time, some brave souls would challenge his rule and attempt to break free from his yoke. Among all the industries and businesses prevailing in the town, the Golden Empire held the firmest grip over the town’s economy. Many local businesses and inhabitants depended on the Golden Empire for their sustenance, making it almost impossible for them to resist Renchler's control. As a result, any disruption of the Golden Empire's operations would have a catastrophic effect on Spurline. The winds of change swept through Spurline, as a newly-elected and valiant sheriff, John Conyers, took office. Known for his disapproval of Renchler's influence over the town, Sheriff Conyers started taking steps to curb Renchler's authority. Much to Sheriff Conyers' dismay, he found himself in a battle with two different fronts - Renchler's henchmen and the fears and opposition from the townspeople. The latter group's resistance was linked to their dependency on the Golden Empire and their fear of losing their livelihoods. Renchler, however, did not sit idly and watch his power being challenged. He deployed his henchmen to do everything in their capacity to repel the sheriff's advances. Tensions soared, and events took a dark turn when an incident involving a new law, known as the \\"Huneker Law,\\" unfolded. The law aimed to cover up an atrocious incident, wherein the car of one of Renchler’s henchmen hit a local man named Martin, causing his death. Renchler's henchmen sought to make the issue go away by crafting the Huneker Law. This law was cleverly designed to obfuscate the true cause of Martin's death and protect the perpetrators. The sheriff, on the other hand, was determined to unveil the truth and hold the responsible parties accountable. Despite the suffocating pressure from Renchler's henchmen, Sheriff Conyers continued his investigation and finally managed to uncover evidence against Renchler’s henchman who had caused Martin's death. It seemed that Renchler, shaken by the pressure of the investigation and the graveness of Martin’s demise, had finally let his guard down. When confronted, it was clear that Renchler was haunted by the memories of Martin's death. Reflecting on the past events, Renchler had no choice but to yield to the truth. With his empire and reputation threatened, he was forced to make dramatic changes in his approach to the town and its people. Rattled by the news of the investigation's outcome and more exposed than he had ever been, Renchler started to lose his grasp on Spurline. A feeling of renewed hope surfaced among the townspeople, as they no longer feared losing their opportunities and supports in the face of Golden Empire’s business, even with Sheriff Conyers’ efforts to change the balance of power in the town. In this compelling tale of power, corruption, and the quest for justice, Spurline slowly began to emerge from the oppressive shadows of Virgil Renchler's rule. As the townspeople discovered their voices, the once resigned residents found strength in unity, daring to stand against the dark forces that had long dictated their daily lives. And with Sheriff Conyers relentlessly seeking justice for innocent victims like Martin, a new era of hope began to dawn over the quiet cow town of Spurline."},{"question":"Add spaces: ThisiscomplementedbyanambitiousstrategyforCorporateSocialResponsibilitytogenerateahigherleveloftrustandconsumerconfidenceandimprovecompanies'contributiontosociety'swell-being.","response":"This is complemented by an ambitious strategy for Corporate Social Responsibility to generate a higher level of trust and consumer confidence and improve companies' contribution to society's well-being. The statement above highlights the importance of integrating a well-rounded Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach into an organization's overall business strategy. By doing so, companies can foster trust and consumer confidence while simultaneously enhancing their positive impact on society as a whole. A comprehensive CSR plan usually involves several key components, which are detailed below: 1. Ethical Business Practices: Companies are expected to operate with a high level of integrity and adhere to all laws and regulations that govern their industries. This involves ensuring fair labor practices, honoring contractual obligations, and refraining from engaging in corrupt or deceptive activities. 2. Environmental Sustainability: Companies can contribute to the well-being of the planet by minimizing their carbon footprint, conserving natural resources, and implementing eco-friendly solutions within their daily operations. This could encompass responsible waste management, utilizing green energy sources, and engaging in sustainable supply chain practices. 3. Social Impact: Companies should commit to making a positive impact on the communities in which they operate by doing things such as supporting local initiatives, promoting charitable giving, and collaborating with non-profit organizations to provide social and educational programs for underprivileged populations. 4. Employee Well-being and Development: Prioritizing employee welfare is critical for companies that wish to be socially responsible. This might include providing fair wages and benefits, ensuring a safe and inclusive work environment, and offering professional development opportunities that enable employees to enhance their skills and grow within the organization. 5.

However, the customer is clearly disappointed with the sound quality, which he describes as \\"mediocre,\\" \\"muddy,\\" and lacking definition in the high end. The bass is also criticized for being indistinct and fuzzy. In comparing the headphones to a higher-end product (Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series), the customer finds the difference in quality to be dramatic, and expresses disappointment with the JBL headphones' claim to be a \\"reference\\" product. The review also states that they will only be used at the gym and not anywhere else, suggesting limited satisfaction with the product. The customer concludes the review by suggesting that those seeking good or decent sound quality should look elsewhere, but if one is only looking for something better than earbuds for an MP3 player, then the headphones in question might suffice. From this analysis, it is evident that the customer is generally dissatisfied with the product due to its poor sound quality, despite some positive features."},{"question":"Given the question: Title: Really Fun Product review: We had sooo much fun with this toy.My kids laughed so hard I couldn't believe.
