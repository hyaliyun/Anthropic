Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the product they purchased based on their expectations. Their disappointment primarily stems from not being aware of the different types of remastering available for the original recording. They ended up with the version that has only 2 parts instead of 4, which they believe does not justify the amount they paid for it. Several factors contribute to the negative tone of the review: 1. Confusion: The reviewer did not realize the distinctions between the available types of remastering, implying that this information was not well-communicated or well-understood. 2. Disappointment: The reviewer's expectations were not met because the version they acquired only contained 2 parts instead of the 4 they expected. 3. Financial dissatisfaction: The reviewer feels that the money they spent on the product was not justified, considering the incomplete nature of the remastered version they acquired. 4. Implicit comparison: The mention of two different types of remastering may indicate that the reviewer believes the other version with 4 parts would have been worth the money, amplifying the negative tone.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"Step 1: Understanding the context The statement says, \\"Cowboy at a rodeo hurls his lasso at a young bull.\\" This gives us information that there is a cowboy participating in an event at a rodeo, and he is attempting to catch or control a young bull using a lasso. Step 2: Understanding the use of a lasso in rodeo A lasso is a long rope with a loop at one end, mainly used by cowboys in rodeos. It is designed to be thrown around a target, like a bull or a calf, and then tightened. The purpose is to catch the animal, generally by entangling its legs or head, and control it without causing serious harm. Step 3: Analyzing if the cowboy is hurting the bull Using a lasso to catch and control animals at a rodeo is typical, and the cowboys are trained professionals who know how to use the lasso without hurting animals. While there is a possibility of causing discomfort, the primary goal of using the lasso in such events is not to intentionally inflict harm. Step 4: Final answer Based on the information provided and the context of a rodeo event, the answer is: - it is not possible to tell Although using a lasso at a rodeo is generally intended not to cause harm, we cannot decisively determine whether the cowboy is hurting the young bull or not without more information or direct observation of the event."},{"question":"Text: Scallops are characterized by offering two flavors and textures in one shell: the meat, called \`\`scallop'', which is firm and white, and the roe, called \`\`coral'', which is soft and often brightly coloured reddish-orange.

If you prefer, though, you can use any type of soft but supportive cushion that helps you stay in the upright seated posture used for traditional Zen meditation. For extra comfort, place a meditation mat, or even a blanket or towel, on the floor underneath the cushion. Sit in the center of the cushion if you prefer keeping your knees on it. Especially if you’re new to Zen meditation, you may find it easier to sit with your crossed legs resting on the cushion along with your backside. Sit at the front of the cushion if you want to rest your knees on the floor. This is a more traditional approach—your backside on the zafu and your crossed legs draped over the front. The lotus position is the most traditional way to cross your legs during Zen meditation, but it may not be comfortable for newcomers or those with physical limitations. Fortunately, there are several positions you can use. Popular choices include: Lotus: Cross your left leg over your right so that the tops of both of your feet are resting on the upper thigh of the opposite leg. Half Lotus: Cross your left leg over your right and rest your left foot on your right upper thigh, but tuck your right foot beneath your left leg. You can reverse legs if desired. Quarter Lotus: Cross your legs loosely so that your left knee is resting on (or just slightly above, depending on your flexibility) the side of your right foot, and vice versa. Burmese: Instead of crossing one leg over the other, spread your legs a bit wider, rest your knees, lower legs, and feet on the mat (or floor), and touch the heel of one foot to the base of the ankle of the other foot. Don’t choose a soft, cushiony chair that you can sink down into, but rather one that enables you to sit flat-footed and fully upright. A wooden dining chair or even a folding metal chair may work—just make sure you can sit to the front of the chair and reach your feet flat to the ground. Sit far enough forward that, when sitting fully upright, no part of your body can contact the back of the chair. You could use a chair-height stool if desired, because you shouldn’t be in contact with the back of the chair anyway. Your lower legs, from your feet to your knees, should create 2 parallel vertical columns that are perpendicular to the floor. Your knees should bend at 90-degree angles, so that your upper legs are parallel to the floor. Your knees and feet should be at the same width apart as your hips, and your toes should be pointed straight forward. Find a higher or lower chair if necessary so you can achieve this position. Add a lumbar support behind your lower back if necessary. You may not be able to sit fully upright on the front section of the chair without experiencing lower back discomfort. In this case, wedge a rounded lumbar pillow between your lower back and the base of the chair back. Roll up your meditation cushion into a log shape. Your goal is to create a tubular cushion from your zafu that you can straddle with your legs, knees on the floor and backside resting on the cushion. If your zafu isn't big enough on its own, use additional cushions, mats, and/or blankets to build up the height needed to support this position. Lay one or multiple mats on the floor. Your knees will be supporting a fair amount of your body weight, so it’s helpful to give them some cushioning. Place at least one meditation mat or soft blanket on the floor, and use more than one if needed to provide additional cushioning. The rolled cushion needs to be sturdy enough so that you can keep your upper body straight, rather than slouching down into the cushion. Imagine that you are sitting on a bicycle or a horse. Your lower legs and knees should be flat on the floor and against the sides of the cushion, your upper legs should be at roughly 45-degree angles, and your upper body should be perpendicular to the ground. Your shoulders, hips, and the middle of your shins should all be in a vertical line. Meditation benches typically have 2 legs and a forward-slanted seat. Straddle the seat in the same way you would a rolled-up cushion, with your upper body upright and your lower legs flat on the floor. Some meditation benches are wide enough that you can tuck your lower legs between the bench legs, rather than straddling them to the outside. What is a summary?","response":"A summary of the article would be: When practicing Zen meditation, it's essential to maintain a proper upright seated posture for maximum comfort and effectiveness. Traditionalists often use a circular meditation cushion called a zafu, but any supportive cushion can be used. A meditation mat, blanket, or towel can be placed underneath for extra comfort. Different leg positions such as the Lotus, Half Lotus, Quarter Lotus, and Burmese can be used depending on personal comfort and flexibility. A supportive chair or meditation bench can also be suitable alternatives. Lumbar support may be helpful for those experiencing lower back discomfort while sitting upright on a chair. Rolled cushion or meditation bench with proper leg placement can provide an effective posture for Zen meditation.

Step 2: Enumerate common issues for smartphone apps In order to generate a 1-star review, I can look for common pain points users have with apps, such as crashes, poor user interface, lack of useful features, and poor customer support. Step 3: Create a fictional user scenario with the app For the review, I'll imagine a user who is trying to use the app to communicate with their friends or share files but is facing several of the issues mentioned above. Step 4: Write the review Here's the final 1-star review for com.oakley.fon app: Title: Horrendously Disappointing! Review: I had high hopes for the com.oakley.fon app, but I'm utterly disappointed. Not only did I encounter multiple crashes and freezing issues, but the user interface is clunky and confusing. I struggled to navigate through the app and couldn't figure out where anything was located. Half of the time, I couldn't even send messages or share files with my friends. To make matters worse, when I contacted their customer support, they didn't respond for days, and when they did, they were of no help! They didn't seem to understand their own app or how to fix the issues I was facing. There are so many better options out there, and I won't waste any more time using this frustrating and unreliable app. I absolutely do not recommend it."},{"question":"QPR striker Loic Remy arrested on suspicion of rape - Premier League News Updated May 15, 2013 2:16 PM ET Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy has been arrested on suspicion of rape, sources have said.

If you purchase a Purebred Cavalier, you can expect them to be energetic, lovable house pets with fairly manageable coats. Genetically speaking, Cavaliers have a happy-go-lucky predisposition. If you purchase a Purebred, you can expect such a temperament. Non-Purebred Cavaliers may adopt some of the biological traits of whatever other breed they are mixed with. If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place. People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues. Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic. Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain.

Acevedo was born in 1924 in California to Mexican parents who were deported 13 years later; he and his siblings went to Mexico, too, and he re-entered the US at age 17 to join the Army. In October 1944, Acevedo found himself a medic in Europe. Just a few months later, at the Battle of the Bulge, he was captured, and began a journal that would end up being hugely significant, one that's coming back into view in the wake of Acevedo's Feb. 11 death at age 93. Acevedo was one of 350 \\"undesirables,\\" US soldiers that included Jews and were sent to the slave labor camp at Buchenwald known as Berga in February 1945, reports CNN. Half the soldiers sent there didn't make it out alive, and Acevedo journaled every US death he observed, as well as horrors experienced there, including his own: being made to fill the bullet holes left in the heads of dead soldiers with wax to mask the shootings. He told CNN in 2008 that dandelion leaves were a \\"gourmet meal\\" compared to their normal rations: soup cooked from rats and cats, and bread made from sawdust, ground glass, and barley. The Press-Enterprise reports he weighed just 87 pounds by April 1945. CNN notes that the US didn't recognize the ordeal of the soldiers kept at Berga until Acevedo went public with his story in 2008. Acevedo donated his diary, which he concealed in his pants and wrote using ink mixed with urine or snow, to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2010. (The museum just took a stand against Aung San Suu Kyi.)","response":"Title: The Courageous Journey of Anthony Acevedo: From Deportation to Defending his Homeland Introduction The story of Anthony Acevedo, a World War II veteran, and medic who chronicled his experiences in a German slave labor camp, is not only a testament to resilience and unyielding determination, but also a stark reminder of the horrors of war. After being deported to Mexico with his family despite being born in the United States, Acevedo defied all odds and returned to his homeland, joining the US Army at the age of 17. His compelling tale sheds light on the underappreciated ordeals of hundreds of 'undesirable' American soldiers held in captivity during the Second World War. Anthony Acevedo: From Deportation to Joining the Army Anthony Acevedo was born in 1924 in California to Mexican parents who were deported 13 years later during the Mexican Repatriation, a mass expulsion of Mexican-Americans from the United States. Despite being born in the US, Acevedo decided to follow his parents to Mexico. However, after the Pearl Harbor attack, Acevedo was determined to defend his homeland, which meant returning to it. At age 17, he re-entered the US and joined the Army. The Battle of the Bulge and Capture In October 1944, Acevedo found himself in the midst of World War II as a medic stationed in Europe. Just a few months later, during the Battle of the Bulge, Acevedo was captured by German forces. A Journal of Horrors and the Buchenwald Slave Labor Camp Acevedo was one of 350 “undesirables”, US soldiers that included Jews, who were sent to the slave labor camp at Buchenwald known as Berga in February 1945. Half of the soldiers sent there did not make it out alive. During his captivity, Acevedo began to keep a journal in which he documented the harrowing experiences he and his fellow prisoners faced, including recording every US death he observed. He detailed the cruel treatment they received at the hands of their captors. Among the many horrifying experiences, Acevedo was forced to fill bullet holes left in the heads of dead soldiers with wax to mask evidence of shootings. He told CNN in 2008 that dandelion leaves were a \\"gourmet meal\\" compared to their normal rations, which included soup cooked from rats and cats, and bread made from sawdust, ground glass, and barley. Acevedo's journal was a testament to the soldiers' will to survive under such brutal conditions. The Press-Enterprise reports that by April 1945, he weighed just 87 pounds. Bringing Attention to the Underserved It wasn't until Acevedo went public with his story in 2008 that the US took responsibility for and acknowledged the ordeal of the soldiers kept at Berga. In 2010, Acevedo donated his diary, which he had concealed in his pants and written using ink mixed with urine or snow, to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Conclusion Anthony Acevedo's life story is one of unyielding passion for his homeland, indomitable will to survive, and unwavering dedication to justice. The courage and resilience he demonstrated throughout his life, and the importance he placed on preserving the stories of those wrongfully held captive, deserves to be remembered and honored. Acevedo passed away on February 11, 2018, at the age of 93, but his legacy lives on through his journal and the recognition he finally achieved for hundreds of 'undesirable' American soldiers who faced the horrors of captivity during World War II. The memory of Anthony Acevedo serves as a reminder that heroism can be found in the most dire of circumstances and should never be forgotten."},{"question":"Zweitens, Herr Kommissar Brittan, wurde die Verordnung 96 - die, das wurde heute hier gesagt, von der Kommission vorgelegt worden war - vom Parlament in erster Lesung zurückgewiesen.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism.

Combined, the chemicals form bleach. The BBC has also learned the secret location of a conference to begin in Surrey on Friday to promote the 'cure'. When confronted with the evidence, Mr Edwards made no comment. Mr Edwards has been linked to the Genesis II Church, an American organisation which describes itself as a \\"non-religious church of health and healing\\". This is purportedly achieved through the used of so-called \\"Miracle Mineral Solution\\" (MMS), a bleach which is produced by mixing the two chemicals. Experts said it is untrue any such mixture could cure autism and warned its use could lead to serious harm or death. Some of the leading figures in the 'church' have travelled from the US to attend the conference, due to take place in a manor house in Farnham. Emails obtained by the BBC show delegates have been told to meet at a certain location before being driven to the venue, where they will be instructed in preparing doses of MMS to be consumed orally and taken via enemas. Through his website, Mr Edwards, who says he is not attending the conference, sold the researcher the one bottle of liquid labelled as 22.4% sodium chlorite and a second labelled as 4% hydrochloric acid. When the BBC sent the chemicals to Kent Scientific Services, an independent laboratory, they were found to be 57% and 45% stronger than the advertised concentration respectively. The researcher then met Mr Edwards at King's Cross Station for a paid-for demonstration as to how they should be mixed and imbibed. Mr Edwards told him: \\"It's helping people get well from all sorts of diseases - cancer, HIV, malaria. It's cleaning the body out. And nearly all the illnesses are getting removed with this. \\"I'm not gonna say cure... because I can get in trouble. I'd say purge. It can purge autism. Alzheimer's too. \\"170 children have had their diagnosis removed of autism in four years.\\" Mr Edwards advised 27 drops of MMS per day for a baby - administered with a baby's bottle. Of his own use, he said: \\"I put it in my eyes, my nose, my ears, bathe in it, drunk it, breathed it in my lungs. I got injected in my butt with it. \\"They're never gonna shut me down. All they can do is put me in a prison cell.\\" Last month a jury in the US state of Washington convicted Genesis II member Louis Daniel Smith for selling MMS as a \\"miracle cure\\". He faces a maximum of 34 years in prison. Carol Povey, of the National Autistic Society, said: \\"No evidence of any kind exists to support the preposterous claims made for MMS as an intervention for autism. \\"It is shocking that dubious companies continue to promote potentially very harmful products like these. \\"Autism is a complex neurological condition, without a cure.\\" Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP, said ingesting bleach could cause scarring to the oesophagus, damage to the stomach and even death. She explained: \\"A very small amount of concentrated bleach has the possibility of doing great harm. \\"This is particularly true of a child's gut lining, which is thinner than an adults. \\"It is an extra danger that people are self-administering this as the dose could easily be got wrong.\\" Prof Richard Goldberg, expert in pharmaceutical law at Durham Law School, warned selling sodium chlorite for consumption breached the Food Supplements England Regulations. \\"This is a potential criminal offence,\\" he said. \\"The Food Standards Agency has to inform the relevant local authority and the authority has to take action. \\"There is a very strong argument that he is selling an unauthorised food supplement.

Casey is taking his estranged niece Sarah to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Sarah's father. Sarah and Casey board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker and computer genius Travis Dane and mercenary leader Marcus Penn, hijack the train. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane because of his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide. The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley and killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane 1 billion to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional 100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead. As long as the train keeps moving, his location cannot be determined. However, Casey faxes a message to the owner of the Mile High Cafe, who contacts Admiral Bates.

Raymond also gets money by exposing himself (with large kielbasa sausages tied to his penis) to unsuspecting women in a park and stealing their purses when they flee. The Marbles send a spy named Cookie in the guise of what Crackers thinks is a date.

Le: OK, so how can I answer with some explanation?","response":"To answer Denny's question, we need to analyze both sentences and compare them to see if the second statement can be deduced from the first one. 1. In the first sentence, \\"A shirtless boy punches snow,\\" we know the following: a) There is a boy. b) The boy is shirtless. c) The boy punches snow. 2. In the second sentence, \\"A boy punches snow out of anger,\\" we know the following: a) There is a boy. b) The boy punches snow. c) The punch is motivated by anger. Now, let's compare them: - Both sentences mention a boy who punches snow, so those aspects match. - The first sentence mentions that the boy is shirtless, while the second sentence does not. However, this does not contradict the second sentence or provide any information about the boy's emotional state. - The second sentence claims the punch is motivated by anger, while this information is absent in the first sentence. Based on the comparison, we cannot assume that the second statement is true solely based on the information given in the first sentence. There is no indication of the boy's emotional state or motive for punching the snow in the first sentence.

In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G.

The answer to this question is:","response":"Esther Raziel-Naor was a significant political figure in Israel who was born on November 29, 1911, in Smarhoń, a city in the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). Throughout her life, she was associated with two major political parties: Herut and Gahal. She actively participated in politics, playing essential roles and shaping the landscape of political discourse in Israel. Raziel-Naor's political career began with her involvement in the Herut party from 1949 to 1965. Herut was a nationalist political party in Israel that emerged from the Revisionist Zionist movement, a faction that sought a Jewish state in the entirety of Mandatory Palestine. During her tenure with the Herut party, she advocated for a strong and independent Israel, focusing on issues such as security, economy, and immigration. This period marked the beginning of her political journey and helped her establish a reputation as a dedicated leader. In 1965, Raziel-Naor transitioned to the Gahal party, where she was an active member until 1974. Gahal was an Israeli political alliance formed by the merger of the Herut party and the Liberal Party. She continued her political activism and leadership within the Gahal party, where her experience, dedication, and ability to address various issues contributed to the party's growth. Gahal became one of the dominant right-wing political forces in Israel during its existence, and Raziel-Naor's involvement significantly shaped the party's trajectory. Throughout her political career, Raziel-Naor became known for her steadfast commitment to Israel's development and the realization of the Zionist ideal. She actively participated in various parliamentary committees, ensuring that her voice and the interests of the people she represented were heard. Her diligent work and passion for her country earned her the respect of her contemporaries and a well-deserved place in Israel's political history. Esther Raziel-Naor passed away on November 11, 2002, at the age of 90. Her long-standing political career and legacy continue to influence and inspire future generations of political leaders and activists in Israel."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There has never been a better time than now to buy a new piece of technology, such as a computer.

Massive oil deposits have also recently been discovered in Turkana. What is ground water? When water falls as rain or snow, much of it either flows into rivers or is used to provide moisture to plants and crops. What is left over trickles down to the layers of rock that sit beneath the soil. And just like a giant sponge, this ground water is held in the spaces between the rocks and in the tiny inter-connected spaces between individual grains in a rock like sandstone. These bodies of wet rock are referred to as aquifers. Ground water does not sit still in the aquifer but is pushed and pulled by gravity and the weight of water above it. The movement of the water through the aquifer removes many impurities and it is often cleaner than water on the surface. The BBC's Angela Ng'endo in the capital, Nairobi, says despite its burgeoning wealth, the region's inhabitants have always felt marginalised. Abou Amani, Unesco's Africa hydrologist, urged caution and said it was important not to \\"overexploit\\" the aquifers. \\"We need to put in place a sound management system,\\" he said. The head of the non-governmental organisation Friends of Lake Turkana, Ikal Anglei, said the government also needed to engage more with local communities. \\"Unfortunately they're not creating forums for us to engage with them,\\" she said. \\"It is critical for governments to realise they don't… come up with programmes without community ownership… and linking it to economic development.\\" According to Unesco, about 17 million of Kenya's 41 million people lack access to safe water. ||||| International Discovery Of Massive Aquifers Could Be Game Changer For Kenya i itoggle caption Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images Satellite imagery and seismic data have identified two huge underground aquifers in Kenya's drought-prone north, a discovery that could be \\"a game changer\\" for the country, NPR's Gregory Warner reports. The aquifers, located hundreds of feet underground in the Turkana region that borders Ethiopia and South Sudan, contain billions of gallons of water, according to UNESCO, which confirmed the existence of the subterranean lakes discovered with the help of a French company using technology originally designed to reveal oil deposits. The Lotikipi Basin Aquifer is located west of Lake Turkana, the world's largest permanent desert lake, which nonetheless contains alkaline and unpalatable water. The second discovery is the smaller Lodwar Basin Aquifer. \\"This newly found wealth of water opens a door to a more prosperous future for the people of Turkana and the nation as a whole,\\" said Judi Wakhungu, Cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural Resources. \\"We must now work to further explore these resources responsibly and safeguard them for future generations,\\" she said. \\"If we use the water sustainably, when it comes to water resources we become very secure,\\" Wakhungu said. UNESCO says 40 percent of Kenya's 41 million people lack access to safe water, and 28 million do not have adequate sanitation. NPR's Warner says the subterranean lakes, shaped as scientists describe like a short stack of \\"interconnected pancakes,\\" are naturally replenished by mountain rain. \\"But getting the water to the people could be a challenge,\\" he says. \\"Turkana is the least developed region of Kenya, just south of a disputed border region and scene of frequent deadly tribal clashes.\\" ||||| Scientists say the aquifer may have enough water to fill the parched area's needs indefinitely. Is the English language becoming less significant in Europe after Brexit? Why migrants, en route to the United States, are pausing in Mexico Why the new health-care bill may keep affordable care out of reach for some An aerial view photographed through an aircraft window, shows the Ngamia drilling site in Turkana region, northwestern Kenya, February 13, 2013. Scientists using technology for discovering oil have found a vast underground water reservoir in one of Kenya’s driest regions that could supply the country's needs for nearly 70 years, potentially turning arid zones into lush farmlands. The new reserves are located in a basin in the extreme northwest that has a surface area the size of Delaware, and is estimated to hold billions of gallons, nearly nine times Kenya’s current reserves. Almost half of Kenya’s 41 million people have no access to clean water, and farmers in arid areas struggle to raise crops without adequate irrigation. Scientists say it is possible that, along with water run-off from surrounding hills and plains that replenish the aquifer, the newly discovered resources could fulfill the country's water demands indefinitely. Tapping the new reserves in the basin, located in Kenya's northern Turkana region, may allow for vast new zones of farmland in landscapes where today even the hardiest plants struggle to survive. “The news about these water reserves comes at a time when reliable water supplies are highly needed,” Judi Wakhungu, cabinet secretary at the Kenyan environment, water, and natural resources ministry, said in a statement. “This newly found wealth of water opens a door to a more prosperous future for the people of Turkana and the nation as a whole,\\" Ms. Wakhungu added. “We must now work to further explore these resources responsibly and safeguard them for future generations.\\" The hitch If there is one hitch, the basin is in a remote area in the extreme northwest. It lies close to Kenya's borders with South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda in an area sparsely populated and prone to conflict over existing scarce resources. The land that lies above the reservoir is among the most hostile in Kenya. There are few roads or electricity supplies, and the Turkana, Samburu, and Pokot tribes that live there are regularly at war with each other. The border area between Kenya, South Sudan, and Ethiopia, known as the Ilemi Triangle, has never been officially delineated. Constructing, fueling, and maintaining boreholes, and building pipelines to bring the water supplies to remote communities, can pose significant difficulties. Who found it? The discovery was made by researchers from a Texas-based company, Radar Technologies, with assistance from the Kenyan government and Unesco. The team layered satellite, radar and geological maps on top of each other and then used seismic techniques developed to find oil, to identify the reservoir. “It is important to say that these are early estimates, and these resources must be managed well in order that they benefit the people of Kenya,” says Mohamed Djelid, Unesco’s East Africa director. “But if all goes well, we can say that this really is a game changer.” Kenya’s government will now carry out further drilling in areas surrounding the sites where the new water supplies were first drawn to the surface, to gather more data on their full extent. In the past there have been similar announcements of massive new water finds beneath Africa’s driest areas. In 2007, scientists said that they had identified an underground “megalake” in Sudan’s war-torn Darfur region that was 10 times the size of the Kenyan discovery, but its bounty has yet to be tapped. “Knowing there’s water there, and then getting it to the surface, are two different things,” says Brian McSorley, a water expert at Oxfam in Nairobi. He added that, \\"There will need to be decent follow up studies and then proper investment to ensure that these newly-discovered resources benefit the poorest people.” The aquifers lie as deep as 1,000 feet, which poses significant technological and cost challenges compared to shallower reserves, Mr. McSorley says but notes that, “Having said all that, the figures are encouraging and I think this needs to be cautiously welcomed.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"A massive water source has been discovered in the arid Turkana region of northern Kenya, which could supply the country for 70 years.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"If the thermostat is not working correctly, it can have a direct effect on the process of providing more heat for the house. Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. If the thermostat cannot accurately sense that the room temperature has fallen below the thermostat setting, it may not send a signal to the heating system when it should. This could result in the heating system not being activated when it is needed. 2. Since the heating system does not receive a signal from the thermostat, the oil burner will not be engaged. Consequently, the heating oil will not travel from the tank to the burner and the process of creating a fine mist mixed with air will not occur. 3. Without the fuel/air mixture being injected into the burner, there will be no combustion happening in the combustion chamber. This means no heat will be generated for the house. 4. Eventually, the warm air or hot water will not be disbursed through vents, baseboards, or steam radiators, leading to inadequate heating or even no heating at all in the house. In summary, a malfunctioning thermostat can directly impact the process of providing more heat for the house, as it may not trigger the heating system when necessary, leading to insufficient heating or no heating throughout the home."},{"question":"One spring it stopped raining in early March and didn't start again.

Moving from disbelief to dismay to horror, Europeans lost whatever hopes and illusions they may have harbored that Russia was a predictable and cooperative partner. Instead, images are being invoked of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Hungary in 1956, and a new Cold War seems fully possible now.

The only thing standing in his path were three groups (Taffy 1, 2 and 3) of the Seventh Fleet, commanded by Admiral Thomas Kinkaid. Each group had six escort carriers, with a total of more than 500 planes, and seven or eight destroyers or destroyer escorts (DE). Kinkaid still believed that Lee's force was guarding the north, so the Japanese had the element of surprise when they attacked Taffy 3 at 06:45. Kurita mistook the Taffy carriers for large fleet carriers and thought he had the whole Third Fleet in his sights. Since escort carriers stood little chance against a battleship, Adm. Clifton Sprague directed the carriers of Taffy 3 to turn and flee eastward, hoping that bad visibility would reduce the accuracy of Japanese gunfire, and used his destroyers to divert the Japanese battleships. The destroyers made harassing torpedo attacks against the Japanese. For ten minutes Yamato was caught up in evasive action. Two U.S. destroyers and a DE were sunk, but they had bought enough time for the Taffy groups to launch planes. Taffy 3 turned and fled south, with shells scoring hits on some of its carriers and sinking one of them. The superior speed of the Japanese force allowed it to draw closer and fire on the other two Taffy groups. However, at 09:20 Kurita suddenly turned and retreated north. Signals had disabused him of the notion that he was attacking the Third Fleet, and the longer Kurita continued to engage, the greater the risk of major air strikes. Destroyer attacks had broken the Japanese formations, shattering tactical control. Three of Kurita's heavy cruisers had been sunk and another was too damaged to continue the fight. The Japanese retreated through the San Bernardino Strait, under continuous air attack. The Battle of Leyte Gulf was over; and a large part of the Japanese surface fleet destroyed.

We can also term it as \\"self-raising\\". In slow parenting children are allowed to do what they think proper and parents just keep a watch over the child. Curiosity of the child leads to exploring and discovering things. Parents provide little help only when it's too necessary, otherwise keep themselves away from the child and just have a look on him/her: This brings about a feeling of self-dependency and they are encouraged to solve their problems. This is a natural way of learning. When a child is left to learn in a natural environment, the child's natural development takes place. Influence of any materialistic way doesn't let the mind develop naturally. Watching TV, playing video games or joining classes of dance, swimming or any other sports will not let the mind develop naturally. Here creativity of their mind is developed. They explore ideas. The logic behind this is that the kids of animals learn by nature, so can our kids. So let our children play in the garden, to watch flowers, plants, birds, butterflies and other gifts of nature. In the classes of dance, swimming etc. their creativity is influenced and their natural creativity is suppressed . In these classes they are overburdened and can't train their creativity. So let them play in the open air or garden without any burden instead of joining classes. Generally parents give toys to their children and explain how to operate them. But those parents who believe in slow parenting give toys and observe how the children are managing them. Their skill to learn and understand comes out.

Chlorophyll is a pigment present in the cells of plants that captures light energy, enabling the plant to start the process of converting light energy into chemical energy (in the form of glucose or sugar). The rest of the steps concerning the absorption of carbon dioxide, water and minerals are closely linked to this initial light-capturing process.

Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross.

The Danzig army, led by the German mercenary commander Johann Winkelbruch , was about 7,000-12,000 strong , but with less than 1,000 cavalry. Winckelburg decided to crush the small army of Zborowski , but the Danzig army was utterly defeated by Zborowski in the battle of Lubiszewo on 17 April 1577. After the battle, the Danzig forces retreated behind the walls, citizens pulled down trees and houses in front of fortifications and a siege began. Reinforcement with King Batory arrived only in July. During it King Stefan was using heated cannonballs and turned back the flow of the Radunia river. Bathory had about 11,000 men, and Danzig, about 10,000. A surprise attack by the Danzigers managed to destroy two-thirds of the Polish artillery, vastly slowing the progress of the siege.

What is the solution?","response":"To solve the equation 0 = 248*s - 260*s - 120 for s, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with s. We have two terms with s: 248*s and -260*s. Combining these terms, we get: 248*s - 260*s = -12*s, so the equation becomes: 0 = -12*s - 120 Step 2: Isolate the s term. To isolate the s term, we need to get rid of the constant term, which is -120 in this case. To do that, we add 120 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 120 = -12*s - 120 + 120 This simplifies to: 120 = -12*s Step 3: Solve for s. Now, we need to get s by itself. To do that, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -12: 120 / -12 = (-12*s) / -12 This simplifies to: -10 = s So, the solution is s = -10."},{"question":"Question: when did the oakland raiders move to los angeles?? Answer:","response":"The Oakland Raiders, a professional American football team, moved to Los Angeles in 1982. The team was initially established in Oakland, California, back in 1960, and was a part of the inaugural eight-team American Football League (AFL). However, following the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, the Raiders joined the National Football League (NFL) and remained based in Oakland until 1981. One factor that prompted the team's relocation was the desire for better facilities, specifically a modernized stadium. The then-owner of the team, Al Davis, was unhappy with the conditions at the Oakland Coliseum. Negotiations between Davis and the city of Oakland did not result in any agreement for the stadium renovation, leading Davis to explore other options for relocating the team. On March 1, 1980, the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission offered the Raiders a lucrative deal to move to Los Angeles, which included improvements to the Los Angeles Coliseum and revenue-sharing opportunities. A few months later, in May 1980, the NFL team owners voted not to allow the Oakland Raiders to move. Despite that, Davis decided to take legal action against the NFL, arguing that the league had violated antitrust laws by preventing the relocation. The case went to trial in 1981, and on May 7, 1982, a federal district court jury ruled in favor of the Raiders and allowed the team to relocate to Los Angeles. Following the legal victory, the Oakland Raiders officially moved to Los Angeles for the 1982 NFL season, changing their name to the Los Angeles Raiders. The team continued to play in Los Angeles until 1994. At the end of the 1994 season, the team moved back to Oakland and reclaimed their original name, the Oakland Raiders. They remained there until they relocated again to Las Vegas, Nevada, and became the Las Vegas Raiders in 2020."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Article: Modern man has cleared the forests for farmland and for wood, and has also carelessly burned them. More than that, though, he has also interfered with the invisible bonds between the living things in the forests. There are many examples of this kind of destruction. The harmfulness of man's interference can be seen in what happened many years ago in the forest of the Kaibab plateau of northern Arizona. Man tried to improve on the natural web of forest life and destroyed it instead. The Kaibab had a storybook forest of large sized pine, Douglas fir, white fir, blue and _ . In 1882 a visitor noted, \\"We, who ... have wandered through its forests and parks, have come to regard it as the most enchanting region it has ever been our privilege to visit.\\" This was also the living place of the Rocky Mountain mule deer. Indians hunted there every autumn to gather meat and skins. The forest also had mountain lions, timber wolves and bobcats that kept the deer from multiplying too rapidly. Then, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve. Deer hunting was forbidden. Government hunters started killing off the deer's enemies. In 25 years' time, 6,250 mountain lions, wolves and bobcats were killed. Before the program, there were about 4,000 deer in the Kaibab, by 1924, there were about 100,000. The deer ate every leaf and twig they could reach. But there was not nearly enough food. Hunting of deer was permitted again. This caused a slight decrease in the deer herd ,but a far greater loss resulted from starvation and disease. Some 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters. By 1930 the herd had dropped to 20,000 animals. By 1942 it was down to 8,000. Question: Years later, large numbers of deer in the Kaibab died mainly because of . Answer: Answer:","response":"Years later, large numbers of deer in the Kaibab died mainly because of the imbalance created in the ecosystem due to human interference. This led to overpopulation of deer, which in turn resulted in insufficient food resources, increased competition, and the spread of starvation and disease among the deer population. When President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve in 1906, deer hunting was forbidden, and government hunters started eliminating the deer's natural predators, such as mountain lions, wolves, and bobcats. This action disrupted the natural balance of the ecosystem, allowing the deer population to increase rapidly from around 4,000 to about 100,000 by 1924. As a consequence of this dramatic increase in deer population, the available food resources in the Kaibab forest were overexploited. The deer consumed every leaf and twig they could reach, leading to a severe shortage of food. This situation eventually forced the authorities to allow deer hunting again, which helped in reducing the deer population slightly. However, the more significant reduction in deer numbers resulted from starvation and disease, causing around 60% of the deer herd to die over two winters. By 1930, the deer population had dropped to 20,000, and by 1942, it decreased further to 8,000. In summary, the primary reason for the large number of deer deaths in the Kaibab years later was the disruption of the natural balance in the forest ecosystem due to human intervention, leading to overpopulation, limited food resources, and the widespread effects of starvation and disease."},{"question":"Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I am not a parent, neither am I a male.

Answer: Sentence B Stream-of-consciousness Explanation: Well, let's think about what passive voice is. Passive voice is when the subject of the sentence is acted upon, rather than performing the action. So, we would be looking for a sentence where the subject isn't doing the action directly, but rather something is being done to it. Now let's imagine two sentences for the sake of comparison. Let's take an example of a basketball game. Sentence A: \\"The player swiftly dribbled the ball.\\" Sentence B: \\"The ball was swiftly dribbled by the player.\\" Sentence A shows a clear and direct action being performed by the subject (\\"The player\\"). The verb is \\"dribbled\\" and it's done by the subject. In Sentence B, however, the focus is on \\"The ball,\\" which is the subject, and the action is performed on it, rather than by it, making it passive voice. The verb is still \\"dribbled,\\" but it's happening to the subject rather than the subject doing it. So in this case, Sentence B is the one that demonstrates a passive voice construction, and that's our answer."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

I was used to tidy living rooms that seemed to whisper, \\"Not to be touched!\\" I can still remember one afternoon when I was eight years old. Since my first visit to the farm, I had wanted more than anything to be allowed to climb the stone walls surrounding the houses. My parents would never _ . The walls were old; some stones were missing, others loose and falling. Still, my idea to climb across those walls grew so strong that finally, one spring afternoon, I had all my courage to enter the living room, where the adults had gathered after Sunday dinner. \\"I, uh-I want to climb the stone walls,\\" I said. Everyone looked up. \\"Can I climb the stone walls? \\"Immediately voices of disagreement went up from the women in the room. \\"Heavens, no!\\" You'll hurt yourself!\\" I wasn't too disappointed; the response was just as I'd expected.

Hi little friends! Today, we're going to talk about something super duper important for our feet. Do you know what I'm talking about? That's right, insoles! Insoles are those comfy, soft things inside our shoes that feel oh-so-nice when we walk or run around. They're like our feet's best friends. Sometimes, our insoles can become dirty or wet. When that happens, it's time to give them a little spa day, just like when we take a bath! To make sure our insoles stay clean and happy, we need to set them aside to dry. Let me explain how we can do that. Step 1: Wiggle Those Insoles Out First, we need to take our insoles out of our shoes. Gently wiggle them from side to side, like how a little puppy wags its tail. This helps loosen the insoles so that we can grab them easily. Be sure to remember which shoe they came from so we can put them back in the right place later. Step 2: Clean With Care If our insoles are dirty, let's give them a gentle clean with a soft brush or cloth. We can borrow it from our grown-ups. Remember, we don't want to hurt our insoles - they're our feet's best friends, after all. If they're really dirty, we can ask for an adult's help to rinse them under some warm water. Step 3: Find a Good Drying Spot Now that our insoles are all clean, it's time to help them dry. We need to find a place that is nice and warm, but not too hot or sunny. A good spot might be near a window, or even near a warm heater (but not too close!). Make sure to ask your grown-up if it's a safe place, because sometimes heaters can get really hot, and we don't want our insoles getting too warm. Step 4: Insole Drying Time We're almost done, little friend! Now that we've found a good drying spot for our insoles, it's time to set them down flat, like a pancake. Be sure to put a towel or paper towel underneath them so that the wetness doesn't spread. Make sure they are not folded or bent; we want them to stay nice and flat so that they still fit well in our shoes. Step 5: Checking on Our Insoles Our insoles will need some time to dry - maybe a good night's sleep or a whole day of adventures. We can check on them to see if they're dry by touching them gently with our fingers. When they feel nice and dry, it's time to put them back into our shoes! Yay! We did it! Now our insoles are all nice, clean, and dry, and they're ready to support our feet again as we go on more amazing adventures. Remember to take good care of your insoles, and they'll take good care of your feet. Happy walking and playing, my little friends!"},{"question":"What is a good description of the sloth's native habitat? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question.

THE HOSPITAL OF ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST, CAMBRIDGE The tradition that this hospital was founded by Bishop Niel of Ely in the reign of Henry I appears to have been started by Archbishop Mathew Parker (fn. 1) and to have no foundation. (fn. 2) The earliest direct reference to the hospital is a grant of protection to 'the house and brethren of the Hospital of St. John' in 1204. (fn. 3) In 1207 the king claimed the advowson of the church of St. Peter (later known as Little St. Mary's) against Herbert the chaplain, Reynold son of Alfred, William de Caldecot, and Ives de Pipestre; they showed that the church had descended to Henry son of Segar, who had given it to the Hospital of Cambridge, and the verdict was that the hospital should have it. (fn. 4) Presumably Herbert was the master and the other three were brethren of the hospital. According to an inquiry (fn. 5) made in 1274 the hospital was founded on a valueless piece of waste ground belonging to the commonalty of the town of Cambridge, with whose assent Henry Eldcorn erected a wretched hovel to lodge paupers. He later obtained from Bishop Eustace (1197-1215) leave for the paupers to have an oratory and burial-ground. Eustace himself conferred the church of Horningsea upon the hospital, and in return the burgesses gave the patronage to the bishop. The jury add that it happened so long ago that they do not know whether it was in the time of King Richard or King John. As the site of the hospital was within the parish of All Saints, which belonged to the nunnery of St. Radegund, Bishop Eustace ordained that every master appointed should swear not to receive any parishioners of All Saints to the sacraments, or to take oblations from them, to the damage of that church. At the same time three burgesses gave the nuns rents to the value of 3s. in recompense for the loss of the land, and for the right of the brethren to bury members of the hospital. (fn. 6) According to another return, made in 1279, the site on which the hospital and chapel stood had been given for that purpose by one Henry Frost to the burgesses, who ought to have been patrons but had been deprived of the right of appointing the master by Bishop Hugh de Northwold some 30 years previously. (fn. 7) The two Henries (if they are not identical) may have been acting on behalf of the inchoate commonalty. The hospital may therefore be said to have been founded about 1200. It soon received endowments, mostly small gifts of messuages and crofts from members of burgess families. (fn. 8) At the head of the roll of benefactors (fn. 9) stood Bishop Eustace, who not only gave them the church of Horningsea, reserving a vicarage of £5, but also allowed them to appropriate the church of St. Peter. (fn. 10) Next stood the family of Mortimer: one of them, Robert, received from King John land to the yearly value of £5 in Newnham in 1206, (fn. 11) which he or his son William had given to the hospital before 1212, when the men of Cambridge were paying the £5, as part of their fee farm, to William for the land 'which the brethren of the hospital have'. (fn. 12) A remarkable instance of the endowment of beds in the hospital is found when Hervey [Dunning] son of Eustace, who died c. 1240, gave to St. John's 7 acres in the fields of Chesterton, in return for which the master and brethren granted to him and his heirs two beds, with the necessary bedclothes, for the use of the sick in the stone house of the hospital. (fn. 13) Hervey's son Eustace gave the brethren his lands in Madingley, for which they agreed to maintain a chaplain of their house to celebrate yearly for his soul and those of his ancestors. (fn. 14) In 1250 the hospital obtained a bull from Innocent IV (fn. 15) taking them, with their possessions and privileges, expressly under papal protection. The bull contains the usual clauses against violence within the inclosures or granges, of exemption from certain tithes and exactions, right of sanctuary, burial, and the saying of low mass with closed doors during an interdict, and another, important at this juncture in the history of the house, that the 'prior' must be elected according to the Rule of St. Augustine, which Rule, instituted in the church of St. John, was to be inviolably observed there for ever. This may be the Rule preserved in the college muniments, upon which the Rule of the Hospital of St. John Baptist at Ely (q.v.) was based. The Rule begins by laying down that all the brethren, clerical and lay, are to live as Regulars, to eat together, and to sleep in one dormitory, if the accommodation of the house allows of this, otherwise the priests are to sleep in one building, and the laymen in another near it. There is to be silence in the chapel during celebration, and no one is to absent himself from mass or the Hours except for evident necessity. Every chaplain is to have 20s. a year for clothing money; each layman 13s. 4d., and the prior or master 40s. The master is also to receive a double portion of food and drink. All are to wear a habit of the same colour, and not to appear in choir or outside the gates without it. Sick brethren are to be used with all kindness, assigned a separate room where they can eat meat, and to enjoy such comforts as the means of the house allow. All occasion of acquiring private property is to be avoided. Quarrels are to be punished according to their degree. No one is to eat or drink outside the house without the prior's licence, and the bishop 'most strictly commands, upon their obedience' that they receive the sick and infirm with all kindness and mercy, except only pregnant women, lepers, the wounded, the paralysed, and the insane. The beds and bedding of the sick are to be inspected by the prior, or by some one deputed by him, and their food is to be as good as the house can afford. Above all, clerics as well as lay brethren are to obey the prior in all things concerning the good of the house, according to this Rule and the constitution of their Order. A chapter is to be held once a week: the brethren each and all are to go to confession to their own prior, unless they have an indult. (fn. 16) The Rule is to be publicly read in chapter twice or thrice in the year. Lay brethren are to say 20 Paternosters and 20 Aves for Matins, wherever they may be, 7 Paters and 7 Aves for each of the other Hours, and one Pater and one Ave for grace both before and after meat. About the year 1267 Bishop Hugh de Balsham allowed the hospital to appropriate the vicarage of Horningsea and have the church served by a suitable chaplain sent out from the congregation of the hospital 'or elsewhere', because the house had suffered from depreciation of its property and from a fire, but also because of 'the great confluence of the sick and poor to your place'. (fn. 17) On 24 December 1280 he obtained the king's licence to make his famous experiment of introducing into 'his Hospital of St. John studious scholars living after the rule of the scholars of Oxford called of Merton', in place of the secular brethren. (fn. 18) Either because the hospital, to which there was constant resort of sick and poor, was found to be an unsuitable residence for scholars, or because his ideas had expanded, the bishop in 1284 took steps to remove his scholars to two hostels outside the Trumpington Gate adjoining the church of St. Peter, and thus inaugurated the first Cambridge college, Peterhouse. (fn. 19) The site of the college and the church, which he bestowed on his new foundation, belonged to the hospital, to which he assigned other lands and rents in compensation. There seems some evidence that the hospital occasionally received scholars as boarders, as in 1327 an order was made that food seized from forestallers and regraters should be given to the Master of the Hospital of St. John for the support of 'poor scholars and sick persons' there; (fn. 20) and this order was repeated in 1378. (fn. 21) The lay brethren displaced by Balsham do not seem to have been reintroduced and their place was apparently taken by boarders. Thus in 1377 when John de Stanton, rector of Rampton, died in the hospital, one of his executors was Richard Trukke, commorans in domo; and in the following year Christine de Luyton corrodiaria et prehendinans infra domum, and one Robert, formerly servant of John Segeirle, also described as prehendinans et commorans infra domum, died there. (fn. 22) Although, as already mentioned, the Bishops of Ely had for many years appointed the masters, when William de Gosefeld resigned in January 1333 the brethren of the hospital, John de Shelford, John de Berton, Robert de Sprouston, and Alan de Hemmyngeston, announced to Bishop John de Hotham their choice of Alexander de Ixnyng, one of their number, and asked him to institute him as master. (fn. 23) This he did and took the opportunity to issue a letter, or ordinance, concerning future appointments, which was confirmed by John Crauden, Prior of Ely, and the convent, and on 2 March by King Edward III. In this, after denouncing the injuries done to the hospital and the cause of charity by some of the clerks who had ruled it, he laid down the rule that in future, on a vacancy occurring, the brethren should nominate one of their own number to the bishop. If it so happened that there was no member of their body suitable, then they should choose one of the brethren of the Hospital of St. John at Ely. If neither body could produce a fit candidate, then the bishop should appoint, but on future vacancies the presentation should revert to the brethren. (fn. 24) The hospital seems to have been in a flourishing condition at this time, as in 1341 when assessment was made in Cambridge for the subsidy of a ninth of the value of movable chattels the master was rated at £9, (fn. 25) a sum only exceeded by the Prior of Barnwell (£13 10s.) and only approached by the Gilbertine canons of St. Edmund (£8 4s.). On 15 December 1341 the Bishop of Ely (fn. 26) gave a licence to Brother Alexander, Master of the Hospital of St. John, and to each of the brethren to say mass 'in a suitable part of the Hospital', a permission which suggests that the chapel may have been under repair; and on 16 February 1347, Thomas de Lisle, Bishop Montacute's successor, licensed Brother Alexander (fn. 27) to hear the confessions of the parishioners of Horningsea from the beginning of Lent to Easter. In April 1349 the Black Death fell upon the hospital. On 2 May Brother Robert de Sprouston (fn. 28) was nominated, admitted, and inducted upon the death of Alexander de Ixnyng. (fn. 29) The brethren named as taking part in this election are Alan de Heningeston, William Beer, Roger Broom, and Richard de Schetlyngton. Robert de Sprouston seems to have died at once, and Roger Broom was elected by the other three. (fn. 30) Early in June he too died, and on 28 June William Beer was admitted to the mastership, being elected by Richard de Schetlyngton and John de Swaffham. (fn. 31) It seems probable that Alan had also died, leaving only two of the brethren alive, and that John de Swaffham had joined the community during June. The Chancellor of the diocese, as one of Lisle's vicarsgeneral, installed William with all speed, seeing 'how much danger threatens the hospital through lack of a Custos'. William Beer was master in 1362, when he and the brethren were licensed to receive from John de Seggewelle and Robert de Wynpole, rector of Kirtling, 3 messuages, 11 cottages, and 3 acres of land in Cambridge and some 30 acres in neighbouring villages. (fn. 32) This was probably a purchase for investment and not a pious gift. On Friday 29 July 1373, Thomas de Wormenhale visited the Hospital of St. John. The chief comperta as regards discipline were that the brethren did not make their confessions to the master, as they were bound to do. It was also reported that the buildings were falling down for lack of repair. The master at this time was still William Beer. (fn. 33) It was not long after this that one William Potton entered the hospital, was professed as of the Rule of St. Augustine as a brother of the house, (fn. 34) and received sub-deacon's orders. After he had been there rather over a year, it was found that shortly before his entry he had married Agnes Knotte, widow of Ralph Clerk, at whose suit he was discharged of his religious profession and restored to her as her husband. (fn. 35) In 1393 Pope Boniface IX granted a relaxation of penance to penitents who on the feast of St. John visited and gave alms to the church of the hospital; (fn. 36) and about 1470 Thomas Rotherham, Bishop of Lincoln, and Chancellor of the University, in view of the injuries often done to the hospital by laymen, extended to its brethren and servants the privileges of membership of the University. (fn. 37) At the end of 1477 the Pope commissioned the Archdeacon of Ely to deal with a petition of the master and brethren (here definitely said to be of the Order of St. Augustine) that masses for the souls of Sir John Moreys and his parents Stephen and Denise Moreys, for which the said John had given them lands producing 100s. yearly, might in future be said in their own church of St. John instead of in St. Botolph's. (fn. 38) As a result of the extension of the privileges of the University to the hospital St. John's House ranked as a college, and as such was exempted from the subsidy of 1500. (fn. 39) By this time, however, the hospital was falling into decay; the brethren were few in number and lax in character, and the estates were in danger of being dissipated. (fn. 40) The Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII, having founded Christ's College, projected another scholastic foundation and was persuaded by John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, to place it here. (fn. 41) On 10 March 1509 she and James Stanley (her stepson), Bishop of Ely, agreed upon the conversion of St. John's into a college, (fn. 42) and although after her death, on the following 29 June, the bishop held matters up for more than a year, (fn. 43) when a papal bull suppressing the hospital had been obtained he gave his consent and wrote to 'the fellows of St. John's House in Cambridge' advising them to resign and promising that they should each have an annuity of 8 marks for life. (fn. 44) There were at this time, besides the master, William Tomlyn, only three brethren— Sir Christopher Wright, Sir John Ketenham, and Sir William Chandeler, none of whom, judging from the title 'Sir', was a graduate. (fn. 45) On 20 January 1511 the bishop's commissary handed over the hospital to the executors of Lady Margaret.

Legend: IN PRINCIPIO ERAT VERBVM. ||||| The audience of an event at this year’s Cambridge Science Festival found themselves staring into the face of a fellow Cambridge resident – one who spent the last 700 years buried beneath the venue in which they sat. The 13th-century man, called Context 958 by researchers, was among some 400 burials for which complete skeletal remains were uncovered when one of the largest medieval hospital graveyards in Britain was discovered underneath the Old Divinity School of St John’s College, and excavated between 2010 and 2012. The bodies, which mostly date from a period spanning the 13th to 15th centuries, are burials from the Hospital of St John the Evangelist which stood opposite the graveyard until 1511, and from which the College takes its name. The hospital was an Augustinian charitable establishment in Cambridge dedicated to providing care to members of the public. “Context 958 was probably an inmate of the Hospital of St John, a charitable institution which provided food and a place to live for a dozen or so indigent townspeople – some of whom were probably ill, some of whom were aged or poor and couldn't live alone,” said Professor John Robb, from the University’s Division of Archaeology. In collaboration with Dr Chris Rynn from the University of Dundee’s Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification, Robb and Cambridge colleagues have reconstructed the man’s face and pieced together the rudiments of his life story by analysing his bones and teeth. The work is one of the first outputs from the Wellcome Trust-funded project ‘After the plague: health and history in medieval Cambridge’ for which Robb is principal investigator. The project is analysing the St John's burials not just statistically, but also biographically. “Context 958 was over 40 when he died, and had quite a robust skeleton with a lot of wear and tear from a hard working life. We can't say what job specifically he did, but he was a working class person, perhaps with a specialised trade of some kind,” said Robb. “One interesting feature is that he had a diet relatively rich in meat or fish, which may suggest that he was in a trade or job which gave him more access to these foods than a poor person might have normally had. He had fallen on hard times, perhaps through illness, limiting his ability to continue working or through not having a family network to take care of him in his poverty.” There are hints beyond his interment in the hospital’s graveyard that Context 958’s life was one of adversity. His tooth enamel had stopped growing on two occasions during his youth, suggesting he had suffered bouts of sickness or famine early on. Archaeologists also found evidence of a blunt-force trauma on the back of his skull that had healed over prior to his death. Click on images below to enlarge: The face of Context 958.

Cessford 4 of 4 Prev Prev Next “He has a few unusual features, notably being buried face down which is a small irregularity for medieval burial. But, we are interested in him and in people like him more for ways in which they are not unusual, as they represent a sector of the medieval population which is quite hard to learn about: ordinary poor people,” said Robb. “Most historical records are about well-off people and especially their financial and legal transactions – the less money and property you had, the less likely anybody was to ever write down anything about you. So skeletons like this are really our chance to learn about how the ordinary poor lived.” The focal point of the ‘After the Plague’ project will be the large sample of urban poor people from the graveyard of the Hospital of St John, which researchers will compare with other medieval collections to build up a picture of the lives, health and day-to-day activities of people living in Cambridge, and urban England as a whole, at this time. “The After the Plague project is also about humanising people in the past, getting beyond the scientific facts to see them as individuals with life stories and experiences,” said Robb. “This helps us communicate our work to the public, but it also helps us imagine them ourselves as leading complex lives like we do today. That's why putting all the data together into biographies and giving them faces is so important.” The Old Divinity School of St John’s College was built in 1877-1879 and was recently refurbished, now housing a 180-seat lecture theatre used for College activities and public events, including last week’s Science Festival lecture given by Robb on the life of Context 958 and the research project. The School was formerly the burial ground of the Hospital, instituted around 1195 by the townspeople of Cambridge to care for the poor and sick in the community. Originally a small building on a patch of waste ground, the Hospital grew with Church support to be a noted place of hospitality and care for both University scholars and local people. ||||| This may look like a photograph, but the highly realistic face staring back at you belongs to a man who died over 700 years ago. The researchers who performed this unbelievable facial reconstruction say their work is providing new details about the way ordinary people lived in medieval England. This 13th-century man—dubbed “Context 958\\"—is one of approximately 400 complete burials found and excavated beneath the Old Divinity School of St. John’s College in Cambridge, England, between 2010 and 2012. Back during the medieval era, this spot was home to the Hospital of St. John, a charitable institution set up to care for the poor and sick in the community. For centuries, the dead were buried in a cemetery right out back. Advertisement The reconstruction of Context 958 is part of a collaborative effort between Cambridge University’s Division of Archaeology and the University of Dundee’s Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification. The Wellcome Trust-funded project, called “After the plague: health and history in medieval Cambridge,” is an effort to catalogue and analyze the burials in as much depth and detail as possible. Based on an exhaustive analysis of his remains and the burial site, here’s what we know about Context 958. Advertisement He was just slightly over 40 years old when he died. His skeleton showed signs of considerable wear-and-tear, so he likely lead a tough and hard working life. His tooth enamel stopped growing during two occasions in his youth, suggesting he likely lived through bouts of famine or sickness when he was young. The archaeologists found traces of blunt force trauma inflicted to the back of his head, which healed over before he died. The researchers aren’t sure what he did for a living, but they think he was a working-class person who specialized in some kind of trade. Context 958 ate a diverse diet rich in meat or fish, according to an analysis of weathering patterns on his teeth. His profession may have provided him with more access to such foods than the average person at the time. His presence at the charitable hospital suggests he fell on hard times, with no one to take care of him. Advertisement “Context 958 was probably an inmate of the Hospital of St John, a charitable institution which provided food and a place to live for a dozen or so indigent townspeople—some of whom were probably ill, some of whom were aged or poor and couldn’t live alone,” noted John Robb, a professor from Cambridge University’s Division of Archaeology, in a statement. Strangely, he was buried face down, which is rare but not unheard of in medieval burials. Robb and his colleagues are fascinated by Context 958 and those like him. Their analysis shows what it was like to live as an ordinary poor person back then—warts and all. Advertisement “Most historical records are about well-off people and especially their financial and legal transactions—the less money and property you had, the less likely anybody was to ever write down anything about you,” said Robb. “So skeletons like this are really our chance to learn about how the ordinary poor lived.” Of course, facial reconstructions are only as good as the data they’re based on, in this case a highly-weathered skeleton. We can’t be completely certain that this is exactly what Context 958 looked like. But at the very least, it’s bringing his remains back to life. Work on other skeletons found at the site will continue, as the researchers are putting together a kind of biography of every individual studied. It’s a fitting tribute to regular folks whose lives would have otherwise been completely forgotten.

Known by archaeologists as \\"Context 958,\\" the man's skeletal remains were one of approximately 400 complete burials discovered beneath the Old Divinity School at St John’s College, Cambridge between 2010 and 2012. This site was previously home to the Hospital of St. John, which provided care for the less fortunate members of society. The researchers have ascertained several details about the life of Context 958. He was about 40 years old when he died, his bones showed signs of robust physical labour throughout his lifetime, he endured times of sickness or famine in his youth, and he had recovered from significant trauma to his skull. In terms of his diet, it was found that Context 958 had better access to meat or fish, indicating a possible trade or profession that was uncommon for the average person of his time. His remains at the hospital suggest that he might have fallen into poverty, illness, or old age without a support system. The position of Context 958's burial was peculiar; he was interred face down, a rarity during the medieval times. These discoveries shed light on the lives of ordinary people from the medieval era, whose history is often elusive due to the lack of written records about the lower classes during that time period."},{"question":"If \\"A woman runs along the shore.\\", does this mean that \\"A woman is slowly walking by the shore.\\"?

It's one of 40 films featured in the festival. But it was memorable for another reason. The film was the first box office hit directed by a Latino filmmaker and starring mostly Latino actors, said Chon Noriega, a professor of cinema and media studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. \\"La Bamba\\" is part of the Latino Images in Film festival, which begins Tuesday and runs through May on Turner Classic Movies. The event features 40 films that show how Latinos have been depicted on the big screen and is part of the network's \\"Race and Hollywood\\" series. (Turner Classic Movies, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) Noriega, who chose the films and also co-hosts the festival, talked with CNN.com about what he hopes viewers will take away from the movie line-up. Watch clips from some of the classic films ». The following is a edited version of that interview. CNN: What was your selection process? Chon Noriega: I decided I was going to focus specifically on Hollywood films that look substantively at either Latino characters or the Latino community. I came up with a master list of films, and it's only about 70. There really haven't been that many that have dealt explicitly with the Latino population. And then, from there, we looked at what was available. CNN: When you talk about Latino images, who do you include in that description? Noriega: It's a kind of pan-ethnic, multiracial category. But basically in terms of the series, what it reflects is Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. There really haven't been, as far as I can tell, many Hollywood films that go beyond those three major groups. CNN: What do you hope to accomplish with this movie lineup? Noriega: By and large, these are films that really haven't been seen since their original release. We really don't have an idea of what the history has been in terms of how Hollywood has dealt with or represented what is now a pretty sizeable part of our population. We have an idea of what the stereotypes have been in terms of the kind of expendable characters that emerge within Westerns or action films, background characters like maids. CNN: What do you mean by expendable characters? Noriega: If I'm watching a science-fiction film and there happens to be a Latino character, I know that that character is going to be the first one to die. (laughs) It is almost inevitable. Or in a Western. They're really not there as characters; they're there as foils for the largely white characters that are defining the film and the story. To my mind, it's valuable just to go back and just see that these are the films that at different points represent how not just Hollywood but our society was trying to figure out where Latinos fit within the national culture. CNN: As people watch these movies, from very early Hollywood to the 1990s, what is the progression of Latino characters? Noriega: I don't know that we see a single trajectory of going from either one thing to another or from bad to better. You see certain recurring figures or types. You see different versions of the gangster kind of morphing into the gang member. But it's more or less an urban outlaw type, and that persists. I think you see little shifts in terms of when they're being made and who is making them. You have some of the same characters in \\"My Family/Mi Familia,\\" but it's being made by a Chicano filmmaker as part of an attempt to show a very diverse view of what a family can be. CNN: What's your take on white actors playing Latino characters? Noriega: Actually, [co-host] Robert Osborne and I kind of went back and forth on that throughout the series because I think there are two views. One is: Actors are actors, and they play make-believe, and they pretend to be different types of characters, and in an ideal world, actors should be able to play anything they are able to do effectively. But when you look at it sociologically, you see it's only working one way, and that's where I think there's a problem. In the history of Hollywood, we're maybe able to identify 70 films that really focus on Latino characters, family or community, and a third of those have white actors playing the Latinos. And Latino actors are not really getting the same opportunity to play other types. CNN: How did the industry try to \\"transform\\" actors into Latino characters? Noriega: The Latino population -- and it's part of the irony of this -- it's not a racial group. It's a multiracial, multi-ethnic group. We talk about that in terms of \\"West Side Story,\\" where everybody's identified how Natalie Wood was in brownface playing a Puerto Rican. But in 1980, there was a revival of it on Broadway, and they actually cast a Puerto Rican actress. In the makeup room, they started putting brownface on her, [because] she wasn't dark enough to meet the expectations of what a Latina character would look like on stage. I've done focus groups with Latino actors in the Screen Actors Guild, and they continually talk about that there are these expectations of what a Latino character is going to look like and more often than not, Latino actors don't look like that. (laughs) CNN: What do you think about how Latinos are portrayed in film today? Noriega: We have a somewhat broader cohort of actors who are known, who are included in films, not always starring, but they get secondary roles in films and so there's in some sense more of a presence. When you look at the statistics in terms of the overall presence of Latinos in film and television, the numbers really haven't changed that much. So it's a kind of a subtle shift.

Images credit Alexander Kira, the Bathroom Book Have a look at your sink after you brush your teeth or shave. There is stuff all over it that you have to clean up. You can't wash your hair in it. Alexander Kira of Cornell University looked at the bathroom sink, and toilet and tub, in the early sixties and was appalled. He wrote: Architects and builders - who actually are the purchasers and who actually are responsible for the design of our bathrooms - must begin to think of hygiene facilities as an important part of the home and as an important aspect of our daily lives rather than as a necessary evil to be accommodated according to the dictates of some obsolete handbook or drawing template in whatever space is left over with whatever part of the budget is minimally required to meet legal standards. Kira's sink is deep at one end, shallow at the other. A hump in the middle spreads the running water all over the bowl to keep it clean. They water shoots up and can act as a drinking fountain, while making it easy to wash one's hair. It is also mounted on a higher vanity, suggesting that the body should be comfortably erect with the hands right in front. \\"present lavatory installation practices and recommended standards, however, preclude such a posture.... The heights used at present are so low as to be ideal only for small children.\\" Our current bathtubs are even worse. Kira said: It is probably fair to say that the only substantive reason for taking a tub bath (other than pure personal idiosyncrasy) is to 'relax\\", and yet it is precisely this that the vast majority of tubs have not permitted the user to do, particularly in the U.S.\\" They are too short, they are not comfortable, there are insufficient grab bars that make them dangerous. The single worst thing you can do from a safety point of view is have a sunken tub, where all of your weight goes on to the foot in the tub. If anything, the tub should be raised. Then there is the idiotic and standard combination tub and shower. Almost without exception, the controls are located directly under the water source and in most cases where a tub is used as a shower receptor, at a height so low as to be usable only from a sitting not from a standing position.\\" Making adjustments in the water temperature then \\"becomes an extremely hazardous undertaking.\\" Accidents occur through scalding or through movements to avoid the stream of water. And of course the shower head is on the wall, aiming down, when the stuff in most need of cleaning is at our bottoms, our genital, anal and urinary bits. Kira complains: \\"Of all the normal body cleansing activities these are undoubtedly the least understood the least discussed, and the least performed.\\" A properly designed tub and shower unit should have an adjustable shower head that varies according to height, and a hand shower to deal with the bottom bits. It should be shaped like a lounge chair. Grab bars should run continuously. It should have a seat for foot washing. And showers? Kira told Time Magazine: Showers are too small; they should be larger, have a built-in seat, and be enclosed to the ceiling except for the entrance. Different-shaped handles, square for hot and round for cold, would permit the soapy-eyed bather to adjust water temperature without alternately scalding or freezing himself. To avoid slipping while balancing on one leg, a continuous wraparound safety bar is needed. \\"One can get a car washed automatically in five minutes, while it still takes us 15 minutes to wash ourselves by hand,\\" Kira notes wryly, and predicts that sweeping technological changes are due in personal hygiene. Finally, the biggest problem of all: the toilet. Kira called it \\"the most ill-suited fixture ever designed.\\" The real issue here is that our bodies were not designed to sit on toilets, we were designed to squat. Daniel Lametti explained in Slate: People can control their defecation, to some extent, by contracting or releasing the anal sphincter. But that muscle can't maintain continence on its own. The body also relies on a bend between the rectum--where feces builds up--and the anus--where feces comes out. When we're standing up, the extent of this bend, called the anorectal angle, is about 90 degrees, which puts upward pressure on the rectum and keeps feces inside. In a squatting posture, the bend straightens out, like a kink ringed out of a garden hose, and defecation becomes easier. Kira studied our bottoms and determined where the stuff comes out and where our bodies can provide the best support without pressing our cheeks together, making things even harder to get out. Proponents of squat toilets make all kinds of claims for their benefits, according to Slate: Modern-day squat evangelists make money off the claim that a \\"more natural\\" posture wards off all sorts of health problems, from Crohn's disease to colon cancer. Image credit Relfe.com where you can read some of the wilder claims about squatting vs sitting. But studies do show that it almost eliminates hemorrhoids, that bowel movements take half as long, and that evacuations are more complete. Kira's design is a compromise, lowering the toilet to nine inches off the floor and letting the user sit, almost but not quite in a squat. It also has a built-in bidet spray, to properly clean our bottom; toilet paper doesn't do it. Kira reported on an English study that found that 44% of the population had dirty underwear. Kira liked to quote the author of the study: Many are prepared to complain about a \\"tomato sauce stain on a restaurant tablecloth, whilst they luxuriate on a plush seat in their faecially stained pants.\\" And what is the trend in toilets in America? Because of the obesity crisis, a large proportion of the population has trouble getting themselves on and off a standard 14\\" high toilet. So now they are buying toilets at the \\"comfort height\\"- 17\\" high. Instead of getting lower, they are getting higher. 50 years ago Alexander Kira was a voice in the wilderness, and we still have learned almost nothing from him.

This fact is not disputable, but also not all that laudable. The bathroom was at the Field Museum in Chicago, and the large plaque hanging outside the entrance gave it that particular title. The plaque was the result of its winning the 2011 edition of the America’s Best Restroom contest, a nationwide search for, well, you get it. The contest was developed by Cintas, a company that “designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom cleaning and supplies, tile and carpet cleaning, promotional products, first aid, safety, fire protection products and services for businesses.” The contest is an attempt to link Cintas with quality hygienic products, and has been taking place for the past 13 years. Ever relieved yourself in the bathroom inside University of Notre Dame’s main building? Then you did so in—or, into—the contest’s first winner. Throughout the year, survey manager Danny Rubin sifts through the mountain of nominees, some emailed in, some scouted personally. “We look for articles about restrooms, sometimes go on Yelp or Pinterest,” Rubin says. From there, he trims the nominations to a final 10. “You know it when you see it,” he says. “That goes for bathrooms and everything else in life.” Then, it’s left up to online voters to decide the ultimate winner. (In case you’re interested in weighing in, voting closes on Halloween.) We are a nation of skid marks. Bidets would, hopefully, solve our long, national nightmare. This year’s nominees include an outdoor shopping mall in Los Angeles, two different tiki bars, a bathroom on a hiking trail outside of Austin, and an American Girl store in Chicago. The winning establishment gets a modest press conference, the aforementioned plaque, and a theoretical rise in foot traffic from those looking to utilize the renowned facilities. “It can often be a marketing case for your establishment,” Rubin says. “They come to visit because they just have to see the bathroom.” It remains to be seen how janitors feel about this award. There is not one specific quality linking the winners, or even the nominees. Notre Dame’s winning bathroom has tile floors imported from England. The Field Museum’s is spacious and well-lit, with elegant curves of modern architecture. Chicago’s American Girl bathroom has custom-made “doll holders” in each stall, so you can avoid soiling your new purchase. But the one thing they all have in common: Despite being aesthetically pleasing, they’re designed terribly. And that’s because nearly all of America’s restrooms are wrong. IN 1976, CORNELL UNIVERSITY professor of architecture Alexander Kira published The Bathroom, a treatise on the history and state of bathroom construction. “All the world’s religions, in all their branchings and shadings, have had viewpoints and teachings on the body, sex, birth, death, illness, menstruation, elimination, and cleansing,” he wrote in the introduction. All these factors have contributed, and continue to contribute, he argued, to what we’ve come to know as “the bathroom.” At their core, bathrooms—throughout history—have needed to contain only two things: “A container for holding water for washing and a container for holding body wastes, which were ultimately disposed of in one of two ways—by return to the soil or by washing away with water.” In the case of castles this meant constructing pipes to transport the waste outside the walls, generally into the surrounding moat. (As Kira points out, swimming through moats was a much more heroic act in reality than movies make it out to be.) So while restrooms can be gussied up with any number of design flourishes, there are three key elements that must exist: The sink, a shower-bathtub, and the toilet. We’ll start with the most important. The toilet, according to Kira, is “the most ill-suited fixture ever designed.” Why? Mostly because of how we sit. Despite what certain videos—generally emanating from within Germany’s borders—would have you believe, there are basically two ways for humans to defecate: The “hunched-over” pose, with two feet firmly planted on the ground, body bent forward, and the “squat” method, wherein the knees are up near the armpits, the buttocks at the same level as the feet. (The latter, mind you, should not be confused with the hovering-over-the-toilet-seat pose of the same name, the one utilized in gross toilet situations.) Our toilets have been designed with the former position in mind, and therefore it is the norm. Unfortunately, that style has negative implications for what’s going on inside our bodies during defecation, specifically our sphincter’s alignment with the receptacle into which the goods are being delivered. (To get a sense of what hunching does, imagine a garden hose, then imagine a kink.) The stats bear this out. According to a 2003 study in Digestive Diseases and Sciences, defecators using the hunched-over posture take an average of 130 seconds to move their bowels. Squatters only take 51 seconds. In other words: We’re pooping all wrong. And the toilets are to blame. While certain items can be purchased to fix to this failure of design—there’s a line of “toilet steps” that can be placed at your feet to allow for more proper positioning—that’s like buying a huge magnifying glass for the TV. Maybe we should design a bigger set, instead. As far as the failure of sink design goes, all one needs to do is leave your home sink uncleaned for, say, a few weeks. For a tool that has the sole job of cleaning and then getting rid of the soiled water, it sure allows unwanted gunk to build up easily. It doesn’t have to be that way. Kira’s update of the sink calls for an arching spout—similar to a water fountain—that projects from a deeper back end toward a closer, shallow end, with a hump carved on the surface between them. The spout allows for easy hair-washing, while the hump gives the water a curved landed pad that diverts it into cascading streams that flow directly into the drain, keeping the basin clear of gunk. Kira’s design also calls for the sink to be set higher than we’re used to in order to allow users to stand straight rather than hunching down to the lowest common height. Know how men’s public restrooms have urinals of differing heights? That’s not only for reasons of hilarity when a man loses a round of musical urinals. It’s also a blueprint for how sinks should be designed. The shower/bath portion, meanwhile, has no place in the current state of American restrooms. Beyond the cold blocks of industrialized concrete that make up the showering facilities of public pools, group bathing has virtually no place in our culture anymore. But it’s worth pointing out that this is a relatively new phenomenon. Bathing was a public enterprise in Roman days, then it shifted to neighborhood or apartment building-style baths, until ultimately turning into the one-person or one-family private facility that is the norm in First World countries. As Kira notes, that shift was entirely based on the availability of water, which is to say the availability of money. Currently, both currencies are quite precarious, making a return to public bathing more an inevitability than a possibility. But perhaps the biggest problem with America’s restrooms is not the poor design of the items within, but the key item that’s missing. USE A BATHROOM OVERSEAS, and you’ll generally come across an odd-looking second toilet-ish thing that looks not unlike a stretched urinal. That, my friends, is a bidet. And they’ve never caught on in America. Why not? According to New York University professor Harvey Molotch, it has something to do with how Americans were first exposed to the invention. They were developed by French inventors in the 18th century, which lent them an air of “hedonism and sensuality” that didn’t jive with American Puritanical sensibilities during that era. Later on, they were hit with another negative bout of publicity when World War II soldiers returned home telling tales of water-based contraptions that were used to wash one’s genitals after a night in a brothel. “Three out of four Parisian prostitutes agree,” isn’t a particularly deft advertisement. But there are two significant reasons bidets should re-enter our bathroom conversation. Despite the fact they seem to waste water, bidets actually use less of it than toilet paper. According to Lloyd Alter at TreeHugger, the creation of one roll of toilet paper actually demands 37 gallons of water (in addition to 1.5 pounds of wood and 1.3Kwh of electricity). One roll, in this case, is 500 sheets of two-ply. Seeing as the average consumer uses 8.6 sheets per trip, in all that’s 37 gallons over 58 trips. Bidets only use about one-eighth of a gallon per use, or 37 gallons for 296 trips. But despite the country’s worrisome drought, that factor actually gets second billing. The bidet’s most important feature is its highly effective posterior cleansing. As Kira liked to continually mention, an old study in Britain found that 44 percent of the population walked around with dirty underwear. “Many are prepared to complain about a tomato sauce stain on a restaurant tablecloth, whilst they luxuriate on a plush seat in their faecially stained pants,” Kira wrote. We are a nation of skid marks. Bidets would, hopefully, solve our long, national nightmare. And yet throughout the list of nominees for America’s Best Restroom, there’s not a bidet in sight. This oversight, along with all the other general failures of American bathroom design, makes the contest nothing more than a “best of the worst.” Until the country shifts its bathroom philosophy and places the eradication of “faecially stained pants” on a higher level of importance than “a doll holder for every stall,” that fact will remain so. ||||| Output:","response":"Cornell University Professor of Architecture, Alexander Kira, addressed the problems he found with bathrooms in the 1960s, specifically regarding toilets, sinks, and bathtubs.

Given the context: What does Casey need to do before this? The answer is:","response":"Before Casey can utilize Austin's procedure as an excuse to take two weeks off work, there are several essential steps and actions he may need to undertake. 1. Understand Austin's Procedure: Obviously, before using Austin's procedure as a reason for a leave, Casey must first familiarize himself with what it involves entirely. Is it a medical procedure or a legal process? Is it something complex that requires a long recovery or preparation time? Understanding the procedure will provide him with a plausible explanation to give to his employer. 2. Assess Time Requirement: Casey must assess realistically how much time the procedure would actually require. This would include not only the time taken for the procedure itself but also any preliminary and follow-up phases involved. He must ensure that the two weeks he is planning to take off aligns with the actual time commitments the procedure requires. 3. Communication with Austin: Therefore, it's crucial for Casey to communicate with Austin. This could involve discussing his circumstances, understanding the timing and impact of the procedure, and asking about the possible consequences of taking an extended leave time off work. 4. Medical Consultation: If Austin's procedure is a medical one, a consultation with a healthcare professional is necessary. Casey should discuss with his healthcare provider about the procedure, acquire all necessary medical advice, secure any required appointments, and get a proper medical certificate attesting to his need for leave because of the procedure. 5. Formal Leave Application: Once certain about the time requirements, Casey should then formally apply for his leave of absence from work. This application should include all relevant details such as the reason for the leave (i.e., Austin's procedure), the length of the leave, and any supporting documentation required (like a doctor's certificate, legal paperwork, etc.). 6. Prepare for Procedure: Casey should make all necessary preparations for the procedure. This could be preparing himself physically, mentally, or allocating resources or making necessary arrangements for Austin's procedure and post-procedure recovery period. 7. Inform Key Parties: Before taking off, it is also fundamental that Casey informs anyone who will be directly affected by his absence. These could be colleagues who might need to take on extra work, or clients who may need to adjust their expectations during his leave. Clear communication can prevent possible complications or misunderstandings during his time off. 8. Arrange for Coverage: If Casey's work involves daily tasks that need coverage, it is crucial to make arrangements in advance so his duties are not neglected in his absence. Handing over duties or preparing a detailed work plan for whoever will cover him during these two weeks can help keep his work on track while he is away. 9. Prepare for Return: Lastly, depending on the type of his work, Casey might also need to prepare for his return to work. He should ensure that any tasks due on his return are either completed in advance or properly handed over to others. If Austin's procedure might have an impact on his performance initially, communicating this beforehand will help manage expectations on his return. Following these steps ensures a smooth transition both during the leave and upon his return, minimizing any potential disruption to his work."},{"question":"Earlier today I tried a simple form for 10 minutes : sit straight up , close your eyes , and pay close attention to every breath .

Shelowitz quizzed passengers on their pet peeves and made the top 10 into pretty humorous posters in the style of the transit authority's own, Gawker reports. He's been plastering them throughout the system this week. \\"Nail Clipping,\\" is the theme of one poster. \\"Under no circumstance is the subway the right place for this. The sound is incredibly annoying and the little nail bits go flying all over the place. Keep it at home, please. It's crazy that this even had to be mentioned.\\" Have a look at the full set of posters here. Expand this summary.","response":"Jason Shelowitz, a contemporary artist, has embarked on a mission to teach New York City subway riders about manners and etiquette with a touch of humor. Drawing inspiration from the 20th-century American author and etiquette expert, Emily Post, Shelowitz seeks to address issues such as groping, sneezing, preaching, and littering in the subway system. To understand the most common complaints of subway passengers, Shelowitz conducted a survey to identify their top pet peeves. Based on the responses, he then created ten visually engaging and amusing posters that serve as a guide to better behavior on the subway. The posters are designed to mimic the style of the New York City Transit Authority's official public service announcements, making them both familiar and accessible to riders. Throughout this week, Shelowitz has been putting up these posters across various subway stations, attempting to create awareness and spark conversations about appropriate conduct while traveling on public transportation. One of the posters addresses the issue of nail clipping, stating that it is not only annoying but also unsanitary when nail bits are left scattered around the subway. It reminds passengers that such personal grooming acts should be reserved for the privacy of their homes. Other posters in the series tackle issues such as loud music, eating, and taking up excessive space. Through these creative and sometimes tongue-in-cheek reminders, Shelowitz hopes to promote a more pleasant and considerate atmosphere for all subway riders. By addressing these common irritants in a light-hearted manner, the artist aims to emphasize the importance of being mindful and respectful of fellow passengers while commuting in a densely populated city like New York. To view the full set of posters and get a glimpse of Shelowitz's unique approach to promoting better subway etiquette, interested individuals can follow this link. While change may not happen overnight, initiatives like this can serve as a powerful reminder that even small acts of consideration can contribute to a more harmonious and enjoyable experience for everyone using public transportation."},{"question":"Translate to French: Maintaining a space for domestic cultural products Members, recognizing that the maintenance of a cultural space for national products is a necessary condition for preserving cultural diversity at the international level may, when they deem appropriate, adopt measures conducive to guaranteeing such a space, including language and/or content requirements, where applicable.","response":"1.

Quinn was replaced as lead singer by Dolores O'Riordan in 1990. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk, and pop rock elements. The Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album A new acoustic Cranberries album titled Something Else was released on 28 April 2017, through BMG. Something Else featured orchestral arrangements of prior releases, and three new songs. With the release of the new album, the group announced a tour which was to include dates in Europe, parts of the UK, and North America. The shows were scheduled in smaller venues, with live orchestral accompaniment. However, in May 2017, shortly into the European tour, The Cranberries had to cancel the remainder of the European dates due to O'Riordan's health, with the band's website citing \\"medical reasons associated with a back problem\\". The North American tour dates were cancelled in July when her recovery had not progressed enough for her to participate. On 15 January 2018, O'Riordan died unexpectedly in London, England.

There are few, if any, drawbacks to feeling happy and now a new study has shown that a positive state of mind can boost our brain power. Researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices complete with football tables, slides and crazy golf are a waste of time, or whether they boost productivity. The scientists discovered that happy people outperformed their stressed counterparts and were more-efficient employees. Happiness makes you smarter: A new study claims that happy employees outperform unhappy ones and make better software developers (illustrated) in particular. It is well known that good moods can be contagious, but researchers now think that happiness can even spread through the world wide web. American researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts. Researchers, from the University of California analysed more than a billion Facebook status updates, among more than 100 million users, and found that positive statements generated similar messages among friends. And they found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, examined posts by people in cities where it was raining - known to increase the number of negative posts and reduce the number of positive ones - and the impact this had on the status updates of people in cities where it was not raining. To make sure there was no ‘topic contagion’ all weather-related status updates were removed from the analysis. Each additional positive post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts. A number of modern workplaces now offer staff fun things to do during their lunchbreak. Google was among the first large firm to incorporate games tables and fun distractions into its offices. While the company has gone from strength to strength, researchers have wondered if the firm’s 'work hard play hard' work ethic has been part of its success. ‘For more than 30 years, it has been claimed that a way to improve software developers’ productivity and software quality is to focus on people and to provide incentives to make developers satisfied and happy. This claim has rarely been verified in software engineering research,’ the study says. Now a team of researchers from the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano in Italy have proved that Google’s strategy is a good one, after collecting data from 42 computer scientists at the university. They tested students to investigate how their emotions and moods affected their programming abilities as well as their creativity and problem solving, IT World reported. ‘Among the many skills required for. software development, developers must possess high analytical. problem-solving skills and creativity for the software construction. process,’ the study says. After. measuring the emotional states of the students using what psychologists. call the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience Affect Balance. (SPANE-B), they tested the creativity of each participant by. asking them to write captions for photographs, which were scored by a. panel of judges. Researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices, exemplified by Google (pictured) which come complete with football tables, slides and crazy golf are a waste of time, or whether they boost productivity. They found that happy software developers write better code. They were then asked to play a game to investigate their problem solving skills and the time they took to solve the puzzle provided a score on their analytical capabilities. They failed to show that happiness boosted creativity, but they did find that happy software developers were better at problem solving – a skill highly-prized by businesses such as Google. ‘The empirical data supported a difference in the analytical problem-solving skills of software developers regarding their affective states,’ the study says. ‘More specifically, the results suggest that the happiest software developers are more productive in analytical problem solving performance.’ So it seems that it is worth tech companies investing in fun activities for coders at work. After measuring the emotional states of the students in the experiment, they were asked to play a game (pictured) to investigate their problem solving skills and the time they took to solve the puzzle provided a score on their analytical capabilities.

Given the question \\"What will Casey want to do next?\\", is \\"walk away from Lee\\" a valid answer?","response":"Yes, \\"walk away from Lee\\" can be a valid answer to the question \\"What will Casey want to do next?\\" if the scenario proves to be quite overwhelming or uncomfortable for Casey. Human behaviors and reactions often depend upon a multitude of factors including but not limited to: personality traits, relationship dynamics, contextual factors, and individual's current emotional state. In the context given, if Casey is being probed with a continuous reel of questions by Lee, it could potentially induce feelings of annoyance, confusion, or anger. Negative emotions may influence Casey to distance herself from the situation or the person causing such feelings, in this case, Lee. This kind of coping strategy is often referred to as an 'avoidance strategy' used when someone tries to remove or evade a stress source. However, the details offered aren't definitive and don't necessarily guarantee Casey's next action. Her response could also depend on her relationship with Lee, her emotional resilience, and her communication skills. If Casey is comfortable with the dynamics of her relationship with Lee, she might also choose to express her discomfort or ask him to limit his questions. Alternatively, she could change the subject, try to answer in short, unencouraging responses, or even attempt to turn the tables by questioning Lee in return. For instance, if Casey is a patient and polite person who doesn't like confronting people, she might prefer to tolerate the situation instead of walking away. If she values her relationship with Lee, she might not want to offend him by leaving or reacting negatively. Considering this, while \\"walk away from Lee\\" is a possible solution, it's not the only plausible one, as human behavior is complex and greatly shaped by internal and external factors."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Leave it as is.

Question: Who has adapted and changed languages? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.

The company built a hotel in Eskisehir in Turkey and a paper factory in Kazakhstan . In Eskisehir , the company built a hotel in Turkey and a paper mill in Kazakhstan . Select from: -no. -yes.","response":"No, these two sentences do not mean exactly the same. While they convey broadly similar information, there is a slight difference in terms of precision and sentence structure. Sentence 1: The company built a hotel in Eskisehir in Turkey and a paper factory in Kazakhstan. In this sentence, it is clear that the company has built two different properties: a hotel in Eskisehir, a city located in Turkey, and a paper factory in the country of Kazakhstan. The focus here is on the fact that the company built these two properties in two different countries, with Eskisehir being mentioned to specify the location of the hotel within Turkey. Sentence 2: In Eskisehir, the company built a hotel in Turkey and a paper mill in Kazakhstan. This sentence structure implies that the main subject is the city of Eskisehir and there might be a possibility of mistakenly pointing out that both the hotel and paper mill were built in the context of Eskisehir. However, it still conveys that the company built a hotel in Turkey and a paper mill in Kazakhstan, but the emphasis is not as clear as in the first sentence. Additionally, the second sentence uses the term \\"paper mill\\" instead of \\"paper factory,\\" which might indicate a slight difference in the type or function of the facility, though generally, both terms can be used interchangeably.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"We cannot definitively conclude that \\"The workers earned overtime for their night work\\" based on the given sentence: \\"Construction equipment and workers completing a task at night.\\" Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The statement \\"Construction equipment and workers completing a task at night\\" informs us that a task was done at night by workers and construction equipment. However, it does not provide information about the workers' pay or work schedule. 2. The concept of \\"overtime\\" implies that the workers receive additional payment for working more hours than their standard work schedule. This information is not mentioned in the given sentence. 3.

This sentence has a passive structure, with the subject \\"the music\\" followed by the passive verb \\"was written.\\" The responsible agent for the action is mentioned using the preposition \\"by\\" followed by the person's name \\"Mariamma Philip.\\" Then, without repeating the verb, the sentence continues with the second subject \\"the lyrics\\" followed by the person responsible for that second action \\"Darsan Raman\\" and finally the verb \\"composed.\\" It is worth noting that it would be more natural to place the verb \\"composed\\" before \\"by Darsan Raman\\" in this sentence, making it \\"the music was written by Mariamma Philip and the lyrics composed by Darsan Raman.\\" In the second sentence: 2. The music was written by Mariamma Philip and lyrics was composed by Darsan Raman. This sentence also has a passive structure and describes the same actions and responsible agents as the first sentence. However, this time the passive verb \\"was composed\\" follows the second subject \\"lyrics.\\" Furthermore, the definite article \\"the\\" is missing before \\"lyrics,\\" but its absence does not significantly impact the meaning.

The term 'Bantoid' was first used by Krause in 1895 for languages that showed resemblances in vocabulary to Bantu. Greenberg in his 1963 \\"The Languages of Africa\\" defined Bantoid as the group to which (Narrow) Bantu belongs together with its closest relatives; this is the sense in which the term is still used today. The Bantoid languages probably do not actually form a coherent group. - The NigerCongo languages constitute one of the world's major language families, and Africa's largest in terms of geographical area, number of speakers, and number of distinct languages. They may constitute the world's largest language family in terms of distinct languages, although this question is complicated by ambiguity about what constitutes a distinct language. - Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. - Central Africa is a core region of the African continent which includes Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda. Middle Africa (as used by the United Nations when categorising geographic subregions) is an analogous term that includes Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and São Tomé and Príncipe. All of the states in the UN subregion of Middle Africa, plus those otherwise commonly reckoned in Central Africa (11 states in total), constitute the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Since its independence in 2011, South Sudan has also been commonly included in the region. - In linguistics, mutual intelligibility is a relationship between languages or dialects in which speakers of different but related varieties can readily understand each other without prior familiarity or special effort. It is generally used as the most important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although sociolinguistic factors are often also used. - The Mbam languages are a group of erstwhile zone - A Bantu languages which some lexicostatistical studies suggest are not actually Bantu , but related Southern Bantoid languages . Janssens ( 1992 -- 93 ) posits that they are all of Guthrie 's zone A.60 languages , half of his A.40 languages , and perhaps Bube ( A.31 ) . Blench ( 2011 ) includes Jarawan in A.60 , and keeps both in Bantu . Sanaga ( A60 ) : Tuki ( Bacenga ) , Leti West Mbam ( A40 ) : Bati ( A60 ) , Nomaande ( Mandi ) -- Tunen ( Aling'a , Banen ) -- Tuotomb -- Yambeta , Nyokon Yambasa ( A60 ) : Nubaca , Mbule , Nugunu , Elip -- Mmaala -- Yangben Jarawan ( See ) ? Bube ( A31 ) - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). - Ethnologue: Languages of the World is a web-based publication that contains statistics for 7,457 languages in its 19th edition, which was released in 2016. Of these, 7,097 are listed as living and 360 are listed as extinct. \\"Ethnologue\\" provides information on the number of speakers, location, dialects, linguistic affiliations, availability of the Bible in each language and dialect described, and an estimate of language viability using the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS). The publication is well respected and widely used by linguists. - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From a political perspective the region is said to be unipolar with South Africa as a first regional power.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"To accomplish the goal of sanitizing dirty shoes, there are several methods one can consider. Ultimately, the best method depends on a variety of factors such as the type of shoes, material, level of dirtiness, and the desired level of sanitation. Below are four effective methods of sanitizing dirty shoes, along with the pros and cons of each method. 1. Handwashing with soap and water: Pros: - Simple and cost-effective - Can be done at home without any special equipment - Suitable for various types of shoes and materials Cons: - Can be time-consuming, especially for heavily soiled shoes - Not the most effective method for removing all germs - May lead to water damage and discoloration on some shoe materials (e.g., leather, delicate fabrics) 2. Washing in a washing machine: Pros: - Time-efficient, as the machine does most of the work - Can effectively remove dirt and some germs from shoes - Suitable for most casual shoes and sneakers Cons: - Not suitable for shoes made from delicate materials (e.g., leather, suede) or those with glued parts - The machine's agitation can cause physical damage or wear to some shoes - Reduced effectiveness on deep-set stains or significant amounts of mud 3. Using UV light technology: Pros: - Effectively kills bacteria, viruses, and other germs without using water or harmful chemicals - Carefully designed UV shoe sanitizers can be bought online or in retail stores - Suitable for various shoe types and materials, including delicate and non-washable materials Cons: - Generally more expensive compared to other methods - Does not physically remove dirt, dust, or mud from shoes - Requires access to electricity 4. Steam cleaning: Pros: - Can be a highly effective way to sanitize and clean shoes using just water - Effective on various types of shoes, works on most materials - Penetrates deep into the fabric, potentially removing deep-set dirt and stains Cons: - Requires a steam cleaner, which can be an expensive investment - Not suitable for shoes made from materials that can be damaged by high heat or moisture (e.g., leather, some delicate fabrics) - May not be as efficient in removing large amounts of mud or debris In summary, the most appropriate sanitation method for dirty shoes depends on a variety of factors. For shoes made from sturdy materials and without delicate parts, washing in a washing machine is a quick and effective option. Handwashing with soap and water can be an alternative for those who prefer a more gentle approach. UV light technology provides an ideal solution for sanitizing shoes without damage or water, while steam cleaning can deep clean and sanitize shoes using hot steam. Consider these factors and choose the method that makes the most sense for your specific shoes and requirements."},{"question":"The air exploded in a flash of bone and steel and blood.

Most coin dealers start as collectors because it's a great way to learn about different types of coins, how to recognize valuable coins, and learn the ins and outs of the coin industry. You can collect coins from a lot of different sources. OPTIONS: 1. Coin dealers will have coins of varying prices that can help you build your collection. You can also get coins from internet dealers, which are great if you're looking for a specific coin.. 2. Globe and atm coins are most frequently stolen from banks at little less than 150. If you find yourself drawn into a coin collecting scam, don't hesitate to bring your bank card or two to the bank.. 3. Target coin collectors by visiting coin-dealers website and clicking on the \\" name \\" tab. Enter your country of origin and visit the issuing website to click on the \\" talk \\" button.. 4. There is more than one coin market, so individual coin sellers are more likely to be willing to do business with collectors. It may be difficult to find coins in used coin markets or if antiques aren't the same..","response":"5. Attend coin shows and auctions. Coin shows allow collectors and dealers to come together in one location. They are often held in convention centers or similar facilities and are organized by professional associations or clubs dedicated to the hobby. Attend coin shows to meet other collectors and dealers, learn about pricing and grading, and see a wide variety of coins in person. Auctions are another great place to find coins and, if you're lucky, acquire some valuable pieces at a reasonable cost. Research upcoming auctions, familiarize yourself with the items up for sale, and don't be afraid to engage with other participants to gain knowledge and potentially make connections in the coin dealer world. 6. Learn about coin grading and certification. Understanding the condition of a coin is essential to its value. Coins are graded on a scale from 1 to 70, with 70 being in perfect condition (also called \\"mint state\\"). Familiarize yourself with the grading system and the criteria used to determine a coin's grade. In addition, consider obtaining professional certification from a reputable coin grading service like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) or NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) to ensure you can accurately determine the value of the coins you encounter. 7. Develop relationships within the industry. As with many industries, networking is key to your success as a coin dealer. Develop relationships with other dealers, coin collectors, and members of organizations like the ANA (American Numismatic Association) or other local coin clubs. These connections can help you learn more about the industry, stay up-to-date on trends, and ultimately make more informed decisions when buying or selling coins. 8. Decide on a specialization or niche. While some coin dealers may deal with a broad range of coins, others may focus on specific niches such as ancient coins, U.S. coins, or particular types of currency. By specializing in a particular area, you can develop a deeper expertise in that area and potentially corner the market for that segment. 9. Establish your business and online presence. As you transition from a collector to a dealer, consider setting up a business entity (such as a limited liability company or corporation) to protect your personal assets and formalize your coin dealing activities. Build a professional website detailing your services, inventory, and expertise. This will help potential customers and fellow dealers find you and establish a sense of credibility. Additionally, consider setting up social media profiles to engage with other collectors, dealers, and enthusiasts. 10. Buy and sell coins profitably. With your knowledge of coins, grading, and the market, carefully select coins for your inventory and sell them at a profit. You may start by buying coins at a lower grade, improving their condition through cleaning or conservation, and then selling them at a higher grade or price. As your reputation grows, you may also be approached by other collectors wishing to sell their coins through you on a consignment basis, which can further expand your inventory and boost your income. In conclusion, becoming a successful coin dealer requires extensive knowledge of coins, grading and certification systems, and a solid network within the industry. Additionally, specialization and a strong business presence can help set you apart from your competitors.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally placed in the order Galliformes. Old World quail are placed in the family Phasianidae, and New World quail are placed in the family Odontophoridae. The species of buttonquail are named for their superficial resemblance to quail, and form the family Turnicidae in the order Charadriiformes. The king quail, an Old World quail, often is sold in the pet trade, and within this trade is commonly, though mistakenly, referred to as a \\"button quail\\". Many of the common larger species are farm-raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they may be released to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas outside their natural range. In 2007, 40 million quail were produced in the U.S. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest. - The Galliformes are an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, chicken, New World quail and Old World quail, ptarmigan, partridge, pheasant, junglefowl and the Cracidae. The name derives from \\"gallus\\", Latin for \\"cock\\" or \\"rooster\\". Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. \\"Wildfowl\\" or just \\"fowl\\" are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to waterfowl (Anseriformes), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds. This group has about 290 species, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world's continents (except for the innermost deserts and perpetual ice). They are rarer on islands, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from oceanic islandsunless introduced there by humans. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - The king quail (\\"Excalfactoria chinensis\\"), also known as the blue-breasted quail, Asian blue quail, button quail, Chinese painted quail, or Chung-Chi, is a species of Old World quail in the family Phasianidae. This species is the smallest \\"true quail\\" and is quite common in aviculture worldwide. In the wild they range from southeastern Asia to Oceania with 10 different subspecies. - Coturnix is a genus of eight extant species and two known extinct species of Old World quail . They are related to the francolins , jungle bush quail , snowcocks and rock partridges . Species of Coturnix and the aforementioned genera belong to their own monophyletic clade , Coturnicinae , a subfamily within the family Phasianidae . Some authors consider this clade , together with a sibling assemblage , the Gallininae ( including the junglefowl , long - billed partridge and Chinese bamboo partridge ) warrants classification in its own family , Coturnigallusinidae . Quail of Coturnix live in pairs or small social groups and form larger groups during migration . Not all species migrate , but most are capable of extremely rapid , upward flight to escape from danger . Unlike related genera , Old World quail do not perch in trees . They devote much of their time to scratching and foraging for seeds and invertebrates on the ground . Typical habitats are dense vegetation such as grasslands , bushes alongside rivers and cereal fields . They are predated upon heavily by the diurnal hawks . - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 16 species in two genera, with most species being found in the genus \\"Turnix\\" and only one being found in the genus \\"Ortyxelos\\". - The New World quails or Odontophoridae are small birds only distantly related to the Old World quail, but named for their similar appearance and habits. The American species are in their own family Odontophoridae, whereas Old World quail are in the pheasant family Phasianidae. The family ranges from Canada through to southern Brazil, and two species, the California quail and the bobwhite quail, have been successfully introduced to New Zealand. The stone partridge and Nahan's partridge, both found in Africa, seem to belong to the family. Species are found across a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to deserts, although few species are capable of surviving at very low temperatures. Thirty-four species are placed in ten genera. - The Phasianidae are a family of heavy, groundliving birds which includes pheasants, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the American Ornithologists' Union includes Tetraonidae (grouse), Numididae (guineafowl), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'coturnix'?

And coming into Sunday night’s home game against Seattle Sounders, the champion Galaxy were coming off two straight defeats without scoring and looking at best indifferent in the early season running. So in many ways the visit of Seattle, the team who along with LA have been the best regular season performers since 2009, could not have been timed worse – particularly with Robbie Keane missing, and their attacking hopes mainly resting on the rather less subtle charms of Alan “Snowshoes” Gordon, in his 200th MLS appearance. And as the Sounders, themselves missing Clint Dempsey, but boasting the in-form Obafemi Martins, spent the opening 20 minutes forcing LA keeper Jaime Penedo into save after acrobatic save, it looked very much as if the hosts were in danger of falling to their first home defeat to the Sounders in 10 games. Lamar Neagle in particular must have been left wondering what he had to do to score against Penedo, as the LA shot stopper, while at the other end Seattle’s midfield and defense seemed well set up to cope with the somewhat rudimentary threat of Gordon the target man. Rudimentary, but effective, that is. Just after another Penedo full-stretch parry, Gordon opened the scoring with a point-blank header. It was perhaps a fitting way for Gordon to celebrate his unlikely run to 200 appearances. He is not a man to replicate the close quarters subtlety of Keane, but as an outlet when the Galaxy need to force something, he is nothing if not forceful. In truth neither side looked at their incisive best, as what was billed as a marquee game drifted for long stretches in the late afternoon sun, with occasional surges of excitement for another save by the impressive Penedo. It was perhaps telling that one of the biggest cheers of the second-half came when the visiting David Beckham was shown on the big screen. Gordon had once welcomed Beckham to LA by holding on to his handshake a beat too long in the Englishman’s inaugural visit to his new locker room and asking, “And you are…?” It was a typical moment of irreverence from a proud journeyman who was here before the start of the designated player era and who against the odds has managed to survive and even thrive in the interim. And in game 200, he won a game between the best two teams of that era. There’ll doubtless be higher profile games between these two teams later in the year, but Gordon deserved his moment. GP Orlando City have already shown they’re capable of producing a few exemplary moments in order to grind out a fortuitous result on the road – see their 2-2 comeback draw against the Montreal Impact last month. In fact, the expansion club have yet to lose on the trot. Here too Adrian Heath’s team did what they needed to produce a 0-2 win against a Portland Timbers team that is slouching towards May (though luck and some, erm, “bold” refereeing helped things along), and in doing so revealed a few bright spots. Brek Shea in particular looks like he’s owning that left-back position, working out the skilful balance between attack and defense. Kevin Molino, despite some hesitancy here and there, was influential in the final third and produced a smart assist for Cyle Larin with a nice cross in the 30th minute. And Larin, the soon-to-be 20 year old Canadian Generation Adidas wunderkind who chested in the winner, may or may not have seen it coming but made it look intentional and was otherwise worthy of a start with a few good chances. Though Orlando were hardly dominant, they were good for the win. For Portland though this was a hot mess. Hot in the sense that despite their 1-2-3 record, they are still clearly a threat where it counts. Darlington Nagbe looked dangerous on the counter, Fanendo Adi managed six shots and was able to move well in front of goal, and Dairon Asprilla looked to have scored the equalizer in the 72nd minute until Donovan Ricketts made an incredible diving save. Nothing resulted in a Timbers goal, though, and the idea that all will be well when Diego Valeri comes back is starting to sound like something out of Waiting for Godot (or Guffman). But Portland were also a mess. Diego Chara somehow only received a yellow for tackling the last man Kevin Molino on the centre circle in the 45th minute as he was about to receive a gorgeous through pass. Then Timbers keeper Adam Kwarasey made the interesting decision to swat the legs of Carlos Rivas in the 85th minute with a point still very much in the offing for his club. Kwarasey appeared to have atoned with a world class save from Kaká from the spot, and yet Kevin Stott ordered a retake when Chara, for some reason, encroached on the area. If ever there was a mascot for 2015 Portland, it isn’t Timber Joey, but rather their morose, scarf-draped coach Caleb Porter looking on from the sidelines. RW A week after starring in a Regency drama over a discarded tissue opposite Portland’s Caleb Porter, Dallas coach Oscar Pareja found himself welcoming 19th-century villain Pablo Mastroeni and his unfeasibly waxed mustache to Toyota Stadium. Pareja must be wishing he’d stayed in the era when his team routinely won games (which going on recent seasons’ evidence we’ll call simply “March”), after his former team’s young players ended a record-equaling winless streak in emphatic fashion by blowing away Dallas in front of their own fans. As we noted last week, time seemed to be running out for Colorado’s kids to come good on their promise as they equalled a decade-old league winless streak record held by Rocky Mountain rivals Real Salt Lake, while still waiting to score their first goal of the season. And with Dallas th hosts after their blip against Portland, most neutrals would have been putting money on the Rapids holding that winless record outright after Friday’s nationally televised game. Instead, after waiting over 600 minutes for a goal, Colorado went ahead with their first of the season after just two minutes, and by the time the final whistle had blown, they’d added three more, with substitute Dillon Serna capping the display with a peach of a goal late on. It was as emphatic as it was unexpected, and in one fell swoop transformed the complexion of Colorado’s start – having kept Dallas out at the other end, the Rapids can now point to having conceded (and lost) in only one of their five games so far, and to have denied the speed and movement of a formidable looking Dallas offense in completing the latest instalment. It would have been no disgrace to concede to this Dallas attack, but having built a defensive platform Mastroeni must have at least hoped for a goal for his team to build on from this game. To score four, unanswered, is a quantum leap for his side, and you have to wonder what effect that can now have on the Rapids’ season, and indeed that of Dallas. Of course seemingly aberrant results can happen at any time in parity-obsessed MLS, but the flip side of that is that there are few easy games for confidence-starved teams to break streaks such as those Colorado have been on (it’s perhaps telling that their last win was against Chivas USA towards the end of that team’s doomed tenure in MLS). To do so against the coach who’d walked out on them must have been an additional pleasure for the Colorado players. That same coach, Pareja, won plaudits last year for the way he retooled his team after what could have been the devastating loss of Mauro Diaz early in the campaign. Compared to that challenge, lifting his team after two consecutive defeats shouldn’t be beyond Pareja, but this has been a week that’s had him reaching for the tissues. GP Why not book the Guardian MLS writing team for your next motivational speaking gig? Not only did we inspire Colorado’s kids to grow up this week, but we took Philadelphia from late game “incompetence” last time out to inspiration this weekend, as the team won their first game of the season through an injury time winner against New York City FC. Fair’s fair and credit may partly be due to the Union themselves, and in particular coach Jim Curtin and his decision to act decisively in dropping expensive goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi this week. Mbolhi had arrived last year being hailed as a coup of a signing by Union CEO Nick Sakiewicz, who had made much of Mbolhi’s appearances at the World Cup, and rather less mention of what’s been a checkered club career. Since arriving, Mbolhi has made a number of high-profile errors, including another awkward one in last week’s loss to Sporting KC, and this week Curtin had seen enough – telling the keeper to basically go home and clear his head with an indefinite timetable for his return. And as Mbolhi took the first flight to France, Curtin turned to local goalkeeper and Union supporter John McCarthy, who had been playing for Rochester Rhinos as Mbolhi appeared in Brazil, to take his place. In the event it wasn’t a complete fairy tale rise for McCarthy, who had to pick the ball out of the net in a strained second-half period for Philadelphia that saw David Villa walk an equalizer into the net, and New York City threaten to roll over their opponents. But a couple of late saves and an otherwise solid enough performance, combined with Vincent Nogueira poking home an injury-time winner at the other end, did mean that McCarthy got to walk off the field with a big hug from Curtin, and in front of home fans celebrating their first win of 2015. It was an important win for Curtin, after the gut punch of Sporting’s two injury-time goals last week, and one that added some extra spice to the return game between the two sides at Yankee Stadium this Thursday night. Certainly it shifted the emphasis of the questions asked of Jason Kreis post-game, as he lamented the late lapse in concentration that saw a long ball being allowed to bounce in the build up to Philly’s winner, but mainly expressed concern at yet another slow start from his team in a second consecutive loss. It’s clearly a preoccupying issue for the emerging New York City team. Visitors to the locker room after the match were greeted by the sight of the pre-game whiteboard emblazoned with the question, “Can we get out to a really aggressive, committed, confident start today?” They didn’t, and the second half flurry that brought the equalizer was not typical of their performance. Maybe they should book the very reasonable Guardian motivational team before Thursday night … GP It’s tempting to compare the Montreal Impact – both Concacaf Champions League finalists and the last-place team in the Eastern Conference following a 3-0 loss to the Houston Dynamo - to other sides which famously excelled in the cups whilst bumbling in the league. Wigan in 2013, able to defeat Manchester City to win the FA Cup but not to stay in the Premier League. Liverpool in 2005, winners of the European Cup and fifth-place finishers in the English top flight, the first to force Uefa to change the rules over Champions League qualifying. Yet the comparisons don’t quite stand up under scrutiny. Despite advancing over two legs in both the CCL quarters and semis against Mexican side Pachuca and Costa Rica’s Alajuelense respectively, in all four matches Frank Klopas’ counterattacking Impact only managed a single, bona fide win: a 2-0 win at the Olympic Stadium in their home semi-final. In fact, that game stands as their only victory in all eight of their eight competitive matches in 2015. The Montreal Impact, despite a historic opportunity to become the first MLS and Canadian team to win the Concacaf Champions League, are nevertheless decidedly mediocre both midweek and weekends. For now, perhaps. Despite conceding three goals to the Dynamo, Montreal were, at least for one or two spells, unmistakably dominant. Andres Romero looked sharp on the ball,­ Dilly Duka was menacing in the early going, Jack McInerney displayed brief glimpses of his old self … Montreal finished the game having outshot, out-passed and out-possessed Owen Coyle’s Dynamo. Houston might say with confidence that letting Montreal have the ball was all part of the plan (Impact defender Laurent Ciman told the press after the match he would have preferred to concede the ball and win than play beautifully and lose). Having conceded in the 15th minute of play, the Impact had no choice in the final stages but to push up and risk a drubbing, which they did courtesy of Ricardo Clark’s nifty run in the box (72nd minute) and the rookie substitute Rob Lovejoy’s wonderful hit (80th). And yet at least the elements of a team perhaps substantially better than the one which finished last overall in 2014 are there. We will get a better picture when the Impact fly to the Azteca for the first leg of the CCL final against America on 22 April.

These self-driving cars are designed to rely on advanced digital systems for sensing their environment, processing information, and making decisions to operate smoothly without requiring human input. Many major automobile manufacturers, as well as tech companies and startups, have been investing heavily in autonomous vehicle technologies with the hopes that AVs will revolutionize and improve the future of transportation. One of the pressing challenges in urban areas around the world is traffic congestion, which leads to wasted time, increased pollution, and other negative impacts on society. City planners and commuters alike are eager to find potential solutions to address this complex issue. The development and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles present a unique possibility for addressing the ongoing problem of traffic congestion in urban and metropolitan areas. Hypothesis: The Adoption of Autonomous Vehicles Will Alleviate Traffic Congestion in Urban Areas The hypothesis is that the large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles in urban environments will lead to a significant reduction in traffic congestion. This hypothesis is based on several factors: 1. Enhanced Communication: AVs can be designed to communicate with other vehicles and traffic management systems in real-time, creating a dynamic and self-regulating traffic ecosystem. This communication can optimize routes and reduce stop-start traffic patterns, which contribute to congestion. 2. Improved Driving Behavior: One of the primary causes of traffic congestion is human driving behavior, such as sudden braking, abrupt lane changes, and inefficient merging. Autonomous vehicles typically operate in a consistent and predictable fashion, which can minimize conflicts and optimize traffic flow for all vehicles on the road. 3. Adaptive Traffic Control Systems: By integrating AVs into a smart network of traffic signals and control systems, traffic flow can be continuously optimized, smoothing out busy intersections and reducing the breadth and depth of traffic jams. 4. Reduced Vehicle Ownership: By offering the convenience of self-driving taxis and ridesharing services, more individuals may be inclined to forgo vehicle ownership. This could lead to a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road, ultimately helping reduce traffic congestion. 5. Car Pooling: Autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to make carpooling more efficient and convenient. This would be particularly true for self-driving car services that optimize routes and pickup/drop-off scheduling. If carpooling becomes more popular and easier to access, fewer vehicles will be on the road, further reducing congestion. In conclusion, the hypothesis holds that the integration of autonomous vehicles into urban transportation systems will significantly alleviate traffic congestion. To verify this hypothesis, further research, analysis, and experimentation, such as conducting real-world trials with self-driving vehicles in controlled urban environments, would be necessary. In the long run, AVs have the potential to transform the way people travel and commute, offering a cleaner, safer, and more efficient transportation system."},{"question":"This is an email Jeff Skilling proposed a solution to Gov Davis to solve the supply and pricing problems in the California market.

One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell.

However, the history of the Ouija board dates back to much earlier than that. The Ouija board, also known as a \\"spirit\\" or \\"talking\\" board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0-9, the words \\"yes\\", \\"no\\", \\"hello\\", and \\"goodbye\\", and sometimes other symbols or graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called a planchette. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is believed to move across the board to spell out words or answer questions posed by the users. The mysterious movement of the planchette has often been attributed to supernatural forces or spirit communications. The concept of the Ouija board can be traced back to mid-19th century spiritualism, particularly in the United States. In the era of the Civil War, the spiritualist movement gained popularity as people sought to communicate with deceased loved ones. The precursors to the Ouija board included various devices used for automatic writing, such as planchettes with pencils attached to the tips and the dial plate, which used a spinning dial instead of a planchette. In 1890, a patent was granted to Elijah Bond, Charles Kennard, and William H. A. Maupin for a talking board on which the Ouija name was first introduced. The name \\"Ouija\\" has been claimed to be a combination of the French word \\"oui\\" and the German word \\"ja\\", both meaning \\"yes\\". However, it has also been suggested that the name came through the board itself during a session that involved the sister-in-law of Elijah Bond, who identified the board as Ouija and declared that it meant \\"good luck\\" in ancient Egyptian. The board was initially produced and marketed by the Kennard Novelty Company, and, following the company's dissolution in 1898, production and distribution of the Ouija board was taken over by William Fuld. He marketed the board under the brand name Ouija and continued to produce and sell the Ouija board until his death in 1927. After Fuld's death, his heirs continued to manufacture and market Ouija boards under the name William Fuld Talking Board Set. Finally, in 1966, the Fuld family sold the manufacturing and marketing rights for Ouija boards to Parker Brothers, the company that popularized the board game Monopoly. Parker Brothers produced and marketed Ouija boards as a family game and maintained ownership until 1991, when they were acquired by Hasbro Inc., which currently owns the rights to the Ouija board/trademark and continues to manufacture it under the same specifications and designs introduced by Parker Brothers. In summary, while the Ouija board's origins can be traced back to the mid-19th century spiritualist movement, it wasn't until 1966 that Parker Brothers began producing the well-known and widely-used version of the board that we are familiar with today."},{"question":"Premise: Wanted, the headline screeched.

The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of heat, hot water, gas, electricity, lights, water, or refrigeration service. Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure. The tenant can ask the court to issue a restraining order, file a criminal complaint against the landlord, or sue him/her for money damages and attorney's fees. Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase. If a tenant attempts to claim retaliation, but did not complain about violations until after he or she received notice from the landlord, the tenant will be found to have no valid claim.

Answer: Answer:","response":"Yes, based on the review, it appears that the user would recommend this product."},{"question":"Given the background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). and the situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. Answer the following question: Which city experienced more stress build up within the rocks? A:","response":"Red city B: Tree city C: Both experienced the same stress build-up D: Cannot be determined based on the given information Answer: D: Cannot be determined based on the given information Step 1: Consider the background information The background information states that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and stresses build up within the rocks as plates move. When the stresses become too much, the rocks break and release energy, resulting in an earthquake. The elastic rebound theory explains this process. Step 2: Analyze the situation of the two sister cities Red city and Tree city are both on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city is 10 miles away from a volcano and experiences many earthquakes, while Tree city is 60 miles away and has few earthquakes. Step 3: Identify factors affecting stress build-up within the rocks Factors that may affect stress build-up in rocks include: - The type of plate boundary - The rate of plate movement - The distance from the plate boundary - The type of rocks in the area - Local geological features Step 4: Evaluate which city experienced more stress build-up within the rocks The given information does not provide enough details about the factors affecting stress build-up within the rocks in each city. While it is mentioned that Red city experiences more earthquakes and is closer to a volcano compared to Tree city, this alone does not allow us to accurately determine which city experienced more stress build-up within the rocks."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Airey Neave, unit, Royal Artillery; Royal Artillery, garrison, Hohne; Airey Neave, battle, Battle of France; Battle of France, commander, Hugo Sperrle.

Where would a corpse be covered by a blanket? Options: - bath store - bedroom - hospital - flower garden - michigan","response":"To answer this question, we'll go through the given options and analyze each one based on their relevance to a situation involving a corpse covered by a blanket. 1. Bath store: A bath store predominantly sells bathroom-related items like towels, toiletries, and bathroom fixtures. There's no particular reason why a corpse would be covered by a blanket in this setting. Hence, this option can be ruled out. 2. Bedroom: A bedroom is a place where people typically sleep, relax and spend a considerable amount of time. It is possible that a person died during their sleep and a family member or friend might have covered the deceased person with a blanket. This scenario could suggest a possibility for a corpse being covered by a blanket. So, this option is plausible. 3. Hospital: A hospital is a place where individuals go for medical treatment or care. In some instances, people may die while receiving treatment, or their bodies may be kept in a hospital morgue temporarily after death. It's not uncommon for hospital staff to cover a deceased person's body with a sheet or blanket, out of respect and to maintain privacy. This makes the hospital a probable location where a corpse could be covered by a blanket. 4. Flower garden: A flower garden is a place where flowers and other plants are grown and displayed. It's mostly an outdoor location and not a typical setting for a corpse to be covered by a blanket. This option seems less likely. 5. Michigan: Michigan is a US state, a geographic location, and not a specific place where a corpse would be covered by a blanket. It doesn't provide enough context to link it directly to the situation in question, so we can rule out this option. Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that there are two plausible options where a corpse would be covered by a blanket: in a bedroom and in a hospital. Both of these locations involve situations where a person may have died, and covering the body with a blanket is a way of showing respect and maintaining privacy."},{"question":"Given the question: Article: In 1978, I was 18 and was working as a nurse in a small town about 270 km away from Sydney, Australia. I was looking forward to having five days off from duty. Unfortunately, the only one train a day back to my home in Sydney had already left. So I thought I'd hitch a ride . I waited by the side of the highway for three hours but no one stopped for me. Finally, a man walked over and introduced himself as Gordon. He said that although he couldn't give me a lift, I should come back to his house for lunch. He noticed me standing for hours in the November heat and thought I must be hungry. I was doubtful as a young girl but he assured(...) me I was safe, and he also offered to help me find a lift home afterwards. When we arrived at his house, he made us sandwiches. After lunch, he helped me find a lift home. Twenty-five years later, in 2003, while I was driving to a nearby town one day, I saw an elderly man standing in the glaring heat, trying to hitch a ride. I thought it was another chance to repay someone for the favor I'd been given decades earlier. I pulled over and picked him up. I made him comfortable on the back seat and offered him some water.

On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

He's a superstar. One day the public learns that the CEO killed a guy to get ahead in his career, but the CEO doesn't get convicted because his clever attorney gets him off on a technicality. Assume in this hypothetical situation that the public correctly believes the CEO killed a guy to advance his career. Should the board of directors allow the superstar CEO to keep his job? Or is killing a guy to advance your career always a firing offense?Okay, keep your answer in mind.The next question is for supporters of President Obama. Let's say your political views map closely to the President's positions. He's your guy. But suppose you found out he once killed an American citizen in the United States to help his reelection. And assume, as with the CEO example, that the facts of the killing are undisputed and the President found a legal means to avoid prosecution. In that hypothetical case, would you still vote for President Obama? Or would you say it is a firing offense for a President to kill a citizen to advance his career?I predict that every one of you favored firing the hypothetical CEO for killing a guy to get ahead. My second prediction is that every Republican reader of this blog favored firing President Obama in the hypothetical and imaginary case of him murdering a citizen to get elected. My third prediction is that supporters of President Obama will quibble with the hypothetical example, or my comparison to the CEO, or say President Obama is still a better option than Romney. In other words, for most supporters of President Obama, I don't think there is such a thing as a \\"firing offense.\\"For the record, President Obama did not technically kill anyone to get elected. That was just a hypothetical example. But he is putting an American citizen in jail for 10 years to life for operating medical marijuana dispensaries in California where it is legal under state law. And I assume the President - who has a well-documented history of extensive marijuana use in his youth - is clamping down on California dispensaries for political reasons, i.e. to get reelected. What other reason could there be?One could argue that the President is just doing his job and enforcing existing Federal laws. That's the opposite of what he said he would do before he was elected, but lying is obviously not a firing offense for politicians.Personally, I'd prefer death to spending the final decades of my life in prison. So while President Obama didn't technically kill a citizen, he is certainly ruining this fellow's life, and his family's lives, and the lives of countless other minor drug offenders. And he is doing it to advance his career. If that's not a firing offense, what the hell is?Romney is likely to continue the same drug policies as the Obama administration. But he's enough of a chameleon and a pragmatist that one can't be sure. And I'm fairly certain he'd want a second term. He might find it \\"economical\\" to use federal resources in other ways than attacking California voters. And he is vocal about promoting states' rights, so he's got political cover for ignoring dispensaries in states where medical marijuana is legal.So while I don't agree with Romney's positions on most topics, I'm endorsing him for president starting today. I think we need to set a minimum standard for presidential behavior, and jailing American citizens for political gain simply has to be a firing offense no matter how awesome you might be in other ways.: Congratulations to Politico for being the first to take this post out of context.

A key factor in his decision, wrote cartoonist Scott Adams, is what he described as President Barack Obama’s role in a ruling in federal court to send to prison a California man who operates a medical marijuana dispensary, with a sentence between 10 years and life. Text Size - + reset “And I assume the President — who has a well-documented history of extensive marijuana use in his youth — is clamping down on California dispensaries for political reasons, i.e. to get reelected,” Adams wrote, pinning blame for the man’s arrest on Obama. “What other reason could there be?” “Personally, I’d prefer death to spending the final decades of my life in prison,” Adams continued. “So while President Obama didn’t technically kill a citizen, he is certainly ruining this fellow’s life, and his family’s lives, and the lives of countless other minor drug offenders. And he is doing it to advance his career. If that’s not a firing offense, what the hell is?” Adams, who said that he disagrees with Romney on “most topics,” said “one can’t be sure” where Romney would stand on the subject — so he offered up his endorsement of the GOP nominee. “Romney is likely to continue the same drug policies as the Obama administration,” he wrote. “But he’s enough of a chameleon and a pragmatist that one can’t be sure. And I’m fairly certain he’d want a second term. He might find it “economical” to use federal resources in other ways than attacking California voters.

Rancho Cucamonga resident Aaron Sandusky was convicted in a federal court Friday of two marijuana-related counts. The first is conspiracy to manufacture marijuana plants and maintain a drug-involved premises. The second count is possession of marijuana plants with intent to distribute -- which essentially means he was running a pot shop, notes LA Weekly. On each count, the jury found that Sandusky had worked with at least 1,000 marijuana plants. Sandusky, 41, faces a minimum of 10 years to life in prison. He was taken into custody after the trial and the sentencing hearing is scheduled for Jan. 2013. The charges stem from Sandusky's three medical marijuana collectives, known as \\"G3 Holisitic,\\" in the Inland Empire cities of Upland, Colton and Moreno Valley. The U.S. attorney's office had sent Sandusky letters in Oct. 2011 warning him that the stores were violating federal law, and in response Sandusky closed two of them. The next month, federal agents raided the remaining store, in Upland, twice. They seized marijuana plants and 11,500 in cash, effectively wiping out Sandusky's entire business. The conviction at the federal court level is a blow to the medical marijuana community in California, some of whom have been supporting Sandusky through a website raising money for his legal defense. His case also underscores the contrast between California -- which recognizes the medicinal properties of pot and protects marijuana dispensaries -- and federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal controlled substance with no accepted medical use. Federalism issues didn't come into play during the trial, which Zach Weissmueller, a writer for libertarian magazine Reason, believes weakened Sandusky's case. In a blog for Reason, Weissmueller writes: The federal government was successful in quelling any discussion of medical marijuana laws, federalism, or jury nullification--all of which were specters looming over the case when they discussed it in open court while jurors were not present. In closing statements, the federal prosecutors were sure to emphasize to jurors that personal feelings, political beliefs, and morals do not matter. The law is the law. One prosecutor instructed the jury \\"not to debate the law, but to apply the law.\\" If there was one important takeaway from the prosecution's closing, it was this phrase, emblazoned on one of their presentational slides: \\"Factual determination, not moral judgment.\\" Another point of contention during the trial was the fact that the judge did not allow Sandusky to claim entrapment based on President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder's public statements on medical marijuana. Throughout his first campaign, Obama had said he wouldn't use federal resources to circumvent state laws about medical marijuana. During a 2009 press conference, Holder followed up on that promise, saying that federal raids on medical marijuana dispensaries would be coming to an end unless the shops violated both state and federal law. Sandusky had been charged along with five others who worked at G3, all of whom took plea deals and avoided a trial. During the course of the trial, G3 co-founder and owner John Leslie Nuckolls II, one of the men charged, admitted to having worked for the county District Attorney's Office and the DEA, reports the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. In an August interview with ReasonTV (video above), Sandusky had called the conflict between California medical marijuana laws and federal drug laws a \\"constitutional battle\\" and vowed to defend the 10th Amendment right for states to pass their own laws. \\"If I have to go to jail for 20 years defending it, then so be it,\\" said Sandusky. \\"If a jury finds me guilty of violating federal law, then I'll go do the time.\\" ||||| Dilbert creator Scott Adams, last seen blaming society for being cruel to rapists and defending a chain email depicting President Obama as a chimpanzee, has now, appropriately enough, endorsed Mitt Romney for President. Coming, as it does, on the same day as the big Dennis Miller endorsement, it appears that Team Romney has now completely locked down the White Guys Who Laughed In 1993 demographic. While Adams’ endorsement is no surprise (other than the accompanying fact that Dilbert still exists), nor is it really news, his “logic” is worth more laughs than his comic strip ever was. First, some background. There are things called “newspapers” that are like a whole bunch of websites printed on paper, and in these newspapers are things called “comic strips.” Many of them are for kids, but there have been, like, three (The Far Side, Bloom County, Doonesbury, did I miss any?) funny ones for adults. Dilbert is one of the other kind, and it’s creator, Scott Adams, is a model citizen of entitled white male America. Like a lot of these guys, Adams gets his librul on when it comes to his own right to smoke weed or do whatever the eff he wants (aka “Libertarianism”), but gets all Republican-y when it comes time to pay for the society that protects and promotes his privileges. Thus, the premise of Adams’ endorsement is that President Obama has been too tough on medical marijuana dispensaries, but Mitt Romney will be better because he sucks so much. Or something like that. Also, the President kinda killed a guy, but not really. But he totally killed a guy: Let’s say a CEO does a great job for stockholders; he increases profits five-fold, treats the employees well, and causes the stock price to skyrocket. He’s a superstar. One day the public learns that the CEO killed a guy to get ahead in his career, but the CEO doesn’t get convicted because his clever attorney gets him off on a technicality. Assume in this hypothetical situation that the public correctly believes the CEO killed a guy to advance his career. Should the board of directors allow the superstar CEO to keep his job? Or is killing a guy to advance your career always a firing offense? Well, the President didn’t kill a guy, but he did allow federal agents to enforce federal drug laws, which is kinda the same thing. Adams reasons that President Obama should be fired for enforcing laws that people like Mitt Romney will never allow to be changed. I don’t like the President’s record on medical marijuana, but in my imaginary business, I don’t fire the guy who killed one dude so I can hire Hannibal Lecter.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When thinking about the necessities of life for humans, water is considered an essential component. The human body is made up of approximately 60% water, and it plays a vital role in various functions such as maintaining body temperature, digestion, and waste elimination. Now, we might be curious if it's possible for someone to survive without ever drinking water or consuming any fluids. We know there are some animals and organisms living in extremely dry environments that might survive without water for prolonged periods. However, the human body has specific needs, and fluids are essential for its optimal functioning. Physiologically, humans cannot go without any liquids for more than a few days. Our bodies continuously lose water through sweating, breathing, and digestion, which needs to be replenished. Without proper hydration, our organs would eventually shut down, leading to severe health consequences and eventual death. Research and anecdotal evidence have shown that people can have dire consequences even after just a few days of intense dehydration.

In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: What is the rationale behind using the term \\"youth\\" as it pertains to a particular age range or stage of life within a society? Answer: The term \\"youth\\" refers to a specific stage in a person's life that lies between childhood and adulthood, typically associated with teenagers and young adults. The rationale for using \\"youth\\" to describe this group of individuals within a society stems from various factors such as physical, psychological, and sociocultural reasons: 1. Physical development: During the youth stage, a person experiences significant growth, both physically and mentally. This includes puberty, wherein individuals undergo various physiological changes (such as the development of primary and secondary sexual characteristics) that contribute to their maturation into adulthood. 2. Psychological development: In addition to physical growth, youth is a crucial time for psychological development. This stage marks the development of identity, autonomy, and decision-making skills, as well as emotional regulation. Throughout this period, individuals start forming their sense of self and values while exploring the world around them. 3. Social and cultural expectations: Society and culture may define the concept of youth in line with specific social roles, norms, and expectations. The youth stage is generally characterized by greater freedom and experimentation compared to childhood, before transitioning into the more settled responsibilities that come with adulthood. During this time, individuals are expected to learn, develop skills, and eventually establish their careers, relationships, and other aspects of adult life. 4. Legal implications: Countries and jurisdictions impose age specifications attached to specific rights and responsibilities concerning youth. For instance, at a certain age, individuals acquire the right to vote, consume alcohol, marry, or drive. These legal demarcations, grounded in social and developmental reasoning, govern and define ages of consent and the eligibility for specific privileges and responsibilities. In conclusion, youth is a term that encompasses a specific stage of human life that lies between childhood and adulthood. The rationale behind its usage is rooted in the recognition of physical and psychological development, social and cultural expectations, and legal implications that mark this period as distinct and crucial within a society."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Radical Islamic terrorism \\"must be stopped by whatever means necessary\\", US President Donald Trump has tweeted in the wake of attacks in Barcelona.","response":"Title: Combating Radical Islamic Terrorism: The Imperative of Global Action Introduction In the aftermath of the tragic attacks in Barcelona, US President Donald Trump has emphasized the immediate need to confront radical Islamic terrorism with an unyielding determination. Asserting that it \\"must be stopped by whatever means necessary,\\" the President's call to arms underscores the global significance of the issue and demands urgent attention. This article aims to provide an in-depth look at the challenges posed by radical Islamic terrorism and explores the potential strategies that countries can implement to address this threat. The Growing Threat of Radical Islamic Terrorism Over the past few decades, radical Islamic terrorism has emerged as one of the most pressing security challenges for countries across the globe. Terrorist attacks have claimed countless lives, devastated families, and altered our everyday lives in unfathomable ways. From the tragic events of September 11, 2001, to the more recent attacks in Brussels, Paris, and now Barcelona, it is evident that no country is immune to the dangers posed by extremist ideology. Driven by a violent interpretation of Islam, these extremists aim to impose their beliefs on others by employing brutal tactics, including suicide bombings, mass shootings, and other indiscriminate acts of violence. Though a minority within the religion, radical Islamic terrorists pose a significant threat to global peace and security. The Call for International Action In light of the President's remarks, it becomes increasingly clear that global action is both necessary and vital in tackling radical Islamic terrorism. No country can combat this problem alone; a united front is paramount to its success. This necessitates deeper collaboration and intelligence sharing among nations, which must overcome any political or ideological differences in the pursuit of a common goal. Strengthened intelligence networks are crucial to detecting and foiling terrorist plots before lives are endangered. Examples of successful collaboration include the capture of Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, the thwarting of numerous planned attacks worldwide, and the dismantling of terrorist cells through cooperation between international law enforcement agencies. Moreover, joint military action is often required in situations where terrorist organizations have established strongholds in certain regions. The international coalition against ISIS exemplifies this approach, with multiple countries coming together to launch a targeted military campaign aimed at weakening the group's influence and territorial control. Strategies for Countering Radical Islamic Terrorism While the call for global action is essential, it is important to outline specific strategies that can be employed in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism. These may include: 1. Addressing the root causes: Tackling the socio-economic and geopolitical factors that contribute to the growth of extremism is crucial. By investing in education, infrastructure, and social programs, countries can work to alleviate the broad sense of hopelessness and disenfranchisement that often drives individuals toward radicalization. 2. Disrupting terrorist financing: Cutting off the financial resources of extremist groups is essential to diminishing their global reach and impact. A comprehensive approach that targets both state and non-state actors funding these groups is necessary to hinder their expansion and operational capabilities. 3. Countering online radicalization: The internet has become a breeding ground for radicalization, with extremist groups using social media platforms to indoctrinate and recruit vulnerable individuals. Governments must work closely with technology companies to develop innovative solutions to detect, monitor, and counter online extremist content. 4. Promoting religious tolerance and inclusion: Fostering a sense of inclusion and tolerance among different religious communities through dialogue and interfaith initiatives is key to mitigating the polarization that often enables the spread of radical ideologies. 5. International cooperation and capacity building: A dynamic and coordinated approach that brings together the efforts of individual countries and international organizations is fundamental to confronting radical Islamic terrorism. This entails the provision of resources, training, and expertise to countries vulnerable to the spread of extremist ideology and the launch of initiatives aimed at promoting cohesion and exchange of best practices. Conclusion The fight against radical Islamic terrorism is a formidable challenge that demands persistent attention and resolve. As the attacks in Barcelona and around the world have shown, the threat is very real and pressing. Therefore, it is critical that nations come together, putting aside their differences, to find effective solutions and chart a path forward. The stakes are too high to allow extremist ideologies to dictate the course of our future. It is only through a committed, unified, and strategic approach that we can eliminate this scourge and build a safer, more peaceful world."},{"question":"Chicago Cubs: In 1975, a group of Chicago Cubs fans based in Washington, D.C. formed the Emil Verban Society. The society is a select club of high profile Cub fans, currently headed by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin which is named for Emil Verban, who in three seasons with the Cubs in the 1940s batted .280 with 39 runs batted in and one home run. Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cub player, explains columnist George Will, because \\"He exemplified mediocrity under pressure, he was competent but obscure and typifying of the work ethics.\\" Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed, but his ill feeling disappeared several years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan, also a society member, at the White House. Hillary Clinton, Jim Belushi, Joe Mantegna, Rahm Emanuel, Dick Cheney and many others have been included among its membership. Please answer a question about this article.

Andrew Oberle, a primatology student from the University of Texas at San Antonio, was being treated at a Johannesburg hospital after two chimps attacked him Thursday, spokeswoman Robyn Baard said. \\"He went though a 6-hour procedure of which doctors cleaned out his wounds and now it's a case of wait and see, and just to keep him sedated and comfortable for now,\\" she said. Oberle had been at the Jane Goodall Institute's Chimp Eden since May, according to Eugene Cussons, the facility's managing director. Oberle was at the sanctuary, near Nelspruit, South Africa, for the second time after training and volunteering there in 2010. His training included an explanation about \\"no-go\\" areas, spaces for animals where people are not supposed to go. Witnesses to the attack said that Oberle went into a no-go area because he seemed to want to remove a stone close to one of the animals that could have been picked up and thrown around, Cussons told CNN. Oberle crossed one barrier and approached a second one, which is a main fence with 24 strands of electrical wiring, Cussons said. Two male chimps grabbed Oberle and tried to drag him under the fence, but were not able to yank him into their enclosure. Zookeeper killed by wolves in Sweden. Cussons said he estimates the attack lasted 15 minutes. At some point, people tried to stop the chimps, and Cussons shot two rounds in the air to see if that might get them to retreat, he said. One of the chimps then charged at Cussons, he said. Cussons shot that chimp in the abdomen, he told CNN, and it seemed to shriek as a kind of signal to other chimps that there was a more powerful threat present. The chimps then backed off, he said. Oberle was rescued and transported for medical care. None of the 13 tourists, most of them from local areas, were harmed, officials said. The chimp that was shot had an operation at the Johannesburg zoo to repair damage to his small and large intestines. Hospital spokeswoman Baard declined to discuss the nature of Oberle's wounds. She said the student's parents had requested privacy, adding that they are \\"quite traumatized.\\" The sanctuary, which is featured in the Animal Planet program \\"Escape to Chimp Eden,\\" remains closed and its staff is receiving counseling, executive director David Oosthuizen said. There are no plans right now to euthanize the chimps involved in the attack, said Dries Pienaar, who is leading the investigation into the incident. He works for a parks agency that makes sure zoos, sanctuaries and breeding projects comply with the law. Pienaar told CNN that his preliminary findings are that human error is to blame, but he cautioned that his investigation is not complete and that he wants to interview Oberle. He hasn't spoken to all of the tourists yet, either. Chimp Eden was established as a home for rescued chimpanzees. Many of the primates have suffered \\"horrible injuries and abuse from humans,\\" according to the sanctuary. Neville Pillay, head of animal behavior at Wits University, said that violence in chimpanzees is not at all unusual. \\"Chimpanzees are known to be violent, and they can kill other animals. And male chimpanzees are particularly strong,\\" he said. Dave Salmoni, an expert in large predators for Animal Planet, said abused and captive chimpanzees can be particularly dangerous, likening the chimps to troubled prison inmates. \\"Now this is a very nice prison, but it's a prison nonetheless,\\" he said Monday. \\"And that's why you can see a lot of acting out behavior, and in some cases, with chimpanzees, they act out just because they can.\\" Oberle was passionate about studying chimpanzees, his friend Anthony Reimherr told CNN affiliate KXAN. He said it was \\"intriguing\\" to listen to Oberle when he spoke about the animals. \\"It's just something that he loved to do, and I think it's something that he'll always continue to do,\\" Reimherr said.

Article: In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news. However, if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was cut off Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations. Once a friend and I packed up some peanut, butter and sandwiches for an outing. As we walked light-heartedly out the door, picnic basket in hand, a smiling neighbor looked up at the sky and said, \\"Oh boy, bad day for a picnic.

Several months ago I was racing to catch a bus. As I breathlessly put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the sales agent said with a broad smile. \\"Oh that bus left five minutes ago.\\" Dreams of head cutting! It's not the news that makes someone angry. It's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must give bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient that she needs an operation does it in a caring way. A boss informing an employee he didn't get the job takes on a sympathetic tone. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of this. When you're tired from a long flight, has a hotel clerk cheerfully said that your room isn't ready yet? When you had your heart set on the toast beef, has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece? It makes you, as traveler or diner, want to land your fist fight on their unsympathetic faces. Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning.

He was the author of a chronicle or historical synopsis of events from the creation of the world to the end of the reign of Nikephoros Botaneiates ( 1081 ) , sponsored by Irene Komnene , the emperor 's sister - in - law . It consists of about 7000 lines in the so - called political verse . It obtained great popularity and appeared in a free prose translation ; it was also translated into Bulgarian and Roman Slavic in the 14th century and enjoyed a great popularity . Chronicle edition : Bekker , Bonn 1837 ; the Bulgarian translation , by Bogdan and Bianu ( \`\` Cronica lui Constantin Manasses ) , Bucarest , 1922 . In 1969 Bulgaria issued two sets of stamps depicting important scenes of the chronicle , to celebrate it . Manasses also wrote the poetical romance Loves of Aristander and Callithea , also in political verse , is only known from the fragments preserved in the rose - garden of Macanus Chrysocephalus ( 14th century ) . Manasses also wrote a short biography of Oppian , and some descriptive pieces ( all except one unpublished ) on artistic and other subjects . - The Komnenian Restoration is the term used by historians to describe the military, financial, and territorial recovery of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian dynasty, from the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 to the death of Andronikos I Komnenos in 1185. At the onset of the reign of Alexios I, the empire was reeling from its defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The empire was also being threatened by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who were invading the Balkans from their base in southern Italy. All this occurred as the empire's military institution was in disarray and had grown increasingly reliant on mercenaries. Previous emperors had also squandered the large gold deposits of Constantinople, so the defense of the empire had broken down, and there were few troops to fill the gaps. - Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus \\"Manoul I Komnnos\\"; 28 November 1118 24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean. His reign saw the last flowering of the Komnenian restoration, during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival. What is the relationship between 'constantine manasses' and 'byzantine empire'? Answer:","response":"Constantine Manasses was a Byzantine chronicler who flourished during the 12th century, specifically during the reign of Manuel I Komnenos (1143-1180), a Byzantine Emperor of the Komnenian dynasty.

This chronicle is significant in the context of the Byzantine Empire, as it provides insight into the history, culture, politics, and social issues during that era.

The Treadmill tape has better closeups of the girls (always very close to the naked girls during the entire tape). But in this Cycle Workout tape, you follow the naked girl riding a bike while in a camera-truck, so some shots are close, and some are not.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

The outer layer is made from cotton, which is a popular natural fiber known for its softness, breathability, and durability. Cotton is obtained from the cotton plant and has been used in textile production for thousands of years, due to its numerous beneficial properties. Some of these properties include its ability to absorb moisture, its hypoallergenic nature, and its ability to provide insulation in cooler temperatures. On the other hand, the inside of the material features a synthetic lining with padding. Synthetic materials are created using artificial fibers or polymers and have a range of useful characteristics. Often, these materials are more cost-effective and versatile than natural fibers, making them ideal for use in various applications. Synthetic linings offer a range of benefits, such as being lightweight, quick-drying, and resistant to mildew and insects. Moreover, they can be engineered with specific properties to suit specific needs, such as being waterproof or fire-resistant. The padding within the synthetic lining provides added insulation and comfort. This could come in the form of foam, polyester fibers, or other synthetic materials that are designed to trap air and create a barrier between the body and the external environment. This added insulation helps to maintain the wearer's warmth, especially during colder months or in colder climates. One common use for this type of material is in the construction of garments like jackets, blankets, and similar items that require both warmth and moisture control. The combination of cotton on the outside and synthetic lining with padding on the inside creates a balanced and effective insulating and moisture-wicking system that promotes the user's comfort and well-being. In summary, the material described - cotton outside and inside with synthetic lining and padding - is an effective combination of natural and synthetic fibers that provide a range of beneficial properties. With cotton's ability to absorb moisture and provide insulation, coupled with the synthetic lining's lightweight and quick-drying capabilities, this material is suitable for use in a variety of clothing and textile applications where warmth, insulation, and moisture control are required."},{"question":"Tilanne on sama offshore-porauksen keskeyttämisen osalta.

Change is a part of life and can be a positive thing if you use it correctly. Be prepared to grow and adapt at every stage of life. Ask yourself which aspects of your life are being influenced by past hurts, insecurities, and regrets. Once you identify those issues, commit to letting them go so that they no longer control who you are. Write out the things that frustrate you, or that you think hold you back. Expressing your feelings can help you let go of anything unpleasant in your past. This type of list can help you learn about the skills you need to develop in order to feel fulfilled. Realize that whatever your regrets are, in some ways you are better off than others. Focus on your strengths and other positive things you take away from your past. In order to reinvent yourself, it is important not to dwell too much on the past. However, there are often lessons you can take away from the past that can improve who you are in the present. Analyze a relationship that ended painfully to determine what went wrong. Think about what you can do to prevent the same thing from happening in your next relationship. Look at which decisions led you or your family to make financial mistakes in the past. Based on this, work to develop a financial plan for the future that corrects these errors. Correcting bad habits is an important part of leaving the old you behind. It can, however, be very difficult and even intimidating. Instead of trying to change yourself all at once, focus on breaking one bad habit at a time. Make a list of the habits that really bother your. Narrow it down to the top few that you would like to break, then start by working on the most important one. Focus on the positive feelings that you first have when trying to break a bad habit. This can help you succeed. Try replacing a negative habit with a positive one. For example, if you have a habit of snacking on junk food, replace it with healthy snacks, or spend more time exercising. As soon as a negative thought about yourself or your life pops into your mind, try replacing it with a positive one. Doing so trains your mind to focus on possibilities instead of difficulties. Conceptualize the things that cause you to feel stress. Think about how you have responded to them in the past. Then, actively replace negative thoughts about those stressors with positive ones. For instance, a bad date might cause you to think something like, “I'll never find someone. There must be something wrong with me.” Correct yourself with something like “This date went poorly, but that doesn't mean the right person isn't out there waiting for me. I won't find that person unless I keep looking.” Your opinion of yourself is formed in part by your idea of how others see you. If you really want to redefine yourself, however, you'll need to become the person you want to be, not the person someone else expects you to be. You also need to identify and step away from social pressure that comes from society itself. Society may hold certain expectations of you based on your race, gender, economic class, or religion, and these expectations can be just as restricting. What is a summary?","response":"Summary: Reinventing oneself is a positive and achievable process at any stage in life. Start by identifying past issues and letting them go, while learning from past mistakes and experiences. Focus on breaking one bad habit at a time and replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Recognize and conquer social pressure, and work towards becoming the person you truly want to be. Embrace change and growth to create a fulfilling life."},{"question":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People often talk as if shyness is a disease or mental condition that can be cured. I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul. Question: The author thinks that our shyness is there because _ . - we are not open enough - we don't feel secure at heart - we try to reach out to others all the time - we lack some social skills Answer:","response":"we don't feel secure at heart"},{"question":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Little Children Movie plot: Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a 30-year-old, stay-at-home mother in a small Massachusetts suburban community. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but once she married Richard (Gregg Edelman) and had their daughter, the presently five-year-old Lucy (Sadie Goldstein), she set aside her research. Now she spends her days taking Lucy to a local park along with three other stay at-home mothers: the severe and judgmental Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) and more timid Theresa (Trini Alvorado) and Cheryl (Marsha Dietlein). They enjoy ogling from a distance Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), the handsome and well built father who brings his son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. When their children use the same swing set, Sarah and Brad have an opportunity to talk to one another, titillating the other women. But when they, on a lark, hug and kiss, the women immediately take their children out of the park and refuse to associate with Sarah anymore.Both Brad and Sarah have unhappy home lives. Brad has yet to pass the Massachusetts state bar exam and doesn't even want to be a lawyer. However, his bossy wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), pushes him to succeed. She makes documentaries for public television for a living. They live a bit beyond their means, forcing them to accept financial support from Kathy's mother. Their sex life is non-existent because Kathy is too self-involved in her career and being a mother. When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again.

It is not what this country stands for. It’s antithetical to everything this country stands for. “Soldiers of this country liberated concentration camps toward the end of World War II and photographed what they saw there as a record of the barbarism we opposed. We didn’t do it that so that we could then duplicate it ourselves.” He criticized a Justice Department legal opinion issued early in the administration, and since rescinded, that allowed harsh interrogation techniques on terrorist suspects. “It was a mistake,” he said. “It was unnecessary.” Mr. Mukasey distanced himself from the idea that presidential power during wartime makes it unnecessary to consult Congress, a position espoused by Vice President Dick Cheney and David S. Addington, Mr. Cheney’s chief of staff and former legal counsel. “I think it’s been obvious from events of the last several years that everybody is better off — the president is better off, the Congress is better off, the country is better off — when everybody’s rolling in the same direction,” he said. “When the president acts pursuant to his authority with help from the Congress, with the tools that the Congress provides, then we don’t have to get into butting heads over who can and who can’t.” Mr. Mukasey declined to discuss recent news reports that the Justice Department, after rescinding the original opinion on harsh interrogation techniques, produced two secret legal opinions in 2005 that authorized similar techniques in terrorism cases. He said he could not comment on the later memorandums because he had not read them; he said he intended to review them early in his tenure at the Justice Department. When Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, suggested in his questioning that the 2005 opinions might authorize torture, Mr. Mukasey stopped him. “You characterize it as torture,” he said. “I do not know of such a policy, and I hope not to find them.” Nor would he comment in detail on the legality of the program of eavesdropping without warrants that was authorized by Mr. Bush shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks and has been strongly criticized by civil liberties groups and lawmakers from both parties as possibly unconstitutional. “I am not familiar with that program,” said Mr. Mukasey, who knew enough about the program to refer to it as the Terrorist Surveillance Program, the name preferred by the White House. The program remains highly classified, and Mr. Mukasey suggested that he had not given information since his nomination last month about how the National Security Agency program operates. “For me to make a categorical statement with regard to that program one way or the other, I think, would be enormously irresponsible,” he said. Whatever their concern about some of his answers on national security issues, senators from both parties appeared eager to vote to confirm Mr. Mukasey and have him go to work at the Justice Department as quickly as possible given the turmoil left there by Mr. Gonzales. “This nomination can begin the repair process” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and who led the effort to oust Mr. Gonzales. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the committee’s ranking Republican, told Mr. Mukasey that the department “urgently needs a restoration of integrity and honesty and independence.” “We have seen a situation where there have been serious allegations of political influence,” Mr. Specter said, “and it is very important that those matters be cleared up.” “Going right to the heart of the matter,” he continued, “are you prepared to resign if the president were to violate your advice — in your view, violate the Constitution of the United States on an important matter?” Mr. Mukasey replied: “That would present me with a difficult but not a complex problem. I would have two choices. I could either try to talk him out of it — or leave. Those are the choices.” Mr. Specter reframed the response: “If the alternative is to leave if you can’t talk him out of it, then I think the answer to my question is yes.” Mr. Mukasey nodded. “It is,” he said.

Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize?

Crocodilians use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey. One approach is that of the ambush.

He received offers from Boca Juniors and River Plate, but chose his boyhood club Estudiantes de La Plata, of whom he is a declared fan and has made significant donations in the past to upgrade the club training facilities. Chelsea agreed to loan Veron to Estudiantes for a season, until the end of his contract with the English club. On 13 December 2006, he helped Estudiantes win the Apertura 2006 tournament, its first in 23 years, in a final play-off match final over Boca Juniors. Some rival fans booed him, arguably dating back to his sub-par performances during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but Veron was ranked among the top three players in the 2006 Argentine League by sports newspaper Ole. Following his donations to the club's training grounds, Veron was a decisive factor in the agreement with La Plata city hall to update Estudiantes' historic stadium to modern standards. Veron personally engaged then Argentine president Nestor Kirchner to kick-start the negotiations, which had been stalled by La Plata mayor Julio Alak. Veron indicated that he may run for Estudiantes president in the future. In July 2007, Kevin Payne, president of Major League Soccer club D.C. United, met with Veron in Buenos Aires to discuss a possible transfer, but Veron decided to stay in Estudiantes. Veron suffered from a string of minor injuries after his return from the 2007 Copa America, and missed a number of important games during the 2007-08 season. In early 2008, several football personalities chose Veron as the best player in the Argentine league. Veron's fitness improved in time for the 2008-09 season, in which Estudiantes reached the finals of the Copa Sudamericana and secured a place in the 2009 Copa Libertadores. In 2009, he played in the Copa Libertadores for the second time, having seen Estudiantes eliminated in the round of 16 in the previous year by eventual champions Liga de Quito. After displaying his usual excellent level of play throughout the tournament, he found himself leading Estudiantes into the final for the first time since 1971. The Copa Libertadores has long been a special competition for Estudiantes and its fans, ever since the team won three consecutive titles from 1968-1970 with Veron's father playing a key role on the left wing. Veron certainly shared this affinity for the most prestigious title in the American continent, as evidenced by his declaration before the final: \\"I would trade everything I've won for this title.\\" His dream came true as Estudiantes won the final, after an aggregate of 2-1. A 0-0 tie in La Plata and a dramatic 2-1 win away in Belo Horizonte against Brazil's Cruzeiro sealed el pincha's triumph. Veron was chosen by visitors to fifa.com as the best player of the 2009 Copa Libertadores.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\", is \\"professionally fulfilled\\" a valid answer? Available choices: (A). Yes; (B). No; The answer is:","response":"(A). Yes; Although the term \\"professionally fulfilled\\" may not provide all the necessary details about Addison's occupation or personal traits, it can still be considered a valid answer in the context of the question. This is because the question, \\"How would you describe Addison?\\" is open-ended and can be answered in various ways, focusing on different aspects of Addison's life. By describing Addison as \\"professionally fulfilled,\\" it suggests that they are content with their chosen career and have likely achieved or are maintaining a sense of professional satisfaction and success. In this case, being a successful and well-paid surgeon at the hospital provides a reasonable basis for assuming that Addison is professionally fulfilled. This phrase acknowledges an aspect of Addison's overall well-being, focusing on the professional domain. However, it is important to note that a person's professional fulfillment is just one component of a complex and multi-faceted human experience. Other aspects of Addison's life, such as personal relationships, hobbies, or emotional well-being, remain unaddressed. Moreover, the phrase \\"professionally fulfilled\\" does not give any insight into Addison's particular skills as a surgeon, their personality, or character traits. In conclusion, while \\"professionally fulfilled\\" is a valid answer for describing Addison in the context of their career, it is not a comprehensive descriptor that covers all aspects of Addison's life. To provide a more holistic picture, additional information about their personal life, character traits, and passions outside of work would be relevant and useful."},{"question":"If During the Empire Period, an ambitious Hittite king, Mutawallis, defeated the forces of the Egyptian pharaoh, Ramses II, at Kadesh (Syria) in 1285 b.c., can we conclude that \\"Mutawallis, during the Empire Period, defeated Ramses II in 1286 b.c., which led him to death.\\"?","response":"Imagine a long, long time ago, there was a big and strong Hittite king named Mutawallis who wanted to win battles.

White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team's racers didn't have their muscles prepared for an activity? Answer:","response":"The Blue team's racers did not have their muscles prepared for the activity. As mentioned in the given paragraph, the White team warmed up properly before the race, which indicates that they effectively prepared their muscles for the upcoming physical activity. It is essential for athletes to warm up before engaging in any sport or rigorous activity, as it helps reduce the risk of injuries, improves flexibility, and increases the blood circulation to muscles, preparing them for the upcoming demand. In contrast, the Blue team arrived late due to transportation issues with the bus and did not have enough time to warm up before the start of the 5 km race. As a result, their racers did not have the opportunity to properly condition and prepare their muscles for the race, making them more prone to potential injuries, muscle strain, or overall less optimal performance during the competition. Warm-up exercises – including light aerobic activities, dynamic stretching, or sports-specific exercises – are crucial for athletes to prepare their bodies and ensure their muscles are ready to handle the stress, impact, and endurance of a race or other high-intensity activities. Therefore, in this scenario, the Blue team's racers are the ones that did not have their muscles adequately prepared for the activity."},{"question":"Read the below conversation. M: What did you do?

Richard Gaddis is a small-time crook with a penchant for con games. To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons. He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar. When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested. Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever. After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts. Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town. Gyllenhaal plays Gaddis' sister Valerie, a concierge at a hotel. When Hannigan takes a fancy to the uptight but very sexy Valerie, Gaddis is forced to pull her into the scam, the price of which is Richard's admission to their brother Michael that he has cheated him out of his share of their inheritance.

Answer:","response":"Leukemia The question asks for a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated. In this case, the best answer among the given choices is leukemia. Cancer is a broad term for various diseases characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells, which can invade and damage healthy tissue. In particular, leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. Leukemia occurs when the DNA of immature blood cells, specifically the white blood cells, becomes damaged, and they grow and divide uncontrollably. Since the cell cycle is no longer regulated, these abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow, crowding out healthy blood-forming cells. This leads to a deficiency of normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, which can cause various complications such as infections, anemia, and increased bleeding tendency. There are different types of leukemia, classified based on the types of blood cells affected and the rate of progression. Some of the common types include: 1. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - Fast-growing leukemia affecting lymphoid cells; most common in children. 2. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) - Fast-growing leukemia affecting myeloid cells; can occur in both children and adults. 3. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) - Slow-growing leukemia affecting lymphoid cells; most common in adults over the age of 55. 4. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) - Slow-growing leukemia affecting myeloid cells; usually diagnosed in adults.

FBI spokesman Paul Bresson had no comment on the reported investigation. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was informed that an FBI inquiry was under way. The senator from Georgia and other leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees issued a joint statement Tuesday deploring the apparent leaks. \\"In recent weeks, we have become increasingly concerned at the continued leaks regarding sensitive intelligence programs and activities, including specific details of sources and methods,\\" said Chambliss; Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California; Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan; and Ranking Member C.A. \\"Dutch\\" Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, in the statement. \\"I know that people at the OPTIONS: - CNN were not involved,\\" he said. - Chambliss were not involved,\\" he said. - D-California were not involved,\\" he said. - D-Maryland were not involved,\\" he said. - Dianne Feinstein were not involved,\\" he said. - Dutch were not involved,\\" he said. - FBI were not involved,\\" he said. - Georgia were not involved,\\" he said. - House were not involved,\\" he said. - Iran were not involved,\\" he said. - Mike Rogers were not involved,\\" he said. - New York Times were not involved,\\" he said. - Paul Bresson were not involved,\\" he said. - R-Michigan were not involved,\\" he said. - Republican were not involved,\\" he said. - Ruppersberger were not involved,\\" he said. - Saxby Chambliss were not involved,\\" he said. - Senate Intelligence Committee were not involved,\\" he said. - Senate Intelligence Committees were not involved,\\" he said. - U.S were not involved,\\" he said. - U.S. were not involved,\\" he said. - White House were not involved,\\" he said.","response":"In the context of the information provided, it could be challenging to definitively conclude on who was not involved in the leak involving cyberwarfare program against Iran as the text does not clearly imply that. However, it's significant to discuss the specific roles and the implications of their involvement or lack thereof in the proceedings. In your list, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is mentioned as having been informed about the FBI investigation. He, Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, and ranking Member C.A. \\"Dutch\\" Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, released a joint statement expressing their concern about the ongoing leaks related to the country's sensitive intelligence programs and activities. Given their positions in the Senate Intelligence Committee, they are likely to be involved in the investigation, albeit not as the initiators of the leak. Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman, had no comment about the investigation. Though the FBI is conducting the investigation, it doesn't imply the institution or its employees are the source of the leak. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that entities such as \\"Paul Bresson,\\" \\"FBI,\\" and \\"Senate Intelligence Committee\\" were not involved in the leaking of classified information. On the contrary, to comment on entities like \\"CNN,\\" \\"New York Times,\\" or \\"White House\\" would be speculative without further information. Media outlets like CNN or the New York Times often receive leaked information from anonymous sources, which they might then report to the public. As these organizations were not specifically mentioned in the leak context, it's unclear if they played any part. Lastly, considering the nature of the information leaked which pertains to a program against \\"Iran,\\" it's less likely that Iran was involved in the leaking of the information. However, this cannot be determined definitively without additional context or information. Therefore, while many entities from your list could have intersecting interests or involvement in this incident, determining those which were not involved in the leak would necessitate more in-depth data. The analysis suggests \\"Paul Bresson,\\" \\"FBI,\\" \\"Senate Intelligence Committee,\\" and possibly \\"Iran\\" may not be involved in the actual leaking of classified information, but their exact connection to the event requires further clarification."},{"question":"Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup. Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give \\"Les Bleus\\" a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. \\"I will be honest. It was a handball but I am not the referee,\\" the Barcelona striker told reporters after the match in Paris. The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play. \\"Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it. Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay,\\" Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN. \\"They probably won't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let's put them on the spot. It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country. Otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win.\\" The FAI later confirmed that it had taken the matter to FIFA. \\"I really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night,\\" chief executive John Delaney told reporters. \\"The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay.\\" Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation. \\"They need to look at themselves in this situation. Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner? If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy,\\" he said. \\"It is up to the people who govern the game now. Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity. This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward.\\" The FAI has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out, following FIFA's ruling that Uzbekistan had to replay a play-off against Bahrain for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty. \\"The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected,\\" the FAI said. FIFA confirmed it had received the Irish request for a replay, but gave no timescale on a decision. However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed. \\"Law 5 states that the decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final,\\" it said. \\"The referee may only change a decision on realising that it is incorrect or, at his discretion, on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official, provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match.\\" Irish captain Richard Dunne, who spoke to Henry on the final whistle, said he felt cheated by the goal. \\"He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals,\\" the defender said. \\"FIFA will probably be happy. Yet again the big decisions have gone for the bigger team.\\" Football's international governing body had faced criticism from several Irish players that the seeding system for the play-off draw favored more powerful nations such as France. Blog: When will FIFA see what's staring them in the face? Dunne's teammate Robbie Keane admitted it was \\"hard to speak,\\" as he struggled to come to terms with the result. \\"With the way we played, we certainly deserved to win the game and it killed us near the end with that handball,\\" he was quoted by the FAI Web site as saying. \\"I've seen the replay but we knew anyway (it was handball). You could see by the reaction of the players, especially Shay (Given) who was two yards away from it. You don't get a reaction like that. It was a clear handball. \\"He (Henry) almost caught the ball and actually ran into the net with it. We're devastated.\\" Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry. \\"It would not have been the first time a player would have asked and it would not have been out of turn. \\"We are angry,\\" the Italian continued. \\"It is a bitter evening for me. I would prefer to have gone out on penalties.\\" Fanzone: Five of football's most famous injustices.

Irish football officials have lodged a complaint with FIFA following Thierry Henry's admission that he handled the ball during the build-up to France's winning goal, which decided their entry into the World Cup. 2. Television footage showed Thierry Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored the consequential goal. 3. Ireland's Justice Ministry confirmed Dermot Ahern’s request for the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay. 4. The FAI submitted the issue to FIFA, with its chief executive John Delaney stating that the game’s integrity is being doubted. 5. FAI also reasoned that there is a precedent for the result to be cancelled, citing FIFA's decision that Uzbekistan had to replay a game against Bahrain in the 2006 World Cup due to a referee error. 6. FIFA confirmed the receipt of the Irish request for a replay, but declared according to its regulations, the referee's decision can't be changed. 7.

Beginning its journey in 1851, the NYT has solidified its place as a bastion of top-notch journalism, crossing boundaries and reporting on global events with accuracy, integrity, and reliability. In this article, we delve into the historical background of the newspaper, its editorial stance through the years, and its present-day significance in the digital age. The Historical Background Step 1: Begin with the founding of The New York Times in 1851 The New York Times was founded on September 18, 1851, by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond and former banker George Jones. Initially known as the New-York Daily Times, the publication provided a daily news source for a growing population of readers. From the beginning, the founders aimed to deliver accurate and objective news to the public. Step 2: Discuss the early years and its growth Throughout the latter half of the 19th century, the newspaper gained increasing respect and readership, not just in New York, but across the nation. With outstanding reporting on important events, The New York Times ever steered clear of sensationalizing stories or pandering to short-lived trends. Long form reportage and editorial independence were cherished values that set the paper apart from many contemporaries. Editorial Stance Through the Years Step 3: Analyze political leanings and independence The New York Times has, over the years, developed a reputation for maintaining an editorial stance that leans towards the liberal end of the spectrum. However, it has consistently championed the ideals of independent journalism—presenting diverse perspectives by including balanced and well-researched opinion pieces. The Times' dedication to factual reporting is a key reason why readers from around the globe continue to trust it as a credible news source. Step 4: Discuss the role of public editor and self-critique To maintain its commitment to objective journalism, The New York Times introduced the role of a public editor in 2003. This public editor acts as a critic and liaison to the readership, addressing issues about the newspaper's reporting and editorial decisions. Making room for constructive critique exemplifies the organization's dedication to upholding journalistic excellence.

He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. and a hint : Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. Please answer this question : Would the air pressure inside lungs increase or decrease in state A?

Sometimes the mailed notices are benign: You forgot to sign your return, or the IRS recalculated your entries and found that you made a math error and are due a refund. But the more ominous ones question income, deductions or some other entry. The IRS defines an audit as \\"a review-examination\\" of a return \\"to verify the amount of tax reported is accurate.\\" If you are selected for one, the agency has on its website a video guide to the process. In 2011, the IRS audited nearly 1.6 million individual returns, slightly more than 1% of the total filed. About three-quarters were done by correspondence, the rest through field examinations done in person by an IRS agent. Only 1% of people with incomes under 200,000 had their returns audited; the audit rate for those with incomes of 1 million and higher was about 12.5%. IRS spokesman Terry Lemons said the vast majority of taxpayers fill out their returns accurately and have nothing to be concerned about. \\"We have a variety of screening processes to make sure we catch the people who are cutting corners,\\" he said. So how does the IRS select which returns to audit? \\"There's no magic equation,\\" said Mark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Services. Some returns are selected for audit through computer screening. An IRS computer \\"basically compares data from your return to average numbers from people in similar situations and they look for variances,\\" said Jeff Schnepper, author of How to Pay Zero Taxes (McGraw-Hill, 2011). \\"They look for big changes, things that shouldn't be there,\\" he said. What's reviewed are things like charitable contributions, interest income, and whether there are variations from averages in your income bracket or zip code. \\"Every time there's a major variance, the computer is going to click,\\" he said. Others are selected randomly, and still another group is selected by document matching to see if forms like the W-2 match what was reported on your income tax return. There's yet another category — \\"related examinations,\\" the IRS calls it. \\"Returns may be selected for audit when they involve issues or transactions with other taxpayers, such as business partners or investors, whose returns were selected for audit. \\" The agency will notify taxpayers of an impending audit by telephone or mail. E-mail is not used, the agency said. \\"Just because your return has been selected for an audit doesn't suggest you made an error or you're dishonest,\\" the IRS says in its video guide. \\"It might surprise you to know that audits can result in acceptance of the tax return without change or even a refund.\\" The IRS has a Declaration of Taxpayer Rights that sets forth what you can expect from an audit, ranging from privacy and confidentiality to professional and courteous service. Taxpayers have the right to representation at an audit or to have someone else represent them, and to make an audio recording of the session. They may appeal the judgment, either to the Appeals Office or to a court, and can request that penalties and interest be waived. Accuracy is the best defense in an audit — and having the records to confirm it. Lemons said using tax preparation software and filing electronically can help catch some common mistakes. \\"It's important that you do things accurately, and you think through those items reported by third parties and make sure those are going to match up,\\" said Greg Rosica, tax partner at Ernst & Young accounting firm. He advises paying attention to the simple things — like correctly reporting your Social Security number or the number of dependents. \\"If you've gone through and you have a well-organized file, there's not so much to be worried about,\\" he said. Steber said that claiming deductions for a home office likely will attract IRS scrutiny. As for charitable contributions, he said there's no particular amount likely to catch the IRS' attention. \\"Don't shortchange yourself,\\" he said. Find out what donated items sell for, at a thrift store, for example, or check valuation tools on the Internet. \\"It's all in the documentation,\\" he said. Schnepper said the IRS sometimes focuses on taxpayers with cash earnings, like waiters and waitresses. \\"The IRS is looking for unreported income,\\" he said. It's important to keep the records you've used to file your returns for at least three years. Generally that's the time frame in which the IRS can conduct an audit. \\"The name of the game with the IRS is paper,\\" Schnepper said. \\"Keep your records. Keep your receipts. If you have your receipts, you win.\\" What was this article about?","response":"This article is about IRS audits, which are when the IRS checks a person's tax return to make sure they reported the right amount of tax. It explains that audits can be scary for people, but most people fill out their tax returns correctly and have nothing to worry about.

How to grow anthurium plants Prepare a soil mix. Anthurium prefers a coarse, well-draining soil. Try a mixture of equal parts perlite, peat moss, and pine bark.","response":"Additionally, you can supplement the mixture with a dash of horticultural charcoal and a slow-release fertilizer to optimize nutrient availability and improve overall soil conditions. Once you have prepared the soil mix, follow these steps to ensure successful growth and maintenance of your anthurium plant: 1. Select a suitable container: Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot. Ideally, the container should be at least two inches larger in diameter than the plant's root ball, providing ample space for growth. 2. Plant your anthurium: Gently remove the anthurium from its current container, taking care not to damage the roots. Place the plant in the new pot, making sure the top of the root ball is approximately one inch below the pot's rim. Fill in around the roots with your prepared soil mix, and gently press down the soil to remove any air pockets. 3. Water and light requirements: Water your anthurium plant thoroughly after planting. The plant prefers consistently moist soil, but it is crucial to avoid overwatering. Check the top inch of soil regularly and water when it feels slightly dry. Anthuriums thrive in bright, indirect light with temperatures ranging from 65°F to 85°F. Place the pot near a window where it will receive filtered sunlight or growing under fluorescent lights. 4. Humidity and air circulation: Anthurium plants flourish in a humid environment. To increase humidity around your plant, place it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier. Ensure there is proper air circulation to discourage pests and diseases, but avoid placing the plant near drafts, air conditioners, or heating vents. 5. Fertilization: Feed your anthurium every six to eight weeks with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer, diluted to half-strength. Regularly providing nutrients will encourage the growth of vibrant foliage and blooms. 6. Pruning and maintenance: Prune your anthurium by removing dead or damaged leaves and spent flower spikes with a clean, sharp pair of scissors. This will promote new growth and maintain the plant's healthy appearance. Additionally, clean the leaves gently with a damp cloth to remove dust and support photosynthesis. 7. Watch for pests and diseases: Monitor your anthurium plant for common pests, such as aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. Safely manage these issues by using insecticidal soap or neem oil. Keep an eye out for signs of diseases, like root rot or bacterial and fungal infections, and treat promptly to prevent them from spreading. 8. Repotting: As anthurium plants grow, they may become root-bound, which can limit their overall health and growth. Monitor your plant and repot it in a slightly larger container every two to three years, during the spring or summer months, using fresh soil mix. By following these comprehensive guidelines and giving proper attention and care, you'll be well on your way to nurturing a thriving, eye-catching anthurium plant with lush foliage and stunning blooms to enjoy for years to come."},{"question":"Teacher:Classify the given a piece of financial news into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.

But recent findings offer good news for older people and for people worried about getting older. Researchers found that people become happier and experience less worry after they reach the age of fifty. In fact, they say by the age of eighty-five, people are happier with their life than they were when they were eighteen years old. The findings came from a survey of more than three hundred forty thousand adults in the United States. The Gallup Organization questioned them by telephone in 2008. At that time, the people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five. The researchers asked questions about emotions like happiness, sadness and worry. They also asked about mental or emotional stress. Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study. His team found that levels of stress were highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five. The findings showed that stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties. The study also showed that men and women have similar feeling patterns as they grow older. However, women at all ages reported more sadness, stress and worry than men. Researchers say they do not know why happiness increases as people get older. One theory is that, as people grow older, they grow older, they grow more thankful for what they have and have better control of their feelings. They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences. Professor Stone says the emotional patterns could be linked to changes in how people see the world, or maybe even changes in brain chemistry. The researchers also considered possible influences like having young children, being unemployed or being single. But they found that influences like these did not affect the levels of happiness and well-being related to age.

Police surround the bank and detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food. The police supply pizzas whose boxes include listening devices; these pick up a language which the police finally identify as Albanian. However, they discover that the conversations are just old propaganda recordings of the deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha; it becomes clear that the robbers anticipated surveillance. After being informed of the robbery, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, hires \\"fixer\\" Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to try to protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. White, with assistance from the Mayor of New York City, arranges a conversation with Russell, who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum to destroy the contents of the box. She claims she can arrange a minimal jail sentence as Russell and his team have not yet stolen anything or hurt or killed anyone; Russell declines her offers. Frazier demands...

He was the third of eight children. He credits his parents with instilling virtues of hard work and discipline into him and his siblings; \\"They taught us to be honest, work hard, respect our elders, and believe in ourselves\\". Olajuwon has expressed displeasure at his childhood in Nigeria being characterized as backward. \\" \\"The best footwork I've ever seen from a big man\\" --Pete Newell Olajuwon established himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark Dream Shake. Executed with uncanny speed and power, they are still regarded as the pinnacle of \\"big man\\" footwork. Shaquille O'Neal stated: \\"Hakeem has five moves, then four countermoves - that gives him 20 moves.\\" Olajuwon himself traced the move back to the soccer-playing days of his youth. \\"The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot.\\" The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend, much like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky-hook. One notable Dream Shake happened in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, drove to the basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup. Olajuwon has referred to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: \\"When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I'm gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don't know that where I'm going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can't react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don't have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don't have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn't know which way I'm going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn't know where you're gonna turn and when.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What is the dream shake?","response":"The Dream Shake is a special move in basketball that Hakeem Olajuwon developed. It involves a series of fakes, spin moves, and jumps to trick the defender and make it easy to score. The move comes from Hakeem's soccer-playing days and was adapted to basketball. It is designed to either misdirect the opponent, freeze them in their tracks, or shake them off, making it hard for them to defend the shot."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net. Some white supremacists will even price racist merchandise, such as t-shirts or compact discs, for 14.88. The symbol is most commonly written as 1488 or 14/88, but variations such as 14-88 or 8814 are also common.

Outside the museum is a camera and people can come and stand in front of it for as long as they want repeating the words “He will not divide us.” The video will be streamed continuously for four years, or as long as Donald Trump is President. Yesterday, the “He Will Not Divide Us” official Twitter account tweeted out this video of a White Supremacist who showed up and started talking into the camera, including saying, as our cousin site Gossip Cop pointed out, something that sounds like “praise Hitler.” White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down.

Before things got (more) physical, the man left, and the crowd cheered. Other moments have been much more positive. At one point, a man was there by himself for a while. Eventually, a woman came and joined him, saying she had been watching from home and had become inspired. [featured image via Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock, Inc.] Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| He Will Not Divide Us/Twitter “He Will Not Divide Us,” the four-year-long anti-Trump participatory art installation from Shia LaBeouf, Nastja Sade Ronkko, and Luke Turner, was the site of a showdown between actor LaBeouf and an unidentified white supremacist on Sunday, Raw Story reports. The project, at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, invites visitors to say the words “He will not divide us” into a camera for a 24-hour livestream, which will be broadcast on the web for the entirety of the Trump presidency. The problem was that not everyone wanted to say “He will not divide us.” To be more specific, a Nazi showed up who wanted to say “1488,” instead. (Calling modern-day white supremacists Nazis may be imprecise in many cases, but this guy was literally wearing a SS M43 field cap, though he at least was ashamed of himself enough to remove the Totenkopf.) “1488,” of course, is a white supremacist code number that combines white supremacy’s 14-word creed with a reference to “Heil Hitler,” H being the eighth letter of the alphabet. It was created by white supremacist murderer David Lane, the same charmer who invented the “white genocide” myth. (Saying “Heil Hitler,” even in code, is another cutoff point where it probably ought to be ok to call someone a Nazi.) Advertisement LaBeouf, who was there at the time, sensed that a man wearing the uniform of a long-defeated army of racists might not be in the spirit of the thing, and, as can be seen in a video posted to a fan account for the project, successfully shut him down:* White supremacist yells into the camera and Shia LaBeouf shuts him down. This has been a very interesting live stream. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/CqY9pLobWi — #HeWillNotDivideUs (@HWNDUS) January 23, 2017 Rather than engaging in the morally controversial act of Nazi-punching, LaBeouf decided that the answer to hate speech was more speech. He followed the guy around until he returned to the microphone (to tell the world, “We must secure the existence of the white race”) then simply out-yelled him while edging him out of frame. Watching the Nazi try to work his way back to the camera (and fail) is another bittersweet pleasure of the Trump era. Yes, the Nazi looks pathetic, and yes, this is a punch-free Nazi fiasco that we can all enjoy. But a funny web video is a poor consolation for the time—not so long ago!—when fewer Americans thought it was ok to become Nazis to begin with. ||||| Add a location to your Tweets When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats? === The answer to the above question is (1).

Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\\" \\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\\" \\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\\". \\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully... Question: What are characteristics of Amerimail? Options: A: Stiff and cold B: Casual and indirect C: Informal and chatty D: Formal and direct A:","response":"The correct answer is C: Informal and chatty. This choice is justified by several parts of the text in the article. It explicitly mentions that \\"Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \\"Hi\\" and end with a \\"Bye\\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \\"xoxo\\" are disturbingly high\\". Furthermore, the text also describes Amerimail as casually sharing information about personal life and holidays before jumping into the actual content. It contrasts this with Euromail by saying \\"You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail.\\" This cements the choice C: Informal and chatty as the accurate description of Amerimail based on the information from the article."},{"question":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs. Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - David Louis \\"Dave\\" Bartholomew (born December 24, 1918) is an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger and record producer, prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he has been active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz and Dixieland. He has been cited by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a key figure in the transition from jump blues and swing to R&B and as \\"one of the Crescent Citys greatest musicians and a true pioneer in the rock and roll revolution.\\" - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - \`\` I 'm Walkin ' '' is a 1957 song by Fats Domino , written together with Dave Bartholomew . The single was Fats Domino 's third release in a row to reach number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart , where it stayed for six weeks . The single also continued Fats Domino 's crossover appeal when \`\` I 'm Walkin ' '' peaked at number four on the pop singles chart . The song was featured in The Blues Brothers movie , during the scene in which the orphanage kids help spread the word of the band 's revival concert . - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Jump blues is an up-tempo style of blues, usually played by small groups and featuring saxophone or brass instruments. It was popular in the 1940s and was a precursor of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Appreciation of jump blues was renewed in the 1990s as part of the swing revival. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home.

Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"I do this task because it is interesting.\\" - Sentence B: \\"I do this task because it is boring.\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","response":"Both sentences can make sense depending on the context and perspective of the speaker. Here's a step-by-step analysis of each sentence: - Sentence A: \\"I do this task because it is interesting.\\" This sentence makes sense, as the speaker engages in the task because they find it interesting or engaging. Many people choose to perform activities based on their level of interest. - Sentence B: \\"I do this task because it is boring.\\" At first glance, this sentence may seem nonsensical because people typically avoid boring tasks. However, it can make sense if we consider the speaker's intention. For example, the speaker may choose to engage in a boring task intentionally to practice improving their focus, patience, or discipline. Another possible reason could be that they are doing the task to overcome procrastination or to appreciate more engaging tasks in the future. In conclusion, neither of the sentences is inherently nonsensical, as both can make sense depending on the context and the speaker's perspective."},{"question":"Sentence: name = The Wrestlers, food = Fast food, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 3 out of 5, familyFriendly = no Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","response":"Certainly! To represent the content in the given sentence, I will first identify the key pieces of information.

Sentence 2: In 2014 , the founding member of 15 years of age left Devin Abrams and was replaced by Dan McGruer . Do these two sentences convey the same information? Available options: - no - yes","response":"No, these two sentences do not convey the same information. Sentence 1 refers to Devin Abrams, who has been a founding member of the band for 15 years, and in 2014, he left the band and was replaced by Dan McGruer. This sentence suggests that Devin Abrams was a part of the band for a period of 15 years. Sentence 2, on the other hand, seems to suggest that the founding member who left the band was 15 years of age. The syntax and phrasing of this sentence could be interpreted to mean that Devin Abrams was a minor at the time he left the band. You might infer that Devin Abrams was young when he left the band, but there is no information regarding the length of time he had been a band member. In summary, Sentence 1 conveys that Devin Abrams was a band member for 15 years before leaving, while Sentence 2 conveys that the band member that left was 15 years old.

It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","response":"Tak'alik Ab'aj first started to flourish in the Preclassic period, which began in the 9th century BC. So, it first started to flourish in the 9th century BC, meaning it was in the 1st millennium BC. To specify the century, it falls under the 10th century BC."},{"question":"Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno.

Options: - make time for - take money - go outdoors - leave work - field Explain why a human would choose \\"leave work\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"leave work\\" to answer the question above for several reasons. The information provided in the question implies that the woman's schedule becomes hectic once she finishes a particular task. The provided options indicate various activities a person might undertake, but the context suggests the search for a turning point in her day where her responsibilities and time constraints become more pronounced. Examining each option reveals that \\"leave work\\" is the most logical choice: 1. \\"Make time for\\": This phrase implies that the woman is deliberately carving out time in her day for something specific. However, the nature of her busy schedule, as described in the question, indicates that her day lacks available time to dedicate to other activities. Furthermore, the question is searching for a point at which she must start running errands and picking up the kids, not what she might be doing beforehand. Consequently, this option is a less likely answer. 2. \\"Take money\\": This phrase, while potentially connected to her busy schedule, does not provide a clear explanation of when her day becomes more hectic. The act of taking or withdrawing money is a relatively quick and event-less task that does not provide any insight into why her schedule would suddenly become busy. This option does not fit the question's context well and therefore is less suitable as an answer. 3. \\"Go outdoors\\": While going outdoors may be a part of running errands, it does not encompass picking up the kids or other potential tasks she must complete. Since this phrase lacks a necessary connection to the woman's busy schedule, it is not a strong candidate for answering the question. 4. \\"Leave work\\": This option is the most logical choice because it identifies a turning point in a typical workday. The phrase implies that the woman is finishing her professional obligations and transitioning to her personal responsibilities. As a result, her schedule becomes busier because she must now accomplish all her personal tasks, such as running errands and picking up the kids, before completing her day. Many working parents experience this change in pace after leaving work, making this answer relatable and more plausible in context. 5. \\"Field\\": This word, taken on its own, is ambiguous and does not fit the context of the question. It could potentially refer to a physical location or a broader professional field, but neither interpretation can be tied directly to her busy schedule. Considering these reasons, it becomes clear that a human would choose \\"leave work\\" to answer the question. By identifying the end of her workday as the moment her schedule becomes overwhelming, the chosen phrase concisely and adequately describes the context provided in the question. Such a choice reflects an understanding of the woman's dual roles as a professional and a parent while also acknowledging the limited time available to complete a day's worth of responsibilities."},{"question":"Information: - Network Ten (commonly known as Channel Ten or simply Ten, officially stylised as TEN) is an Australian commercial broadcasting network owned by Ten Network Holdings, and is headquartered in Pyrmont, New South Wales.

Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate π. The digits appear to be randomly distributed. In particular, the digit sequence of π is conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness, but to date, no proof of this has been discovered. Also, π is a transcendental number; that is, a number that is not the root of any non-zero polynomial having rational coefficients. This transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge. Question: can we find the last digit of pi? Options: (i) no; (ii) yes;","response":"(i) No The answer to the question of whether we can find the last digit of π (pi) is no. This is because π is an irrational number, which means that its decimal representation has an infinite number of digits with no repeating pattern or discernable order. This property of irrational numbers makes it impossible to identify a \\"last digit\\" for π, as its decimal expansion goes on indefinitely. To better understand this, let's first consider how this number is generated. π is derived from the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is a fundamental constant that plays a significant role in various areas of mathematics and science. Its significance is not limited to geometry; it can be found in other areas such as trigonometry, calculus, and even theoretical physics. One of the key characteristics of π, as mentioned before, is that it is an irrational number. This means it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction with a finite decimal representation, like common, everyday numbers such as 1/2 (which is 0.5) or 3/4 (which is 0.75). The decimal representation of irrational numbers like π, however, expands indefinitely without repeating. Throughout history, many mathematicians have attempted to determine an accurate approximation of π. Several well-known approximations include: 1. 22/7, which is approximately 3.142857 2. 355/113, which is approximately 3.1415929 3. 3.14159265358979323846… (π to 20 decimal places) It should be noted that despite its seemingly random order, the digits of π are conjectured to satisfy a specific type of statistical randomness called normality. However, this property has not been proven conclusively, and the distribution of the digits of π remains an open question for mathematicians. In addition to being irrational, π is also a transcendental number. This means that it is not the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. The significance of π's transcendental nature is that it renders certain geometric problems, such as squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge, impossible to solve. In summary, it is not possible to find the last digit of π, as it is an irrational number with an infinite and non-repeating decimal expansion. The search for increasingly accurate approximations will continue, but ultimately, π remains an entity that can never be fully captured in a finite number of digits."},{"question":"Choose your answer.Available options: a). no; b). yes;.

While the prevailing theories of the time held that Polynesia had been settled by peoples migrating from the west, Heyerdahl, an experimental ethnographer and adventurer, sets out to prove his theory that people from South America settled the islands in pre-Columbian times. Noting similarities between statues found in South America and the Polynesian moai, Heyerdahl's theory about the origin of the Polynesian people is bolstered by Polynesian folklore that tells of an ancient tribe called the Hanau epe that are said to have once inhabited Easter Island. While most experts hold that such a voyage across the vast ocean is unlikely to have ever been successful, in order to illustrate that there were no technological limitations that would have inhibited the ancient peoples from making the journey, Heyerdahl puts his theory to the test and builds a balsawood raft using the same techniques that would have been utilized 1,500 years ago by the indigenous peoples of the region. Though he himself cannot swim or sail, he sets out on the treacherous 4,300 nautical mile–journey across the Pacific from Peru to Polynesia aboard the small raft, along with his crew of five men (and a macaw named Lorita). During the three months aboard the primitive vessel named after Inca god of sun and storm, Kon-Tiki, the crew's scientific reenactment of the legendary voyage from the coast of Peru to the Polynesian islands is met with setbacks in the form of storms, sharks, and other perils of the open sea. contains an answer for the question: Whose journey is Heyerdahl emulating to prove they could have reached Easter Island?, what is it ?

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Question: Why should goals be set Answer: The answer is:","response":"Goals should be set because they provide several important functions in achieving desired outcomes and personal growth. Here is a detailed explanation of the various reasons why setting goals is essential: 1. Direction and Focus: Goals help to provide direction and purpose in our lives. When we set goals, we are creating an action plan that guides us towards a specific objective. This direction gives our actions a clear purpose and allows us to maintain focus, ensuring that our efforts are aligned with our overall vision. 2. Motivation: Setting goals acts as a powerful motivator, as it helps us identify what is truly important to us and provides a sense of accomplishment once we achieve them. This motivation fuels our efforts and increases our perseverance, driving us to overcome obstacles and challenges that may arise along the way. 3. Measurable Progress: One of the significant advantages of setting goals is the ability to measure progress. By breaking the ultimate goal into smaller, more manageable chunks, we can track our achievements over specific periods (daily, weekly, monthly), allowing us to evaluate our progress, celebrate milestones, and adjust our approach if necessary. 4. Time Management and Efficiency: Goal setting helps to enhance time management and improve efficiency in our daily lives. When we have clear objectives, we can prioritize tasks effectively, allocate time and resources wisely, and set realistic deadlines for ourselves. This enables us to make the most of our time, maintain focus on the task at hand and avoid distractions. 5. Personal Growth and Development: Goals play a crucial role in promoting personal growth and development. When we set and pursue goals, we step out of our comfort zones, develop new skills, become more resilient, and discover our inner strengths. This process of self-improvement and self-discovery fosters self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-esteem. 6. Satisfaction and Sense of Achievement: Achieving goals provides a deep sense of satisfaction, accomplishment, and fulfillment. This feeling of success can improve our overall sense of well-being, happiness, and quality of life, further motivating us to continue setting and achieving new goals. In summary, setting goals is essential because it provides us with direction, focus, motivation, a tool for evaluating progress, improved time management and efficiency, personal growth and development, and a deep sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Goals enable us to make constructive choices, remain persistent in challenging situations, and stay focused on our ultimate targets, ensuring long-term success in our personal and professional lives."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: A famished Wile E. Coyote, (Eatibus Anythingus), trudges across the floor of the desert, catching anything that he can find, from a fly to an empty tin can, with the intention of eating it. Suddenly, he is flattened by the Road Runner, (Hot-roddicus Supersonicus). Wile recovers, blinks his eyes, and has a vision of a wonderful Road Runner feast. He then ditches the tin can and chases after the Road Runner, adopting a low stance to reduce his drag which allows him to close in on the Road Runner, but the bird finds another gear and rockets away, leaving the coyote's eyes to pop out of his sockets. Dejected, he plans his next scheme.Wile sets up a pulley, rope and rock trap to try smashing the passing Road Runner, hoping its extra complexity will stop Wile from being squashed, but the rock finds a way to squash the coyote as the Road Runner stops to mock him.A furious Wile arms himself with a lasso as he waits for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso before the bird can get there, and drags Wile across the hard ground. As the coyote paces off the road, we see that the friction has left Wile with a bare rear end.Wile then uses a How-To book to build a Burmese tiger trap. He digs a square pit in the road and fills it with a sheet camouflaged as a road.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\". - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel. - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting .

The name \\"Melbourne\\" refers to an urban agglomeration spanning which comprises the broader metropolitan area, as well as being the common name for its city centre. The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley. Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities. It has a population of 4,529,500 , and its inhabitants are called Melburnians. - The World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP. Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as \\"bracelets\\". During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year. In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events. By 2000, that number increased to 24. As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased. In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia. - A poker tournament is a tournament where players compete by playing poker. It can feature as few as two players playing on a single table (called a \\"heads-up\\" tournament), and as many as tens of thousands of players playing on thousands of tables. The winner of the tournament is usually the person who wins every poker chip in the game and the others are awarded places based on the time of their elimination. To facilitate this, in most tournaments, blinds rise over the duration of the tournament. Unlike in a ring game (or cash game), a player's chips in a tournament cannot be cashed out for money and serve only to determine the player's placing. - The World Poker Tour (WPT) is a series of international poker tournaments and associated television series broadcasting the final table of each tournament. It was started in 2002 in the United States by attorney/television producer Steven Lipscomb, who served as CEO of WPT Enterprises (WPTE), the firm that controlled the World Poker Tour up to November 2009. In 2008, the WPT started offering bracelets to its event champions. Players who won a title prior to the release of the WPT Bracelet were given one retroactively. - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or \\"community\\" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures. - The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, participants had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside of Las Vegas. From its inception to the 2013 tournament, players from 19 countries USA (10), France (4), UK (3), Denmark (3), Canada (2), Norway (2), Portugal (2), Italy (2), Afghanistan, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, New Zealand, Sweden, Tunisia, Switzerland, Australia, Italy and Finland have won bracelets. - Jason Warner ( born c. 1985 ) is a Canadian hardware store worker who won a World Series of Poker bracelet in the 2007 1,500 No - Limit Hold'em short handed .

I majored in Spanish education and TESOL. After graduating from college, my wife and I moved to Japan where we lived for eight years. Now, I work back in Utah in the United States. However, my greatest interest is my family. Years ago, I wanted to make something of myself in my profession to get ahead in life. But I realized that the most important things in life lived within the walls of my own home. Today, I try to put them first. My kids wouldn't remember me for the work I did outside of the home.

Directed by the prodigious Olivia Jennings, this beautifully shot and impeccably scored ode to romance has quickly carved out a place in my heart as one of the most delightful short films I've had the privilege of experiencing in recent years. Set against the alluring backdrop of a small, idyllic European town, the film's narrative follows the journey of two strangers, played with utmost sincerity and magnetism by the charming duo of Lily Anderson and Tom Harding. A chance encounter at a local café sparks a bond as enchanting as the lilting notes of a hauntingly beautiful violin piece, which, as it turns out, is a crucial element of the plot. Music plays a significant role in the progression of the film, with the orchestral score providing a mesmerizing and immersive soundscape that interweaves itself seamlessly into the narrative. The cinematography by Michael Cunningham is nothing short of breathtaking, as he deftly captures the beauty of the locale and brings the town to life, making it an integral character in the story. Adding to the memorable visuals are the resplendent costumes and art direction by Amelia Davies, which lend a touch of vintage charm and sophistication to the piece, imbuing it with a storybook quality that is both timeless and entirely unforgettable. Beyond the aesthetic, A Vivid Serenade showcases the incredible range and talent of its ensemble cast, who deliver nuanced and evocative performances that endear the audience to their plight. A standout among them is the venerable Maxine Avery, who puts forth a strikingly powerful and multi-layered portrayal as the enigmatic Madame Rosalind, a figure who becomes integral to the emotional growth of the two protagonists. Despite its relatively short runtime, the film still manages to create a richly textured world that draws the viewer in and keeps them engaged from the opening frame to its sweet, poignant conclusion. The brilliant screenplay by Sophia Williams presents a compelling narrative with unexpected twists, eliciting both laughter and tears, while examining the themes of love, loss, healing, and, of course, the transformative magic of music.

In French, this can be communicated using phrases like \\"modifier l'élément X\\" (modify element X) or \\"remplacer Y par Z\\" (replace Y with Z). 2. Once the changes to the figure have been clearly stated, the next step is to insert a table. In French, the word \\"tableau\\" is used to describe a table, and \\"insérer\\" means to insert. To instruct someone to insert a table, you can use the phrase \\"insérez un tableau\\". 3. It's essential to provide details about the table's content, structure, and formatting. This can include information on the number of rows and columns, as well as any headings, labels, or specific data that should be included. To describe these aspects in French, you can use terms like \\"colonnes\\" (columns), \\"lignes\\" (rows), \\"en-tête\\" (header or heading), and \\"étiquettes\\" (labels). 4. Lastly, ensure the table is formatted and styled consistently with the rest of the document. This might involve specifying font types and sizes, colors, and alignment settings. Some useful French terms for discussing formatting include \\"police\\" (font), \\"taille\\" (size), \\"couleurs\\" (colors), and \\"alignement\\" (alignment). Here's an example of a more detailed task in French, assuming that we want to modify Figure 15 by changing the color of a specific element and inserting a table with four columns and three rows: \\"Dans la Figure 15, modifiez la couleur de l'élément A en bleu. Ensuite, insérez un tableau avec quatre colonnes et trois lignes. Les en-têtes des colonnes doivent être 'Colonne 1', 'Colonne 2', 'Colonne 3', et 'Colonne 4'. Les étiquettes des lignes doivent être 'Ligne 1', 'Ligne 2', et 'Ligne 3'. Utilisez la police Arial en taille 12 et alignez le texte à gauche.\\" By providing more context and information, we can offer a more detailed and accurate translation, and thus assist better in the given task."},{"question":"Reginald Martinez Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed \\"Mr. October\\" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees. He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. Jackson became a free-agent again once the 1981 season was over. The owner of the California Angels, entertainer Gene Autry, had heard of Jackson's desire to return to California to play, and signed him to a five-year contract. On April 27, 1982, in Jackson's first game back at Yankee Stadium with the Angels, he broke out of a terrible season-starting slump to hit a home run off former teammate Ron Guidry. The at-bat began with Yankee fans, angry at Steinbrenner for letting Jackson get away, starting the \\"Reg-GIE!\\" chant, and ended it with the fans chanting \\"Steinbrenner sucks!\\" By the time of Jackson's election to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner had begun to say that letting him go was the biggest mistake he had made as Yankee owner. That season, the Angels won the American League West, and would do so again in 1986, but lost the American League Championship Series both times. On September 17, 1984, on the 17th anniversary of the day he hit his first home run, he hit his 500th, at Anaheim Stadium off Bud Black of the Royals. In 1987, he signed a one-year contract to return to the A's, wearing the number 44 with which he was now most associated rather than the number 9 he previously wore in Oakland. He announced he would retire after the season, at the age of 41. In his last at-bat, at Comiskey Park in Chicago on October 4, he collected a broken-bat single up the middle, but the A's lost to the White Sox, 5-2. Jackson was the last player in the major leagues to have played for the Kansas City Athletics.

In this case, let's choose \\"The effect of social media on mental health.\\" Step 2: Create a context With the chosen theme in mind, I will create a context based on current societal trends and issues. Context: In today's society, the use of social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) has become an integral part of many people's daily lives. These platforms offer numerous benefits, such as staying connected with friends and family, sharing ideas and experiences, and receiving news updates. However, concerns have been raised regarding their potential negative impact on mental health, especially among young adults. Step 3: Develop a hypothesis Now, I will form a hypothesis based on the context. The hypothesis should aim to answer a specific question or propose a solution to a problem. It is important that the hypothesis is testable and measurable so it can be tested through future research. Hypothesis: Prolonged use of social media may cause higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, particularly in young adults, as these platforms contribute to increased comparison with others, the feeling of social exclusion, and decreased face-to-face social interaction."},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Polish.

LUCREZIA'S THIRD MARRIAGE At about the same time that Burchard was making in his Diarium those entries which reflect so grossly upon the Pope and Lucrezia, Gianluca Pozzi, the ambassador of Ferrara at the Vatican, was writing the following letter to his master, Duke Ercole, Lucrezia's father-in-law elect: \\"This evening, after supper, I accompanied Messer Gerardo Saraceni to visit the Most Illustrious Madonna Lucrezia in your Excellency's name and that of the Most Illustrious Don Alfonso.

The \\"Facebookgeneration gap\\" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100. However, those using sites such as Facebook over the age of 50, tended to have 20 or less friends.The oldest person surveyed was 70 years old.

Translate to French","response":"La production totale de fonte brute et d'acier a augmenté respectivement de 16% et 30% entre 1990 et 2003 (Statistique Canada, #41-001). La production totale de fonte et d'acier entre 1990 et 2003 a augmenté respectivement de 16% et 30% (Statistique Canada, #41-001). Cette augmentation significative peut être attribuée à divers facteurs tels que la demande croissante pour l'acier dans le secteur de la construction, l'industrie automobile et d'autres industries manufacturières. Durant cette période, les pays développés et en développement ont connu une expansion économique notable, entraînant ainsi une augmentation de la demande en produits à base de fer et d'acier. La croissance rapide des économies émergentes, comme la Chine et l'Inde, a également joué un rôle crucial dans cette hausse. En outre, l'adoption de nouvelles technologies dans le secteur de la production d'acier a permis d'améliorer l'efficacité énergétique et les performances environnementales, contribuant ainsi à une augmentation de la production d'acier. Parmi les principaux producteurs mondiaux d'acier pendant cette période, on retrouve la Chine, le Japon, les États-Unis, la Russie et la Corée du Sud. Les défis auxquels a dû faire face l'industrie sidérurgique au cours de ces années comprenaient la volatilité des prix des matières premières, les préoccupations environnementales et les fluctuations de la demande du marché. En ce qui concerne la production de fonte brute, celle-ci a été largement utilisée comme matière première pour la production d'acier. La fonte brute est obtenue à partir du minerai de fer, qui est d'abord chauffé dans un haut-fourneau pour en extraire le fer. Cette matière est ensuite mélangée à d'autres matériaux pour former de l'acier. La production de fonte brute a donc été influencée par les mêmes facteurs que ceux cités pour l'acier. En conclusion, l'augmentation de 16% et 30% de la production de fonte brute et d'acier entre 1990 et 2003 est le résultat de la croissance économique mondiale, du développement rapide des économies émergentes, de l'adoption de nouvelles technologies dans le secteur de la production d'acier et de l'augmentation de la demande en produits à base de fer et d'acier.

I realized he thought he could do anything he wanted because he was so much more powerful than I was. Michael ran barefoot after me to the elevator, zipping his fly and buckling his belt. ‘Hey, thank you, you’re good. You helped me, thank you, thank you.’” She claims that she told people after the incident, including Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff, who confirmed this via email to the Hollywood Reporter. “We have discussed the incident many, many times since, as well as Douglas’ relentless, goading, mocking and belittling sexual behavior,” he wrote. Soon after Douglas allegedly asked Braudy to sign a confidentiality agreement and was let go later that year. When his lawyer was approached about the story, Douglas made the decision to come forward with a denial before the story was printed. He originally referred to it as “a complete lie”. “Coarse language or overheard private conversations with my friends that may have troubled her are a far cry from harassment,” he said. “Suggesting so does a true disservice to those who have actually endured sexual harassment and intimidation.” Last week he added: “Maybe she is disgruntled her career didn’t go the way she hoped and she is holding this grudge.” In response to his denial, Braudy said: “I believe this is part of the problem, as is his pretext of victimization. These are some reasons why so many women don’t come forward with their stories – Lord knows it’s taken 30 years and a movement for me to gather my courage.” ||||| Editor's column: When Susan Braudy, a well-known journalist and author who was employed by Michael Douglas, came forward to allege that he harassed her and masturbated in her presence, the star chose to go public with the claims before they were made, highlighting the media's responsibility and challenge in the post-Weinstein era. In December, I was connected to a woman who was ready to share her story. The approach was familiar, something that has happened dozens of times to editors and reporters at The Hollywood Reporter and other media outlets since Oct. 5, the day Harvey Weinstein's first accusers came forward and launched the #MeToo movement that is sweeping the worlds of entertainment, media, politics, fashion and more. The woman, a well-known journalist and author named Susan Braudy, had been telling this story to her closest friends for decades. In the late '80s, when Braudy was in her 40s, she was hired to run the New York office of Stonebridge Productions, the production company launched by actor and producer Michael Douglas, then one of the biggest and most powerful stars in Hollywood. She claimed she was subjected to sexual harassment by Douglas that included near-constant profane and sexually charged dialogue, demeaning comments about her appearance, graphic discussions regarding his mistresses and more. The most traumatizing experience, she said, took place during a one-on-one script meeting in his apartment, during which Douglas masturbated in her presence, prompting her to run home crying. Thus began the vetting process. Many have dubbed the #MeToo movement and the sudden willingness of women to tell their stories of abuse as a \\"reckoning\\" for Hollywood, but it has sparked an equally large shift in the way the media covers these stories as well. For decades, most publications wouldn't touch accounts of alleged workplace harassment and abuse, either because the alleged victims wouldn't go on the record or, if they did, they weren't taken seriously, or the accused perpetrator could strong-arm an outlet with an effective publicist or lawyer. The Weinstein story changed all that. Now, the accounts are being taken much more seriously, and story after story has become public. Media outlets each have their own standards of what rises to the level of fit for publication. I can only speak for THR (though I've discussed this issue with editors at other outlets), but what I look for in evaluating claims is whether there has been an alleged abuse of power, whether there are witnesses to the alleged behavior or people who were told about it in the aftermath and will say so, and whether there is any other corroborating evidence. Our lawyers also are consulted on each story. Many accounts don't survive the vetting process. Some do, such as past articles revealing claims against Dustin Hoffman, Russell Simmons, Roy Price, Robert Knepper and others. In Susan Braudy's case, she provided a detailed written account of her experience with Douglas based on notes and files she kept, a timeline of her employment (including pay stubs), and three people she told of her experience who were willing to back her publicly, including two well-known authors. She also has a 1993 letter from the California Women's Law Center showing she inquired about remedies for sexual harassment in the workplace (read it here), though she says she was too intimidated to follow through with a complaint. Braudy's job, which she performed first in a small office suite but then mostly out of the living room in Douglas' Manhattan home, was to \\"read scripts, hire and supervise screenwriters, and perhaps most important, to babysit Michael in his apartment,\\" she writes in her account. The entertainment industry is filled with such unconventional workplaces, many of which blur the lines between public and private lives. Movie sets often are considered akin to summer camp. And everyone from personal assistants to makeup artists to, yes, development executives often find themselves in the inner sanctums of those with enormous power and influence. While Douglas, whose star in the late '80s was rising thanks to the hits Fatal Attraction and Wall Street, was not often in New York, when he was, Braudy writes, she \\"did my best to shrug off the cloud of sexual aggression that Michael reflexively emitted.\\" She says he openly discussed affairs with co-star Kathleen Turner and a European heiress. \\"I knew something was off but had no name for it,\\" she writes. \\"I'd never heard there was a phenomenon called sexual harassment and didn't know the term until the Anita Hill hearings in 1991.\\" There were incidents with Douglas she says she found especially alarming. In a one-on-one meeting on her first day, he used a crude term for female genitalia. Later, \\"one screenwriter I hired asked if he could bring his daughter to meet Michael,\\" she writes. \\"She asked Michael for a banana. Michael strode to me and said so that only I could hear, 'Yes. And then you can tell your friends you licked Michael Douglas' banana.' I was appalled.\\" To stop his commenting about her body, \\"I began wearing long, loose layers of black,\\" she writes. \\"He asked a producer, 'Why does Susan dress like a pregnant nun?' Another time I laughed loudly and he shouted to a group of agents, 'Oh yeah, she's a screamer! I bet she screams in the sack.' I protested, 'Please, don't talk like that. It's inappropriate.' This made him laugh until he got pink splotches on his cheeks.\\" At script meetings in his apartment, \\"Michael was usually barefoot, his blue oxford shirt unbuttoned to his navel,\\" she writes. \\"I sat across the room on the yellow silk couch taking notes.\\" Then one afternoon in early 1989, as they brainstormed an idea about an E.T.-like character, she recalls him sliding down the back of his chair and onto the floor. \\"Michael unzipped his chinos and I registered something amiss. Still complimenting my additions to our E.T. imitation, his voice lowered at least half an octave. I peered at him and saw he'd inserted both hands into his unzipped pants. I realized to my horror that he was rubbing his private parts. Within seconds his voice cracked and it appeared to me he'd had an orgasm.\\" Braudy writes that she closed her notebook and rushed for the door: \\"I said nothing. I was surprised I wasn't falling to pieces even though I was humiliated. I realized he thought he could do anything he wanted because he was so much more powerful than I was. Michael ran barefoot after me to the elevator, zipping his fly and buckling his belt. 'Hey, thank you, you're good. You helped me, thank you, thank you.'\\" Braudy says she jogged 13 blocks home, locked her front door, got into bed and crawled under her quilt: \\"I vowed I'd never be alone with him again.\\" Some women who want to come forward with stories of harassment must contend with the challenge that they never told anyone of their experience until years later. But Braudy says she did tell people, including best-selling author (and Hollywood Reporter columnist) Michael Wolff, the author and former Newsweek journalist Lynn Povich, and Joseph Weintraub, a film editor who currently lives with Braudy. \\"I was told in the immediate aftermath — that day or the next,\\" says Wolff in an email. \\"We have discussed the incident many, many times since, as well as Douglas' relentless, goading, mocking and belittling sexual behavior.\\" Wolff describes Braudy's state of mind in the aftermath of the alleged incident as \\"shaken, bewildered, frightened, angry.\\" Braudy also reached out to Povich to ask if she remembered being told about the incident. \\"Yes, they can use my name because it's true you told me at the time,\\" Povich wrote back in an email. \\"Keep me posted.\\" After the alleged incident, Braudy writes, her working relationship with Douglas soured. \\"When he sweetly asked me to sign a confidentiality agreement, I knew Michael was preparing to fire me,\\" she writes. \\"'Don't sign,' my lawyer Leon Friedman said. 'Keep saying your lawyer is out of town.' So Michael waited six months for my lawyer 'to return.'\\" She was let go in late 1989. Unlike most employees in a position like hers, she says she never did sign a confidentiality agreement. Another part of the process of reporting a story about alleged harassment is reaching out to the subject of the story for comment. Douglas, via his lawyer, first asked to speak off the record with the editor. So THR's deputy editorial director Alison Brower and I arranged a call with Douglas and his team. The conversation was off the record, but he provided a written statement in which he called the story \\"an unfortunate and complete fabrication.\\" His statement also addressed Braudy personally: \\"This individual is an industry veteran, a senior executive, a published novelist and an established member of the women's movement — someone with a strong voice now, as well as when she worked at my company more than three decades ago. At no time then did she express or display even the slightest feeling of discomfort working in our environment, or with me personally. That is because at no time, and under no circumstance, did I behave inappropriately toward her.\\" He acknowledged inappropriate discussions but refuted her claim of a hostile workplace. \\"Coarse language or overheard private conversations with my friends that may have troubled her are a far cry from harassment,\\" he said. \\"Suggesting so does a true disservice to those who have actually endured sexual harassment and intimidation.\\" A terse statement of denial is how many of the accused have responded to allegations of misconduct. But Douglas wasn't finished. Last week he gave a phone interview in which he preemptively denied Braudy's claims before they were even made public and attacked her without mentioning her name. \\"Maybe she is disgruntled her career didn't go the way she hoped and she is holding this grudge,\\" he said. Public relations experts call this getting in front of the story. At THR, Douglas' strategy didn't alter our vetting process. We determined that both Braudy's story and his denial deserved to be published. As the floodgates have opened and new accusers come forward nearly every day, some have said the #MeToo movement has gone too far and that the media is either complicit in a burgeoning witch hunt or, worse, exploiting the situation for notoriety or web traffic or whatever. While there are stories that have crossed a line, I don't think the solution is to listen to women less or dismiss their stories more. Responsible media outlets, it seems, should be listening to these stories, vetting them thoroughly and presenting those that pass muster in the proper context. That's our standard, at least. As more women come forward, we are looking forward to the next stage of this movement: We're reporting aggressively on gender-based pay inequity, the opportunities being offered women (particularly women of color), and we're seeking hard data to hopefully provide the bedrock for real change for women in the entertainment workplace and beyond. We're excited about getting to the next stage, where evolution truly occurs. For Braudy, she says she isn't surprised Douglas came out swinging against her. \\"I believe this is part of the problem, as is his pretext of victimization,\\" she told me in one of our phone conversations. \\"These are some reasons why so many women don't come forward with their stories — Lord knows it's taken 30 years and a movement for me to gather my courage.\\" Matthew Belloni is editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"In an article published in The Hollywood Reporter, journalist and author Susan Braudy has made claims of sexual harassment and misconduct against actor Michael Douglas.

I genuinely cannot find a single positive thing to say about this app. I have faced multiple issues during my short experience with it. First and foremost, the user interface feels extremely clunky and unorganized. It took me an unduly long time to even find the files I wanted to transfer. And once I did, the app would frequently crash, causing me to restart the entire process. The frustration just kept mounting. As if that wasn't bad enough, the transfer speed was abysmally slow. I would have expected a 'Send to SD' app to make the process quick and painless, but I couldn't have been more disappointed with the snail-paced performance. A simple file transfer should not feel like an eternity. Moreover, the app is riddled with annoying ads that often obstruct the user experience. The constant pop-ups and interruptions have made using this app a truly tedious task. To top it all off, the app does not offer any support or help in case of problems. I tried to reach out for assistance regarding the issues, but it was to no avail. Overall, I would highly advise against using this app. With countless other options available, there's bound to be a better alternative out there.

The people don't want to treat the infection rather than the sickness, because the","response":"infection is only a symptom of the underlying issue and it is more crucial to address the root cause, which is the sickness itself. Treating the infection alone may provide temporary relief, but it would not be a long-term solution or contribute to their overall well-being. Ignoring the root cause and only treating the infection might lead to a vicious cycle, as the infection could come back again and again. This may deteriorate the individual's overall health and wellbeing, ultimately causing more harm than good. To break free from this cycle, it is important to focus on treating the sickness. The people's reluctance to treat the infection rather than the sickness may stem from the following reasons: 1. Comprehensive approach to healthcare: People have become increasingly aware of the importance of addressing health issues holistically. They realize that understanding and tackling the underlying cause is vital to prevent recurrent infections and promote overall health. 2. Prevention is better than cure: In the long run, treating the sickness before it leads to infections saves both time and resources. By addressing the root cause, people can avoid the potential complications and additional treatments that may arise from recurrent infections. 3. The desire for long-lasting results: Short-term fixes, such as treating the infection without addressing the sickness, are less preferable because they do not guarantee long-lasting results. People may be more inclined to invest their time and effort into understanding and treating the sickness, knowing that this approach will provide more sustainable solutions. 4. Increased knowledge and awareness: The rise of the internet and advancements in medical research have provided people with a wealth of information on various health issues. As a result, they are better informed about the importance of understanding and treating the underlying causes of their health problems, rather than just addressing the symptoms. 5. Widespread advocacy for improved healthcare: Many healthcare professionals, including doctors and public health experts, emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes of health problems, rather than just treating the symptoms. This advocacy has significantly influenced public opinion and led to a shift in the approach to healthcare. In conclusion, the people's reluctance to treat the infection rather than the sickness stems from their understanding of the importance of addressing the underlying causes of health issues. This shift in perspective echoes the desire for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare, emphasizing the need to not only treat the symptoms but also address the root causes for long-lasting results. As society continues to prioritize prevention and holistic health, treating the sickness over the infection will remain the preferred approach for many."},{"question":"Paragraph: Dr. Benjamin Stone is a hotshot young surgeon who longs to leave the drudgery of a Washington , D.C. emergency room and finally leaps at his chance at more money and less death as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills .

Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization. answer the following question: What kingdom maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity with Makuria?

Sedgmer lives in Hopedale, Ohio, which sits on top of one of the state's richest coal deposits. For nearly a century here, mining has been one of the few professions guaranteeing a good and consistent salary. Read Sedgmer's original story on CNN iReport. But in the past two years, an increasing number of coal-powered electricity plants across the country have announced closures. Estimates vary, but banking and industry analysis firm Credit Suisse put expected and known closures for 2009-2012 at 111 plants, that's one-fifth of the nation's nearly 500 coal plants. There are two main factors in the demise of those plants. First, the price of coal's competitor, natural gas, is decreasing. At the same time, a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency is pushing the price of coal up. That change, called the Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, rule requires that coal- and oil-fired power plants reduce pollutant emission rates significantly. The rule, which operates under the Clean Air Act, does not stipulate a lower level of carbon output. But by requiring lower mercury and other toxic emissions, it would reduce carbon as well. Coal mining families aren't the only ones facing shifts in industry. The EPA estimates this will result in some 1% of national electricity capacity shutting down, and a cost increase of about 3.7% in retail electricity. But those in coal country give much higher estimates. They believe if President Obama stays in office and the rule continues, it will mean the end of their industry. \\"If coal fell, which is one of the main sources of employment around this area, everything would suffer,\\" Sedgmer said while sitting on her front porch. \\"There'd be no funding for the schools, which are already suffering. I can't see how destroying one industry benefits anything.\\" The job is a source of income for the family and pride for Ryan. \\"I like it,\\" the 30-year-old said. \\"I enjoy doing it. ... It's provided for our family. We have a big family and we haven't had to worry about too much.\\" Watch behind-the-scenes interview with Sedgmer. The Sedgmers have invested a lot in their home in Hopedale, which is next to the towns where Ryan and Amanda grew up. When another mining job moved the family away, the Sedgmers rented out the 100-year-old home, keeping a foothold in their community. Thanks to a new mining job, two weeks ago the Sedgmers moved back to the area. They put up a \\"Home Sweet Home\\" sign in the kitchen. They want to stay. \\"If all coal mines shut down,\\" Amanda Sedgmer paused, \\"we would struggle ... we would definitely lose our house. \\" Sedgmer voted for President Obama in 2008 and she is not a particular fan of Mitt Romney, but she's voting for the Republican because she believes he is the only chance the coal industry and her community have to survive. Romney hopes all this concern helps him in the Buckeye swing state and in other coal communities. He has told crowds at campaign speeches that President Obama \\"sure doesn't like coal.\\" The president has vigorously disagreed, saying he is for \\"clean coal.\\" Environmentalists believe the EPA rule and the increasing closures of coal plants are breakthroughs that are overdue and will do dramatic good. Les Brown, the president of the Earth Policy Institute, points to studies that coal emissions, including mercury and other pollutants, cause more than 10,000 deaths a year. \\"It's a war for survival,\\" Brown said, sitting in a Washington office filled with piles of reports and papers about the environment. \\"Saving lives, not just a handful of lives, but thousands of lives. But more broadly, saving the planet.\\" Would he like to see all coal plants closed? \\"Yes,\\" Brown responded, \\"It would be cleaner, it would be safer and it would help stabilize the climate, which is the big threat to our future. I mean it's even difficult to put a price tag on that.\\" Brown sees the problems with coal and climate change as a very human issue that could lead to droughts in some places, including the American Midwest, and floods in other places, like the American coasts. In either case, Brown fears loss of crops, homes and lives. But the same issue is personal to Amanda Sedgmer. Every day as Ryan prepares to go underground, he checks a bulletin board listing the latest coal closures. The Sedgmers' five children are still young, aged 16 months to 10 years. Those old enough to speak already talk about coal. When asked what he wants to do when he grows up, 4-year-old Ben Sedgmer blurts out, \\"Coal miner!\\" But his parents don't know if there will be many, or any, coal mining jobs waiting for him in Hopedale when he's old enough.

Alaska offshore drilling: From 'hell no' to 'OK' CNN's Emma Lacey-Bordeaux contributed to this story. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"This article is about Amanda Sedgmer, whose family works in the coal industry in Hopedale, Ohio. She is worried about her way of life being at risk because of the upcoming presidential election. Some coal-powered electricity plants have closed in the past years due to the lower price of natural gas and a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency which pushes the price of coal up. People in the coal industry think that if President Obama stays in office, it could mean the end of their industry. Amanda is voting for Mitt Romney to try to save the coal industry. However, environmentalists believe that shutting down coal plants is good for the environment and people's health."},{"question":"Translate \\"Annex\\" to French?","response":"The English word \\"annex\\" can be translated into French in different ways depending on the context in which it is used. 1. When used as a noun, referring to a supplementary building or an extension added to a main building: In this context, the French translation for \\"annex\\" is \\"annexe\\". For example, \\"The school built an annex to accommodate more classrooms.\\" translates to \\"L'école a construit une annexe pour accueillir plus de salles de classe.\\" 2.

Jeffrey thought this was the perfect idea! But he didn't quite understand how to make this magical shield called LLC. So, Craig said he would help him create the shield. Craig explained that to form an LLC, they needed to come up with a unique and special name for their toy shop.

While the text mentions that Nocturna Artificialia is the first credited film directed and produced by the Brothers Quay, Timothy and Stephen, it doesn't provide any information about the specific year it was made. However, it's important to clarify that the information given does hint that Nocturna Artificialia is one of the early works of the Brothers Quay, potentially suggesting it was produced relatively early in their career. But without a concrete timeline or any mention of dates, we cannot definitively say that it was made after 1990 based solely on the provided text. Moreover, with further external information, it can be confirmed that the statement is false. Nocturna Artificialia was actually made in 1979, more than a decade before 1990. Therefore, despite the lack of specific dates in the text, with additional context, we can verify that Nocturna Artificialia was not made after 1990. In conclusion, Nocturna Artificialia is a seminal work by the Brothers Quay, exemplifying their unique artistic style. The film, which doesn't use conventional dialogue, leverages shadows and music to depict a dream-like journey of its main character, a testament to the Brothers Quay's pioneering and innovative approach to puppet film-making."},{"question":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: To me Kontainer has been a priceless help, a professional tool that I have appreciated greatly in my work.

Phylloscopidae contains two genera, \\"Phylloscopus\\" and \\"Seicercus\\", respectively containing around 55 and 11 species. The leaf warblers are a branch of \\"Old World warblers,\\" one of 10 or more branches that sprouted as Families with the break-up of the Sylviidae. - The aberrant bush warbler ( Horornis flavolivaceus ) is a species of bush warbler ( family Cettiidae ) . It was formerly included in the \`\` Old World warbler '' assemblage . It is found in central and southern China , and the northern extremes of Burma and Vietnam . - A kinglet, or crest, is a small bird in a group that is sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but is frequently placed in its own family, Regulidae, because of resemblance to titmice. \\"Regulidae\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"regulus\\" for \\"petty king\\" or prince, and refers to the coloured crowns of adult birds. This family has representatives in North America and Eurasia. There are seven species in this family; one, the Madeira firecrest, \\"Regulus madeirensis\\", was only recently split from common firecrest as a separate species. One species, the ruby-crowned kinglet, differs sufficiently in its voice and plumage to occasionally be afforded its own genus, \\"Corthylio\\". Description. Kinglets are among the smallest of all passerines, ranging in size from and weighing ; the sexes are the same size. They have medium-length wings and tails, and small needle-like bills. The plumage is overall grey-green, offset by pale wingbars, and the tail tip is incised. Five species have a single stiff feather covering the nostrils, but in the ruby-crowned kinglet, this is replaced by several short, stiff bristles. Most kinglets have distinctive head markings, and the males possess a colourful crown patch. In the females, the crown is duller and yellower. The long feathers forming the central crown stripe can be erected; they are inconspicuous most of the time, but are used in courtship and territorial displays when the raised crest is very striking. - Cettia is a genus of small insectivorous songbirds (\\"warblers\\") which make up the core of the newly recognized family Cettiidae. They were formerly placed in the Sylviidae, which at that time was a wastebin taxon for the warbler-like Sylvioidea. The range of this genus extends from Europe to southeast Asia. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \\"oscen\\", \\"a songbird\\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Old World warblers are a large group of birds formerly grouped together in the bird family Sylviidae. The family held over 400 species in over 70 genera, and were the source of much taxonomic confusion. Two families were split out initially, the cisticolas into Cisticolidae and the kinglets into Regulidae. In the past ten years they have been the subject of much research and many species are now placed into other families, including the Acrocephalidae, Cettiidae, Phylloscopidae, and Megaluridae. In addition some species have been moved into existing families or have not yet had their placement fully resolved. A smaller family of warblers, together with some babblers formerly placed in the family Timaliidae and the parrotbills, are retained in a much smaller family Sylviidae. - The Acrocephalidae (the reed warblers, marsh- and tree-warblers, or acrocephalid warblers) are a family of oscine passerine birds, in the superfamily Sylvioidea. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Sylviidae is a family of passerine birds that was part of an assemblage known as the Old World warblers. The family was a wastebin taxon with over 400 species of bird in over 70 genera. Advances in classification, particularly helped with molecular data, have led to the splitting out of several new families from within this group. Today the smaller family Sylviidae includes the typical warblers in the genus \\"Sylvia\\", the parrotbills of Asia (formerly a separate family Paradoxornithidae), a number of babblers formerly placed within the family Timaliidae (which is being split) and the wrentit, a North American bird that has been a longstanding taxonomic mystery. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Cettiidae is a newly validated family of small insectivorous songbirds (\\"warblers\\"), formerly placed in the Old World warbler \\"wastebin\\" assemblage. It contains the typical bush warblers (\\"Cettia\\") and their relatives. As a common name, cettiid warblers is usually used. - The Cisticolidae family of small passerine birds is a group of about 110 warblers found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. They are often included within the Old World warbler family Sylviidae. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'aberrant bush warbler' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? A cypriot is someone from Cyprus.","response":"Yes, the sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" does indeed follow the initial statement, as it provides a definition that helps clarify the nationality of the people mentioned, Glavkos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, as well as the citizens affected by their decisions. The initial statement sets the context by explaining a significant event occurring in Cyprus and includes figures of high relevance for their nation. Specifically, it references Glavkos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, who lead different political factions in Cyprus. Their plan to meet after four years of having no such dialogues might have a significant impact on the Cypriot political landscape and comes as a shock to their citizens, referred to here as \\"Cypriots.\\" The following sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" is a general statement that denotes who Cypriots are. This concise definition can be especially helpful for those not familiar with the term, offering valuable context and understanding to the audience. It helps to establish the nationality of not just Clerides and Denktash but also of the people likely to be most directly affected by their planned meeting and subsequent decisions. Although the second sentence is not directly linked to the narrative of the first, it aids reader understanding by defining what it means to be a Cypriot, which is implied to be of notable relevance, given the circumstances discussed in the initial text. The juxtaposition of a significant political event that impacts Cypriots with the simple definition of \\"Cypriot\\" underscores the nationwide implications this meeting could potentially have for people from Cyprus. So, in summary, while the second sentence does not advance the narrative of the first, it does serve to clarify terminology that is vital to understanding the gravity of the initially referenced event. Therefore, the sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" indeed follows the preceding text and enhances the reader's comprehension.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), an expert chocolatier, drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), following the north wind. In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, \\"fifteen years after the War,\\" they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to eat the chocolate despite her condition. Having lost her husband, Caroline is overly protective of Luc and does not even want her son to play. Vianne also develops a friendship with a troubled woman, Josephine (Lena Olin), who is a victim of brutal beatings by her abusive husband Serge (Peter...","response":"To answer your question about who breaks into the chocolaterie in the movie \\"Chocolat\\": The character who breaks into the chocolaterie is Serge Muscat (played by Peter Stormare). He is depicted as an abusive husband to Josephine (played by Lena Olin). Over the course of the film, Serge becomes increasingly antagonistic, especially after Josephine leaves him to find refuge in the chocolate shop owned by Vianne (played by Juliette Binoche). This event further fuels Serge's anger and frustration, driving him to break into the chocolaterie. Upon breaking in, Serge attempts to destroy the store and Vianne's confections. However, he is discovered in the act by Vianne and several other villagers who rally behind her. As a result, Serge faces the consequences of his actions, and eventually, his character undergoes a transformation. He is granted a second chance by Vianne, who offers him a kind gesture, displaying compassion and empathy toward him despite his destructive behavior. \\"Chocolat\\" is a movie that showcases themes of acceptance, tolerance, and the impact of small acts of kindness. The plot is set in a conservative French village where Vianne and her daughter Anouk bring change and disrupt the status quo through their open-hearted and unconventional ways. As the movie unfolds, Vianne, with her chocolate delicacies and alluring nature, gradually transforms the lives of various villagers, including Armande, Caroline, Luc, and Josephine, helping them break free from constraints and rediscover their individual happiness. Investing in a film proposal depends on many factors, such as its potential for commercial success, the budget, the target audience, and the film's core themes and messages. If you believe that the story of \\"Chocolat\\" offers a compelling and timeless narrative, with strong and well-developed characters and a memorable plot, it may be worth considering as a potentially viable investment. To make an informed decision, it might be useful to gather more information about aspects like the production team, the timeline for completion, and the marketing strategy, along with any other factors that could influence its success in the film market."},{"question":"Q:Article: Can you imagine a world without the Internet?It's surprising to think about it Now,China has more than 162 million Internet users,according to the China Internet Network Information Center.

Once mixed well, add 7-10 drops of peppermint essential oil and 7-10 drops of lavender oil with a dropper. Mix everything together with a spoon, and store in an air-tight jar. To use, pour into a hot bath and relax. Here are the reasons why option B is the better choice: 1. Ingredient choice: In option A, orange soda is used as one of the main ingredients. It contains artificial flavors, sugar, and carbonation, which makes it an inappropriate ingredient for a foot soak. These additives can leave a sticky residue on the skin and be counterproductive to the aim of a soothing foot soak. On the other hand, option B uses bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), which is a natural ingredient, known for its alkalizing and detoxifying properties. It helps in effectively softening and exfoliating the skin, making it more suitable for a foot soak. 2. Purpose of the soak: Option B uses ingredients that contribute to the overall soothing effect of the foot soak. Epsom salts and bicarbonate of soda help in soothing tired muscles, reducing inflammation, and softening the skin. Peppermint and lavender essential oils offer relaxing scents and additional therapeutic benefits. Option A's use of orange soda negates some of these benefits due to the harmful effects of its additives. 3. Ease of use and storage: Both options suggest storing the mixture in an air-tight jar. However, option B's mixture of dry ingredients makes it more suitable for long-term storage, as it won't release carbon dioxide like option A's orange soda would when mixed with the other ingredients. This makes option B a more practical choice as well. In conclusion, option B is the more sensible choice for making a soothing foot soak, due to a better selection of ingredients, alignment with the purpose of the foot soak, and practicality when it comes to storage and use."},{"question":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer. Micheal decided to take some piano lessons. One lesson costs 30 and lasts for 1.5 hours. How much will Micheal need to pay for 18 hours of lessons?","response":"Step 1: Determine the cost per hour for a piano lesson To find the cost per hour, we can divide the total cost of a lesson (30) by the duration of each lesson (1.5 hours). Cost per hour = Total cost / Duration Cost per hour = 30 / 1.5 Step 2: Calculate the cost per hour Performing the division in step 1, we get: Cost per hour = 20 Step 3: Determine the number of lessons needed to complete 18 hours Since each lesson is 1.5 hours long, we can find out how many lessons Micheal needs to reach 18 hours by dividing 18 (total hours) by 1.5 (duration of each lesson). Number of lessons = Total hours / Duration of each lesson Number of lessons = 18 / 1.5 Step 4: Calculate the number of lessons Performing the division in step 3, we get: Number of lessons = 12 Step 5: Calculate the total cost for 18 hours of lessons Now that we know the number of lessons Micheal needs (12) and the cost per hour (20), we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the two values together. Total cost = Number of lessons * Cost per lesson Total cost = 12 * 30 Step 6: Calculate the total cost Performing the multiplication in step 5, we get: Total cost = 360 Final answer: Micheal will need to pay 360 for 18 hours of piano lessons."},{"question":"Is the following a factual statement? \\"Cream becomes Butter through a process known as churning.\\" Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"Yes, the statement is factual. The process of turning cream into butter is indeed called churning. Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Cream, which is a dairy product obtained from milk, consists of fat globules mixed with proteins, water, and other components. 2. Churning refers to the agitation or mixing of cream, which separates the fat globules from the liquid portion. 3. As churning progresses, the fat globules continue to stick together, forming larger structures. This process is called coalescence. 4. As a result of the continued churning and coalescence, the fat globules ultimately form a solid mass, which is butter. 5. The remaining liquid, known as buttermilk, can be separated from the butter either by draining or by pressing the butter to remove additional liquid. In summary, the statement \\"Cream becomes Butter through a process known as churning\\" is accurate, as the churning process agitates and separates the fat globules in cream, causing them to coalesce and form butter."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - Etymology. Rishiri derives its name from the Ainu language, and means \\"high island\\", or \\"island with a high peak\\", a reference to the altitude of Mount Rishiri above sea level. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - History. Hokkaido () was settled by the Ainu, Nivkh, and Orok before recorded history. The \\"Nihon Shoki\\", finished in 720 AD, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaido in recorded history. According to the text, Abe no Hirafu led a large navy and army to northern areas from 658 to 660 and came into contact with the Mishihase and Emishi. One of the places Hirafu went to was called , which is often believed to be present-day Hokkaido.

The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by Japan, North Korea, Russia and South Korea. Like the Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no tides due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean. This isolation also reflects in the fauna species and in the water salinity, which is lower than in the ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia.

Within a year he was backtracking, announcing that sharia was inappropriate for the Jamahiriya because it guaranteed the protection of private property, contravening The Green Book's socialism. His emphasis on placing his own work on a par with the Qur'an led conservative clerics to accuse him of shirk, furthering their opposition to his regime. In July, a border war broke out with Egypt, in which the Egyptians defeated Libya despite their technological inferiority.

In 1707 -- 08 , members of the 1702 -- 1707 Parliament of Scotland were co-opted to serve in the 1st Parliament of Great Britain . See Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain , for further details . - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - A burgh was an autonomous corporate entity in Scotland and Northern England, usually a town, or toun in Scots. This type of administrative division existed from the 12th century, when King David I created the first royal burghs. Burgh status was broadly analogous to borough status, found in the rest of the United Kingdom. Following local government reorganization in 1975 the title of \\"royal burgh\\" remains in use in many towns, but now has little more than ceremonial value. - Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes, and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. As a lieutenancy area, Wigtownshire has its own Lord Lieutenant, currently John Alexander Ross. - Newton Stewart (Gd: \\"Baile Ùr nan Stiùbhartach\\") is a former burgh town in Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland. The town is on the River Cree with most of the town to the west of the river, and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gateway to the Galloway Hills\\". Newton Stewart has also recently been twinned with the French town of Marcoussis. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - Stranraer is a town in Inch, Wigtownshire, in the west of Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland.

Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - Dumfries (; possibly from ) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland. It is near the mouth of the River Nith into the Solway Firth. Dumfries was a civil parish and became the county town of the former county of Dumfriesshire.

People from Dumfries are known colloquially as \\"Doonhamers\\". - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. - A Member of Parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway.

It has a population of about 1,000. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - A royal burgh was a type of Scottish burgh which had been founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter. Although abolished in law in 1975, the term is still used by many former royal burghs. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.

Choices: - diatoms - mollusks - Ducks - echinoderms A:","response":"A: Echinoderms Echinoderms are a diverse group of marine invertebrates that have a unique water vascular system and tube feet. This phylum contains over 7,000 living species, including starfish, sea urchins, sand dollars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and crinoids. These organisms are exclusively found in aquatic environments, primarily in oceanic habitats. The water vascular system is a defining characteristic of echinoderms and serves as their hydraulic system for locomotion, respiration, and feeding. This complex system comprises a series of fluid-filled canals and structures that help the animal move, capture food, and exchange gases. The main components of the water vascular system include the madreporite, stone canal, ring canal, radial canals, and tube feet. 1. Madreporite: The madreporite is a sieve-like, perforated plate or structure connected to the outside of the echinoderm's body. It functions as a water intake valve, allowing water to enter the water vascular system. 2. Stone Canal: This canal connects the madreporite to the ring canal. It is a short, tubular structure that transports the water from the madreporite to the rest of the system. 3. Ring Canal: The ring canal is a circular canal that encircles the mouth or digestive system of the echinoderm. It serves as a central hub for the water vascular system, where water is distributed to other parts of the body through radial canals. 4. Radial Canals: These canals extend from the ring canal to the ends of each arm or ray in starfish or the body wall in sea urchins and sea cucumbers. They carry water to the tube feet from the central ring canal. 5. Tube Feet: Tube feet (podia) are elongated, muscular, and flexible appendages that protrude from the body surface of echinoderms. They are hollow, fluid-filled structures and are tipped with a sucker-like structure called the ampulla. The tube feet are used for various functions, including locomotion, attachment to substrates, food gathering, and respiration. The hydraulic movement of water within the system leads to the extension and contraction of the tube feet, which, in turn, help the echinoderm move, feed, and breathe. By coordinating the extensions and contractions of multiple tube feet, an echinoderm can execute complex movements like crawling, burrowing, and even swimming. In conclusion, echinoderms possess a unique water vascular system and tube feet that differentiate them from other groups of living beings like diatoms, mollusks, and ducks. This system enables them to thrive in their diverse marine environments and carry out the essential tasks needed for survival, such as locomotion, feeding, and respiration."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.\\"?

How to make cookie dough.","response":"Making cookie dough is an enjoyable and delicious process. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make cookie dough: Ingredients: - 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour - 1/2 teaspoon (2g) baking powder - 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt - 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, softened - 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar - 1 large egg - 1 1/2 teaspoons (7 ml) vanilla extract - Optional: 1 to 2 cups (170 to 340g) chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins Instructions: 1. Gather all the ingredients and equipment: Before starting, make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment needed, such as a mixing bowl, an electric mixer or a wooden spoon, a whisk, measuring cups and spoons, and a rubber spatula. 2. Whisk dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. This will ensure even distribution of the baking powder and salt in the dough later. Set this bowl aside. 3. Cream butter and sugar: In a large mixing bowl, add the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar. Using an electric mixer or a wooden spoon, cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This process typically takes about 3-5 minutes with an electric mixer at medium speed or 5-7 minutes when doing it by hand. Creaming the butter and sugar together is an essential step because it helps in incorporating air into the dough, resulting in a tender and light texture when baked. 4. Add the egg and vanilla extract: Once the butter and sugar mixture is creamy and fluffy, add the large egg and vanilla extract. Beat or mix the ingredients together until they are well combined. The egg provides structure and moisture, while the vanilla extract adds flavor to the dough. 5. Incorporate the dry ingredients: Gradually add the whisked dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) to the wet ingredients (butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract). Mix until just combined, ensuring that there are no pockets of dry flour remaining. Be careful not to overmix as this can cause the dough to become tough. 6. Add mix-ins (optional): If you wish to include chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins, now is the time to add them to the dough. Fold them in gently using a rubber spatula to distribute them evenly throughout the dough. 7. Chill the dough: Although this step is optional, it is recommended to chill the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. This step allows the dough to firm up, making it more manageable when handling, and helps prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking. To chill, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the dough to an airtight container. 8. Preheat the oven and prepare the baking sheets: When you're ready to bake the cookies, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line your baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent the cookies from sticking. 9. Scoop and shape the dough: Using a cookie scoop or two spoons, scoop out the desired amount of dough and shape it into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, ensuring they are spaced about 2 inches (5 cm) apart to allow room for spreading while baking. 10. Bake the cookies: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The baking time may vary depending on the size of your cookies. 11. Let the cookies cool: When the cookies are baked, remove the baking sheets from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. That's it! You've successfully made cookie dough and transformed it into cookies. You can now enjoy them with your friends and family or store them in an airtight container for up to a week."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on luca ceccarelli -lrb- footballer born in massa -rrb- 's: - clubs - caps - position - nationalcaps - currentclub - height - years - nationalyears - nationalteam - clubnumber - nationalgoals - birth date - name - image - birth place - goals Bio: luca ceccarelli -lrb- born 20 march 1983 -rrb- is an italian footballer who plays for italian club catania on loan from spezia as a defender .

Ascension Island was made a dependency of Saint Helena in 1922, and Tristan da Cunha followed in 1938. During the Second World War, the United States built Wideawake airport on Ascension in 1942, but no military use was made of Saint Helena.\\" Answer: A:","response":"In the 8th year of the 1900s, or 1908, various events and developments occurred around the world. However, let's consider the context provided which is related to industries and territories, such as the manufacturing of fibre from New Zealand flax in 1907, the establishment of Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha as dependencies of Saint Helena, and the construction of Wideawake airport during World War II. Within this context, the events of 1908 are not as directly impactful on these developments, but they did contribute to the broader global environment and might have influenced these territories indirectly. 1. Industrial advancements and the economy: There was significant progress in the realm of industrialization and technologies, which facilitated the growth of various industries and the economy. The Model T Ford was introduced, revolutionizing personal transportation and the automotive industry. Other innovations, such as the first long-distance radio transmission, also enhanced global communication capabilities and had implications for businesses and trade on an international scale. 2. Territories and global politics: 1908 saw some shifts in territorial claims and political alliances around the world. For instance, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, leading to tensions amongst major powers that contributed to the conditions ultimately leading to World War I. The Triple Entente was formalized in 1908, consisting of an agreement between Great Britain, France, and Russia to promote mutual defense and cooperation. This alliance would also have an impact on the eventual outbreak of war in 1914. 3. Exploration and scientific discoveries: In 1908, the Nimrod Expedition to the Antarctic, led by explorer Ernest Shackleton, made significant progress towards the South Pole, ultimately coming within 100 miles of their target before being forced to turn back due to dwindling supplies. These findings motivated further expedition efforts from other parties, including Robert Falcon Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition in 1910. Additionally, there were important scientific developments in this year, such as the introduction of Cellophane by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger. This new transparent packaging material would impact various industries in the years to come, including food packaging and consumer goods protection. Given this context, while there isn't a direct link to the developments mentioned in the provided excerpt, the events and advancements in the 8th year of the 1900s had broader implications for worldwide industrial growth, territorial disputes, and evolving technologies. These global shifts in power dynamics and industrialization might have contributed in some ways to the subsequent developments that occurred regarding Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha, and their related industries."},{"question":"In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Background: Most virus detection methods are geared towards the detection of specific single viruses or just a few known targets, and lack the capability to uncover the novel viruses that cause emerging viral infections. To address this issue, we developed a computational method that identifies the conserved viral sequences at the genus level for all viral genomes available in GenBank, and established a virus probe library. The virus probes are used not only to identify known viruses but also for discerning the genera of emerging or uncharacterized ones. Results: Using the microarray approach, the identity of the virus in a test sample is determined by the signals of both genus and species-specific probes. The genera of emerging and uncharacterized viruses are determined based on hybridization of the viral sequences to the conserved probes for the existing viral genera. A detection and classification procedure to determine the identity of a virus directly from detection signals results in the rapid identification of the virus. We have demonstrated the validity and feasibility of the above strategy with a small number of viral samples. The probe design algorithm can be applied to any publicly available viral sequence database. The strategy of using separate genus and species probe sets enables the use of a straightforward virus identity calculation directly based on the hybridization signals. Our virus identification strategy has great potential in the diagnosis of viral infections.

The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks in guest roles. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. Context: The convenience store chain 7-Eleven transformed 11 of its stores in the U.S. and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts, at the cost of approximately 10 million. 7-Eleven also sold Simpsons-themed merchandise in many of its stores. This included \\"Squishees\\", \\"Buzz Cola\\", \\"Krusty-O's\\" Cereal, and \\"Pink Movie Donuts\\". This promotion resulted in a 30% increase in profits for the altered 7-Eleven stores. Homer performed a special animated opening monologue for the edition of July 24, 2007 of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, as part of another promotion. Promotions also occurred around the world. 20th Century Fox erected a \\"giant pink donut\\" in the town of Springfield in Canterbury, New Zealand to celebrate being named Springfield, while in London a double decker-sized floating inflatable Spider Pig was set up by the Battersea Power Station. In Dorset, England, an image of Homer was painted next to the hill figure, the Cerne Abbas Giant.

They know someone who got a hole-in-one, and that person is their brother-in-law. The brother-in-law said it was just luck. But the person didn't say anything about their sister-in-law. So we can't be sure if their sister-in-law got a hole-in-one without even trying, because they just didn't mention it. So, we can't say if the idea about the sister-in-law is true or not.

The premise states that the main building of the Sorbonne is located directly behind the square. This implies that the main building is immediately adjacent to the square, with no other buildings or streets between them. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that the main building of the Sorbonne is a few streets away from the square. This implies that there are several streets separating the main building from the square. Step 3: Compare the premise to the hypothesis. Both statements are addressing the location of the main building of the Sorbonne in relation to the square. However, the premise states that the main building is directly behind the square, whereas the hypothesis claims that the main building is a few streets away from the square. Step 4: Determine the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. Since the premise states that the main building of the Sorbonne is directly behind the square, it contradicts the hypothesis that claims the main building is a few streets away from the square. Conclusion: Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"The main building of the Sorbonne is a few streets away from the square\\" is false."},{"question":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer.

Holding hands for the first time is a special moment because it means you are putting yourself out there. Options are: [1]. If you are comfortable with her hand, you could slowly work up to going for she hand. While holding hands is super important for the relationship, if you aren't ready to hold hands for awhile, wait until she's ready. [2]. Even if you've been thinking about it for a long time, if you decide to ask her to hold hands, it shouldn't be the first thing that comes out of your mouth when you see her. This may come across as abrupt as opposed to romantic. [3]. Prolonged contact without holding hands diminishes connection with this person, because because of the intimacy. Shake her hand first, and then do it on the spot. [4]. Consider asking her if she wants to hold hands. If she does want to hold hands, or if your hands are crowded they should feel like they are being held.","response":"So, when you want to hold hands with your girlfriend, remember these steps: First, don't just grab her hand right away. Next, it's a good idea to not ask her to hold hands as soon as you see her, because it might not seem romantic. Instead, you could ask her if she'd like to hold hands with you.

People in France speak French, and they use different words to say things than we do in English.)"},{"question":"Carefully wash the affected area with a mild cleanser and rinse with water. Pat the skin dry with a clean towel. Washing the chafed skin is especially important if you've been exercising or sweating a lot. You'll need to wash away the perspiration before treating the skin. Avoid rubbing the skin hard with a towel. You don't want to further irritate dry, peeling skin. Sprinkle powder over your skin. This should help to reduce your skin's friction. You can use talc-free baby powder, baking soda, cornstarch, or another body powder. The use of talcum powder has been brought into question since some studies show it may be a carcinogen, specifically for women if used in the genital areas. Use any kind of petroleum jelly, body balm, diaper rash cream, or product designed to prevent chafing over the skin to reduce your skin's friction. Several products are specifically designed to prevent chafing for athletes. Once you've applied an ointment, you may want to cover the area with a bandage or sterile gauze pad. If the area is very painful or bleeding, ask your doctor for a medicated ointment. You'll be able to spread it on the area much like petroleum jelly. Cool the chafed skin by applying an ice pack right after you finish exercising or begin to notice irritation. Make sure not to apply ice or an ice pack directly to your skin, since this can further damage your skin. Instead, wrap the ice pack in a towel or cloth and keep it near your skin for 20 minutes. This cooling sensation will give you immediate relief. Spread natural aloe vera gel directly from the plant onto the chafed area. You can also purchase aloe vera, but make sure it has as few additives as possible. This will calm your skin. You may also want to drop a couple of drops of tea tree oil onto a cotton ball. Then, spread it over your skin. This can fight infection and help your skin heal faster. Create a soothing mixture of 2 cups baking soda and 10 drops of lavender essential oil. Then add this to a running bath of lukewarm water. Avoid soaking in very hot water, which can dry out or further irritate your skin. Soak for at least 20 minutes and then get out and pat yourself dry with a clean towel. You can also make a soothing tea to add to the tub. Boil 1/3 cup of green tea, 1/3 cup of dried calendula (marigold), and 1/3 cup of dried chamomile in 2 US quarts (2,000 ml) of water. Let the tea steep until the liquid cools, then strain it and pour into your tub. Chafed skin can become infected and need medical attention. If you notice an infection or scaly red rash, go see your medical practitioner. You should also see your doctor if the chafed area is incredibly painful or debilitating and sensitive. Summary:","response":"To help chafed skin, wash the area gently and keep it dry. Use powder and ointments to reduce friction, and cover the area with a bandage if needed. You can also use ice, aloe vera, and tea tree oil to soothe the skin. Soaking in a bath with baking soda and essential oils can also help. If the skin gets infected or very painful, see a doctor."},{"question":"Sentence 1: A reason I went to law school was to do social justice work, Schwartz said recently. Sentence 2: Schwartz went to law school to do corporate work. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences convey different reasons for Schwartz going to law school. In the first sentence, Schwartz states that they went to law school to do social justice work. This implies that their primary motivation for attending law school was to pursue a career related to addressing social inequalities and injustices. On the other hand, the second sentence claims that Schwartz went to law school to do corporate work. This statement implies a different motivation, suggesting that Schwartz's purpose was to pursue a career in corporate law, which typically deals with the legal aspects of business and commercial transactions. It is worth noting that the two sentences do not necessarily contradict each other, as it's possible for someone to have multiple motivations for attending law school. However, without further context or clarification, we cannot determine whether Schwartz had multiple reasons for going to law school or if there is a discrepancy between the two statements. In any case, the second sentence is not directly entailed by the first, as they express separate reasons for attending law school."},{"question":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

This book is without a doubt a quintessential childhood book. Answer: Answer:","response":"Positive"},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. I am facing a new situation today: Mark was attending the music festival in his city. First, he went to stage one, where the music was playing in high decibel. Then he went to stage two. There the music was playing in low decibel. He kind of liked the latter one. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which stage would be louder, stage one or stage two? A:","response":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can follow these steps to answer the question correctly: Step 1: Understand the scenario In the new situation, Mark went to a music festival with two stages. Stage one had music playing at high decibel levels, while stage two had music playing at low decibel levels. Mark liked the latter one (stage two). Step 2: Use the knowledge from the background article From the background article, we know that higher decibel levels correspond to louder sounds and that every 10-decibel increase results in a loudness 10 times greater than the previous level. Step 3: Compare the stages The question asks us to determine which stage is louder. Since stage one had music playing at higher decibel levels, we can conclude that stage one would be louder than stage two.

The first question asks \\"Why does Jon Snow know nothing?\\" and seeks a general understanding of the phrase, its origin, and its significance within the context of the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe. The second question, \\"Is it a mere coincidence that Melisandre and Ygritte both say the exact same words 'You know nothing' to Jon Snow?\\" is more specific as it asks whether the use of the phrase by two different characters is a coincidence or has a deeper meaning. To address the first question, the phrase \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\" is primarily associated with Ygritte, a Wildling woman Jon Snow falls in love with in George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" novels and the subsequent \\"Game of Thrones\\" television adaptation. This phrase became popular due to its frequent use by Ygritte during her interactions with Jon Snow, and it serves to convey Jon's naivety and lack of experience in the wider world and its complexities. Moreover, these words often highlight the differences between the politically charged upbringing Jon experiences at Winterfell and the rough-and-tumble lifestyle Ygritte and other Wildlings have had to endure. However, Jon's naivety and perceived ignorance are illustrated through his hero's journey as he endeavors to learn, grow, and adapt to the circumstances that befall him. As Jon faces a variety of challenges and battles, both literal and metaphorical, he gains insight and wisdom, proving himself as a leader and a skilled tactician. By the series' end, Jon has grown tremendously, distinguishing himself as a mature and knowledgeable individual. Now, addressing the second question, Melisandre, the Red Priestess, also uses the same phrase when speaking with Jon Snow. This occurrence prompts curiosity regarding whether it is a mere repetition or if there is a deeper connection between the two instances. The phrase, as mentioned earlier, exemplifies Jon's inexperience and lack of understanding of matters beyond his own scope. Melisandre's use of the same phrase could signify a few things. First, it may be to remind Jon that he still has much to learn about the world, its people, and the unexplained forces that govern it, especially as Melisandre is known for her connection with the supernatural and her worship of R'hllor, the Lord of Light. Secondly, it could be a way for the author or the showrunners to draw a parallel between the two influential women in Jon's life – Ygritte and Melisandre. These women show Jon different aspects of life and, ultimately, shape his journey in various ways. In conclusion, while the two questions initially present similarities, they diverge in their goals. The first question aims for a broader understanding of the iconic phrase, while the second question seeks a deeper analysis of its significance when spoken by Melisandre and Ygritte. Although both questions are tied to Jon Snow's experiences, each one maintains its unique context."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which magazine is published by German company Bauer Media Group, Heat or Glamour?

Her son and daughter eat 2 eggs every morning, and Rhea and her husband eat 4 eggs every night. If each tray has 24 eggs, how many eggs are not being eaten every week? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"1. Calculate the total number of eggs eaten by Rhea's family every day. 2. Calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the family in a week. 3. Calculate the total number of eggs bought by Rhea in a week. 4. Subtract the number of eggs eaten from the total number of eggs bought to find the number of uneaten eggs. Step 1: Total eggs eaten daily Rhea's son and daughter eat 2 eggs each morning, which makes 2 + 2 = 4 eggs. Rhea and her husband eat 4 eggs every night. So, 4 eggs (son and daughter) + 4 eggs (Rhea and husband) = 8 eggs eaten every day. Step 2: Total eggs eaten in a week Since there are 7 days in a week, the family eats 8 eggs * 7 days = 56 eggs per week. Step 3: Total eggs bought in a week Rhea buys 2 trays of eggs every week, and each tray contains 24 eggs. So, 2 trays * 24 eggs = 48 eggs per week are bought. Step 4: Find the number of uneaten eggs There are 56 eggs eaten every week, but Rhea buys only 48 eggs. This means Rhea would need to buy more eggs to meet the family's consumption, and there are no uneaten eggs. In fact, they need an additional 8 eggs to meet their weekly consumption."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"In theory, Christopher Nolan could borrow pants from Danny DeVito, but there are several factors to consider before making a decision: 1. Size Differences: Christopher Nolan and Danny DeVito likely have different body sizes and types. Christopher Nolan is 5'11\\" (180 cm), while Danny DeVito is 4'10\\" (147 cm). This height difference may lead to differences in pant sizes, making it less likely for Christopher Nolan to find a suitable pair of pants from Danny DeVito. 2. Style Preferences: Both individuals might have different style preferences when it comes to clothing. Christopher Nolan is known to dress more formally, while Danny DeVito's style can be more casual. This factor might affect the suitability of pants borrowed. 3. Personal Relationship: We would need to consider whether Christopher Nolan and Danny DeVito even know each other well enough for one to borrow clothing from the other. They are both prominent figures in the entertainment industry, but that does not guarantee a close personal relationship. 4. Willingness to Share: Lastly, we have to take into account whether or not Danny DeVito would be willing to lend his pants to Christopher Nolan. People can be protective of their personal belongings, and there might be hygienic concerns that prevent them from sharing such items. Given these factors, it is possible that Christopher Nolan could borrow pants from Danny DeVito, but it is not guaranteed or likely due to differences in size, style preferences, personal relationship, and willingness to share."},{"question":"Problem: Solve 1366*v - 18073 = 783*v for v.

Reasoning: The answer \\"it is not possible to tell\\" is justified due to the limitations in our current understanding, capabilities in exploring various ecosystems, and the constant evolution of life on Earth. Estimations of the total number of species on Earth vary greatly, with some experts suggesting that there could be tens of millions or even more. Several factors contribute to the difficulty in coming up with an exact number: 1. Undiscovered species: Researchers and scientists continuously discover new species in remote locations and unexplored parts of the planet. Some species may inhabit inaccessible areas, such as deep-sea trenches or the depths of dense jungles. 2. Extinction and evolution: As species go extinct or evolve, the total number of species on the planet can change. Extinction might be a result of various factors like habitat loss, climate change, or poaching. Simultaneously, species could evolve and adapt to new environments, creating new distinct species. 3. Microorganisms: A vast number of microorganisms are challenging to identify and classify. This includes bacteria, archaea, protists, and microscopic fungi. Some of these microorganisms might be living in extreme environments or conditions that currently elude detection. 4. Incomplete information: The classification and documentation of species is an ongoing process. The discovery, identification, and taxonomic classification of new species can take years and might revise or supplement prior understandings, making it difficult to settle on a single, accurate number. Due to these challenges and the dynamic nature of ecosystems, it is not possible to tell precisely how many species exist on Earth."},{"question":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Using warm water and soap, apply a washcloth to gently wash out your new piercing. Keeping dirt, grime, and bacteria away from the wound should be enough to prevent infection. Be sure to clean the piercing after exercise, going outside, cooking, or cleaning. Rubbing alcohol, though it kills bacteria, will dry out your skin and potentially cause an infection. While you could buy saline at the piercing parlor, you can also make it at home with only 2 ingredients. Mix 1/8 tablespoon of non-iodized sea salt into a cup of distilled water and stir until it dissolves. Submerge your piercing in the saltwater, or soak a clean cotton swab in the water and apply it to the piercing for 20 minutes twice a day. Dirty hands are the number one cause of infection, so always wash your hands before touching or treating your piercing. If you have a piercing that is constantly rubbing on your clothes, wear looser clothing. This is especially true for navel, genital, nipple, or other body piercings. These places are hot-spots of moisture and bacteria that commonly lead to infections. Your piercing is an open wound and it will absorb bacteria much more readily then unbroken skin. Don’t freak out if you see redness or soreness in the first few days after a piercing. This is your body’s normal response to a puncture. Inflammation is common and can be easily treated with an ice-pack and ibuprofen. If the inflammation lasts for more than 3-5 days, however, you may be developing an infection. While it may seem counterintuitive, you should avoid removing the jewelry if you notice signs of active infection, such as pus, since removing the jewelry can cause the piercing to close up and trap the infection inside your body. It's important that the piercing remain open so that it can drain; otherwise, you may develop an abscess or worsen the existing infection.

They help us adapt our behaviors to the world surrounding us.; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Imagine a world in which there were suddenly no emotion -- a world in which human beings could feel no love or happiness, no terror or hate.Try to imagine the consequences of such a transformation.People might not be able to stay alive: knowing neither joy nor pleasure, anxiety nor fear, they would be as likely to repeat acts that hurt them as acts that were beneficial.They could not learn: they could not benefit from experience because this emotionless world would lack rewards and punishments.Society would soon disappear: people would be as likely to harm one another as to provide help and support.Human relationships would not exist: in a world without friends or enemies, there could be no marriage, affection among companions, or bonds among members of groups.Society's economic underpinnings would be destroyed: since earning 10 million would be no more pleasant than earning 10, there would be no incentive to work.In fact, there would be no incentives of any kind, for as we will see, incentives mean a capacity to enjoy them. In such a world, the chances that the human species would survive are next to zero, because emotions are the basic instruments of our survival and adaptation.Emotions structure the world for us in important ways.As individuals, we categorize objects on the basis of our emotions.True, we consider the length, shape, size or texture, but an object's physical aspects are less important than what it has done or can do to us -- hurt us, surprise us, anger us or make us joyful.We also use categorizations colored by emotions in our families, communities, and overall society.Out of our emotional experience with objects and events comes a social feeling of agreement that certain things and actions are \\"good\\" and others are \\"bad\\", and we apply these categories to every aspect of our social life -- from what foods we eat and what clothes we wear to how we keep promises and which people our group will accept.In fact, society uses our emotional reactions and attitudes, such as loyalty, morality,... Question: Why are the emotional aspects of an object more important than its physical aspects? Answer: A:","response":"4. They help us adapt our behaviors to the world surrounding us. The emotional aspects of an object are more important than its physical aspects because emotions play a crucial role in our survival, adaptation, and the way we perceive and interact with the world around us. Emotions help us to categorize objects and events based on the way they make us feel, which allows us to make decisions that affect our well-being and social interactions. An object's physical aspects, such as its size, shape, or texture, may be less important because they do not directly influence how it affects our emotional state and consequent actions. By reacting to the emotional aspects of an object, we develop social agreements on which things and actions are considered good or bad. This emotional categorization also extends to various aspects of our social life, such as our choices in food, clothing, and moral values. By prioritizing emotional aspects over physical aspects, individuals and societies can better adapt to their environment and make decisions that promote survival, cooperation, and connection within social groups."},{"question":"\\"The problem could occur if [another] pipeline is constructed in the future.

Cotton, as one of the most widely used natural fibers, plays a significant role in the global textile industry. However, the cultivation of cotton is often associated with negative environmental impacts that can have long-lasting and damaging consequences on ecosystems and human health. This question seeks to explore the implications of cotton farming on the environment and discuss sustainable practices that can help reduce these negative effects. 1. Pesticide and chemical usage: The cultivation of cotton heavily relies on the use of chemical pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers to protect the crop from pests and enhance growth. These chemicals can cause soil contamination, water pollution, and pose harm to both human health and wildlife. Sustainable practices that aim to reduce the use of these harmful substances include Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which involves the selective use of pesticides, natural predators, and alternative methods to control pests, and the use of organic fertilizers, such as compost and manure. 2. Water consumption: Cotton farming is also known for its high water usage, which leads to the depletion of freshwater resources, particularly in regions suffering from water scarcity. To address this, sustainable irrigation practices, such as drip irrigation or sprinkler systems, can be implemented to optimize water usage and minimize water waste. Additionally, breeding cotton plants that require less water or are more drought-resistant can help conserve water resources. 3. Soil degradation: Continuous cotton cultivation can lead to soil degradation due to the loss of nutrients and organic matter. Crop rotation and the implementation of cover crops can help prevent soil erosion, restore fertility, and maintain a healthy ecosystem. Moreover, using conservation tillage methods, which involve minimum soil disturbance, can help preserve the soil structure and reduce soil erosion. 4. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs): Genetically modified cotton varieties are prevalent in the market, which has resulted in the loss of genetic diversity in cotton cultivars. Although GMOs may bring some benefits, such as pest resistance, they can also contribute to the development of pesticide-resistant pests and the spread of transgenes to wild cotton relatives. Promoting the cultivation of traditional and locally adapted cotton varieties can help maintain genetic diversity and adaptability. 5. Fair labor practices: Lastly, the cotton industry is often linked to unfair labor practices, such as child labor, forced labor, and low wages for farmers. To encourage sustainable cotton production, fair trade certifications and other initiatives can be implemented to ensure that farmers receive fair prices for their harvest, access to education, and improved working conditions. To summarize, the environmental implications of cotton farming can be mitigated through the adoption of sustainable practices, including Integrated Pest Management, water-saving irrigation techniques, soil conservation methods, promotion of genetic diversity, and the support of fair labor practices. By implementing these measures, the cotton industry can minimize its negative impacts on the environment and pave the way for a more sustainable future."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Jewish people often faced?\\" Context: \\"During the Middle Ages, Paris was a center of Jewish learning with famous Talmudic scholars, such as Yechiel of Paris who took part in the Disputation of Paris between Christian and Jewish intellectuals. The Parisian Jewish community was victim of persecution, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the Holocaust during World War II, half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa Sephardic Jews settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today. There are currently 83 synagogues in the city; The Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, built in 1913 by architect Hector Guimard, is a Paris landmark.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"During the Middle Ages, Jewish people in Paris often faced a multitude of challenges and hardships, including persecution, expulsions, and difficult returns to the city. The fluctuating political and social atmosphere significantly impacted the Parisian Jewish community, leading to ongoing adversity. Persecution: The Parisian Jewish community was subjected to discrimination and prejudice during the Middle Ages. This persecution took various forms such as social exclusion, hostility, and animosity from the Christian majority. Anti-Semitic attitudes, prevalent at the time, were fueled by the belief that Jews were Christ-killers and the scapegoating of Jews for widespread economic and social problems. Expulsions and Returns: Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews in Paris faced numerous instances of expulsions only to be readmitted and expelled again. Notable examples include the 1249 expulsion by King Louis IX, the 1306 expulsion under Philip IV, and the 1394 expulsion ordered by Charles VI. In between these expulsions, French monarchs temporarily allowed the return of Jews for various reasons, including their valuable skills in trade, finance, and medicine. Impact of the French Revolution: The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, proclaimed during the French Revolution, granted full civil rights to the Jewish population in France, making it the first European country to do so. Despite the newfound legal equality, underlying anti-Semitic attitudes persisted, and many Jews continued to face discrimination within society. World War II and the Holocaust: The persecution of Jewish people took a devastating turn during World War II under Nazi occupation. Half of Paris's Jewish population perished in concentration camps, while others managed to escape to safer territories. After the war, France's Jewish community sought to rebuild and remember those who had been lost during the Holocaust. North African Sephardic Immigration: In the 1960s, Paris saw a new wave of Jewish migration as a result of political instability in North Africa. Many Sephardic Jews from countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia settled in Paris, adding a rich diversity to the city's Jewish community, which now constitutes the majority of the Parisian Jewish population. Present-day Jewish community: Today, the Jewish community in Paris is diverse and thriving, with 83 synagogues and cultural institutions scattered throughout the city. Landmarks such as the Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, designed by Hector Guimard, stand as symbols of the resilience and perseverance of the Parisian Jewish community despite the difficult history they have faced over the centuries. In conclusion, Jewish people in Paris have faced significant challenges throughout history, including persecution, expulsions, and the devastating impact of the Holocaust. However, the community has also shown resilience, rebuilding and adapting after each hardship. Today, the Parisian Jewish community is diverse and vibrant, contributing extensively to the city's rich cultural tapestry."},{"question":"What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the father of the child to the woman who journeys west? from the following article ?

We have: -10*t = -23*t + 30*t - 119 First, let's look at the \\"t\\" parts. We have -23*t and 30*t together. If you have -23 cookies and I give you 30 cookies, how many cookies do you have now? That's right, you have 7 cookies! So, let's replace the -23*t + 30*t with 7*t: -10*t = 7*t - 119 Now, let's take the 7*t and move it from the right side to the left side. To do that, we must change its sign. So if we have 7*t, we'll change it to -7*t: -10*t - 7*t = -119 Now, let's combine the two \\"t\\" parts on the left side. If you have -10 apples and I take away 7 more apples, how many apples do you have? That's correct, you have -17 apples! So, let's write that down: -17*t = -119 We're almost done!

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The girl ate a diamond.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The girl ate a brigadier.\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","response":"Both sentences can be considered nonsensical depending on the context. Let's take a closer look at each sentence and its meaning. - Sentence A: \\"The girl ate a diamond.\\" This sentence is grammatically correct, but the content is nonsensical from a literal standpoint. Diamonds are hard, valuable gemstones that cannot be consumed like food. It's highly unlikely that a girl would eat a diamond, and doing so would be harmful and potentially dangerous. However, if the sentence is intended as a metaphor or part of a fictional story, it could make sense in a non-literal context. - Sentence B: \\"The girl ate a brigadier.\\" Again, the sentence is grammatically correct, but the content is nonsensical from a literal standpoint. A brigadier is a military rank, referring to a person who holds that rank. It is impossible to eat a person, so this sentence also doesn't make sense in a literal context. Like Sentence A, if it is intended as a metaphor or part of a fictional story, it could have a non-literal meaning. Both sentences contain nonsensical elements due to their literal interpretation.

Unicorns are mythical creatures and not typically associated with a nation's symbol, especially for countries like Brazil that have a rich fauna. 2. The actual national symbol of Brazil is the \\"Ordem e Progresso\\" (Order and Progress) banner on the Brazilian flag, not a unicorn. 3. National symbols usually represent something significant about the particular nation's history, culture, or values, and the unicorn does not hold such relevance in Brazilian culture.

Article: Everyone wants some degree of success. Many people believe that they deserve success simply because they believe that they deserve success. But there is a widespread belief that people who get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it, but because of influential friends or the right background. Sometimes it may just be a comforting and harmless belief, while at the other extreme it can be very destructive. I once met a brilliant young engineer who worked in a chemical plant. Because of her knowledge and experience, she should have been promoted to Production Manager. Instead, the job went to a man who was totally unsuited for the post. Everyone knew that he only got it because he was politically acceptable to his superiors . This injustice discouraged the young engineer and many of her colleagues. It also meant that the factory was much less efficient than it could have been. At the same time, we should not be pessimistic . More and more the modern world depends on having people who are in the job because they are good enough, not just because their faces fit. There is a story of a factory owner who sent for an engineer to see to a machine which would not go. He examined it, then took out a hammer and tapped, once. The machine started up immediately. When he presented his bill, the owner protested, \\"This can't be right! 100 just for tapping a machine with a hammer?\\" The engineer wrote out a new bill: \\"For tapping a machine, 1; for knowing where to tap. 99.\\" Question: What can we learn about the author's attitude toward the widespread belief that \\"people get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it\\"? Answer: Answer:","response":"The author's attitude toward the widespread belief that \\"people get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it\\" seems to be critical. They recognize that this belief can sometimes be comforting and harmless, but in other instances, it can be destructive, leading to injustices and inefficiencies, as illustrated in the story of the young engineer. They also suggest that the modern world increasingly depends on people being in jobs due to their qualifications and skills, implying that the author would prefer a more merit-based system."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"Oklahoma City is protected by the Oklahoma City Fire Department (OKCFD), which employs 1015 paid, professional firefighters.

Guidelines: 1. Consider prototypical situations 2. Provide a correct answer 3. Provide complete justification for the answer Answer: Determining the greatest American athlete currently can be subjective and depends on various factors such as the athlete's achievements, personal preferences, and the comparison of different sports. Considering prototypical situations, we can look at the recent successes, influence, and impact of athletes in their respective sports. At present, one could argue that Simone Biles, a gymnast, is among the greatest American athletes. The following points provide a complete justification for this choice. 1. Achievements: Simone Biles has a staggering number of 25 World Championship medals, 19 of which are gold. In addition, she has four Olympic gold medals from the 2016 Rio Olympics. 2. Influence: Biles has broken several records in gymnastics and has skills named after her due to their complexity and her mastery in performing them. Her performances have shifted the sport's perception and pushed the boundaries of what is possible in gymnastics. 3. Impact: Simone's success and resilience, despite facing personal challenges, have made her a role model for many aspiring athletes and gymnasts. Ultimately, it's crucial to note that other incredible American athletes excel in their respective sports, such as Serena Williams (tennis), LeBron James (basketball), or Katie Ledecky (swimming).

Prior to assuming the presidency, Bush served as the 43rd Vice President of the United States from 1981 to 1989. A member of the Republican Party, he had previously been a Congressman, Ambassador and Director of Central Intelligence. While active in the public sector, he was known simply as George Bush; since 2001, he has often been referred to as George H. W. Bush, Bush the Elder or George Bush Senior in order to distinguish him from his eldest son, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States. The United States was drawn into World War II when the Empire of Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Six months later, Bush enlisted into the US. Navy immediately after he graduated from Phillips Academy on his eighteenth birthday. He became a naval aviator training for aircraft carrier landings and takeoffs on the USS Sable. After completing the 10-month course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9, 1943 (just three days before his 19th birthday), which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date. In September 1943, he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron (VT-51) as the photographic officer. The following year, his squadron was based on USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname \\"Skin\\". During this time, the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: the Battle of the Philippine Sea. After Bush's promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on August 1, 1944, San Jacinto commenced operations against the Japanese in the Bonin Islands. Bush piloted one of four Grumman TBM Avenger aircraft from VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on Chichijima. His crew for the mission, which occurred on September 2, 1944, included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lieutenant Junior Grade William White. During their attack, the Avengers encountered intense anti-aircraft fire; Bush's aircraft was hit by flak and his engine caught on fire. Despite the fire in his aircraft, Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target, scoring several damaging hits. With his engine ablaze, Bush flew several miles from the island, where he and one other crew member on the TBM Avenger bailed out of the aircraft; the other man's parachute did not open. Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft, while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the lifeguard submarine USS Finback. For the next month, he remained on Finback and participated in the rescue of other pilots. Several of those shot down during the attack were executed, and their livers were eaten by their captors. In November 1944, Bush returned to San Jacinto and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the United States. Through 1944, he flew 58 combat missions for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Air Medals, and the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to San Jacinto. Because of his valuable combat experience, Bush was reassigned to Norfolk Navy Base and put in a training wing for new torpedo pilots. He was later assigned as a naval aviator in a new torpedo squadron, VT-153, based at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan. The unconditional surrender of Japan was announced on August 15, 1945.

Assurer la protection et la restauration des populations de renards véloces est une préoccupation majeure pour la préservation de la biodiversité et la sauvegarde de cet animal emblématique. Le renard véloce, aussi connu comme le renard des plaines, est une espèce menacée et vulnérable aux différents dangers qui peuvent compromettre sa survie, tels que l'empoisonnement accidentel, les pièges et les collisions avec les véhicules. L'empoisonnement accidentel des renards véloces peut survenir lorsque ces animaux ingèrent des substances toxiques provenant de pesticides, de raticides ou d'autres produits chimiques utilisés pour le contrôle des nuisibles. Une gestion rigoureuse des produits chimiques et une surveillance accrue des zones où vivent les renards véloces sont nécessaires pour prévenir ces incidents. Le piégeage est un autre danger auquel le renard véloce est confronté. Souvent, les renards sont pris dans les pièges destinés à d'autres animaux, comme les coyotes ou les animaux à fourrure. Pour éviter les prises accidentelles, il est important de mettre en place des mesures de régulation de la chasse et du piégeage, ainsi que de sensibiliser les chasseurs et les trappeurs aux bonnes pratiques pour épargner les renards véloces. Les collisions avec les véhicules représentent un risque significatif pour le renard véloce, en particulier dans les zones où les routes traversent leur habitat naturel. Les mesures de prévention peuvent inclure l'aménagement d'éco-ponts et de passages à faune pour faciliter le déplacement des renards en toute sécurité, ainsi que la réduction des vitesses de circulation dans les zones à risque. Pour s'assurer que ces menaces ne compromettent pas la restauration des populations de renards véloces, la mise en œuvre d'un plan de conservation global est essentielle.

His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. Owen was introduced to football at the age of seven by his father who soon saw Michael as the most promising athlete in the family. A boyhood Everton fan, Owen attended Rector Drew Primary School in Hawarden, Flintshire, north Wales and by the age of ten, some of the nation's leading scouts were monitoring his progress. Context: Owen scored his first goal for United back from injury in a 7-1 pre-season victory against a League of Ireland XI on 4 August 2010 at the newly built Aviva Stadium. On 22 September 2010, Owen netted his first goals of the season as he netted twice during a 5-2 away win over Scunthorpe United in the third round of the League Cup. Four days later, Owen scored his first league goal of the season as he netted United's second equaliser with his first touch in a 2-2 away draw against Bolton Wanderers. Owen's first goal of 2011 came in United's 2-1 FA Cup victory over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium on 29 January. On 25 February, United manager Alex Ferguson said that Owen was a key part of his squad for the rest of the season. However, he suffered a groin injury and missed his team's next four games.

Answer:","response":"The first step in the process of how a greenhouse works and warms the air inside involves the transmission of sunlight through the greenhouse's transparent or translucent walls and roof. This allows the sunlight to enter the greenhouse and provide light energy for photosynthesis and warmth for the plants and floor. As sunlight is composed of a broad spectrum of wavelengths, it contains both visible light and infrared radiation, which is the primary source of heat. Upon entering the greenhouse, the sunlight interacts with the various surfaces inside, including the plants and the floor. The plants absorb a portion of the sunlight in the visible spectrum for the process of photosynthesis, allowing them to grow and thrive in a controlled environment. Simultaneously, the plants, floor, and other surfaces within the greenhouse absorb the infrared radiation that contributes to heating the interior. This absorption of sunlight and its conversion to heat energy is crucial for maintaining the warm and stable temperature within the greenhouse. This optimal environment is particularly beneficial for growing plants that require consistent temperatures and conditions, such as seedlings, flowers, and vegetables. As the absorbed heat raises the temperature of the air near the plants and floor, the warmer air begins to rise due to its lower density compared to cooler air. This movement of hot air creates a natural circulation within the greenhouse that helps distribute heat evenly among its contents. The glass or plastic walls and roof of the greenhouse prevent the escape of this warm air, effectively trapping it inside and maintaining consistently higher temperatures than the outside environment. The colder air at the top of the greenhouse then descends as it is displaced by the rising hot air, creating a continuous cycle of warm air being replaced by cooler air that will subsequently be heated by its contact with the warm floor and plants. This constant circulation of air ensures that the greenhouse remains at a uniformly stable temperature, fostering a conducive environment for plant growth and development. In summary, the first step in the process of a greenhouse warming the air inside is the transmission of sunlight through its transparent or translucent walls and roof, allowing it to interact with the surfaces and plants inside and providing the light and heat necessary for plant growth and maintaining optimal greenhouse conditions."},{"question":"Report: Hillary’s Small Dollar Donors Are Donating More Than They Expected By Jazz Shaw, Hot Air I have a confession to make.

Options are: (1). no; (2). yes;","response":"(2). yes; In linguistics, paraphrasing covers the process of restating some text in other words. The objective of paraphrasing is to imbue the same conceptual content but through different form or structure, which is why paraphrased sentences often retain the core meaning of the original content, but their structure, word use and sometimes even sentence length may differ. The reader ought to be able to understand the same underlying message regardless of which version they read. Now, when we look at the two sentences in question, we see they distinctly encapsulate the same idea or concept - the context being that synonymous ablation can cause cell ablation and that it might be used as a genetic term under the right circumstances. Hence, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Statement one, \\"As synonymous ablation may lead to cell ablation, it can be used as a genetic term at appropriate times,\\" tells us the same information as statement two, \\"As synonymous ablation can lead to cell ablation, it can be used at appropriate times as a genetic term.\\" The element of paraphrasing is demonstrated through the different placement of \\"at appropriate times\\" and slight rewording from \\"may lead to\\" in the first sentence to \\"can lead to\\" in the second.

Patrick, a 430lb Western lowland gorilla, will be moved from Dallas Zoo to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, where he will live the bachelor life in his own digs. His new home is known for working with gorillas with behaviour problems. Not a ladies' man: Patrick, a 430-pound Western lowland gorilla, will be moved to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, after he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others. Dallas Zoo officials said Patrick gets along fine with humans but not with other gorillas. They said they have tried repeatedly to socialise him with the other gorillas, particularly the females, in the hopes that he might get along and even breed. Instead, he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others. 'It's not like we haven't tried, he's been here for 18 years' said Laurie Holloway, a spokesman for the zoo. Patrick was more tolerant of other male gorillas but seemed only to engage with Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after he escaped in 2004 and injured three people. Only friend: Patrick (background) with his friend Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after escaping and injuring three people in 2004. Because of his cranky behaviour, Patrick has been kept in his own habitat separate from the other gorillas. But Dallas Zoo needs to reclaim Patrick's space because it recently acquired two new males from the Calgary Zoo, including Zola, a break-dancing gorilla who stars in a video that has gone viral on the Internet. John Davis, curator of mammals at the Riverbanks Zoo, said that initially Patrick will be separated from the zoo's three other gorillas, all males, but will be able to see and smell them. Eventually Patrick will be introduced to the guys and zoo officials aren't ruling out the possibility that they can live together in a spacious, wooded bachelor pad, Davis said. Born at the Bronx Zoo in 1990, Patrick was abandoned by his mother and then transferred to the Toronto Zoo, where he was hand-raised along with another male about the same age. At age five, he was transferred to Dallas, zoo officials said. Because of his rearing, Patrick gets along well with people and is a popular favorite among visitors and zookeepers at the Dallas Zoo, Holloway said. 'He's beautiful and smart and everyone loves him,' said Ms Holloway. 'We're really sad to see him go but it's for the best for the zoo and for Patrick.' The zoo will have a few days of 'We'll miss ya, Patrick!' celebrations for the ousted primate. Highlights:","response":"1.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Today, we're going to talk about something very important. Have you ever heard of climate? Climate is what we call the big picture of weather, like if it's usually hot or cold, rainy or sunny in the place where you live. Soon, there will be a big report about climate. A report is when people write about what they have learned. Many grown-ups are worried because the report will say our planet is getting too warm. This is because humans are doing some things that hurt the Earth, like burning lots of fuel and cutting down trees. Now, let's think in a different way about this big climate report. Instead of being sad and worried, let's see what we can do to help our planet! 1) Learn All About the Weather: Sometimes, we can learn about important things by reading or listening. The big climate report will be good to learn from because it helps us understand the trouble the Earth is in. It will tell us why the world is getting too warm and how that might make the weather very strange. 2) Talk to Your Friends and Family: It's good to share what you know with your friends and family because more people working together is powerful. Tell them about the big climate report and why our Earth is getting too warm. Explain that if we don't do something quick, we might not have enough water, food, or cool air in some places. 3) Find Ways to Help: The best thing you can do is find ways to help our Earth. There are so many things you can do! You can ask your parents to use less water at home, or maybe walk or ride a bicycle instead of driving a car.

If a new BabyCenter poll is any guide, _ .A surprisingly large number of parents still insist that their children practice such old-fashioned manners as putting pen-to-paper to say thank you,treating adults with respect and addressing adults as \\"Mr., Mrs.or Miss.\\"A majority of the 1,000 parents surveyed also said they insist at dinner that children keep napkins in their laps,ask to be excused from the table and refrain from talking with a full mouth. Among the reasons cited most often by parents,BabyCenter says,is that \\"the world is a more free-wheeling place,and they want to give their kids a stronger moral compass to guide them.\\"This thinking was affirmed by 64%of those surveyed.And 58%say they see so many badly behaved kids around them that they're determined to raise their children differently.

In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - Michael Emile \\"Mikey\\" Craig (born 15 February 1960) is an English musician and DJ, best known as a bassist of the 1980s pop group Culture Club. - George Alan O'Dowd (born 14 June 1961), known professionally as Boy George, is an English singer, songwriter, DJ, fashion designer and photographer. He is the lead singer of the Grammy and Brit Award-winning pop band Culture Club. At the height of the band's fame, during the 1980s, they recorded global hit songs such as \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\" and \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and George is known for his soulful voice and androgynous appearance. He was part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. - Jonathan \`\` Jon '' Aubrey Moss is an English drummer , best known as a member of the 1980s pop group Culture Club . He has also played with other bands , including London , The Nips , The Damned and Adam & The Ants . - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material. - Culture Club are an English band that was formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million records worldwide, including 13 million records in the United States. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Marching percussion instruments are specially designed to be played while moving. This is achieved by attaching the drum(s) to a special harness (also called a carrier or rack) worn by the drummer, although not all marching bands use such harnesses and instead use traditional baldrics to sling their drums (the British Armed Forces, for instance, still use the old style of slung drums). The drums are designed and tuned for maximum articulation and projection of sound, as marching activities are almost always outdoors or in large interior spaces. Articulation is paramount to producing a \\"clean\\" sound from all the drummers in the line. These instruments are used by marching bands, drum and bugle corps, indoor percussion ensembles, and pipe bands. A marching percussion ensemble is frequently known as a drumline or battery.

Which country didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats? Spain and Italy participated in a global warming global forum this year. it turns out that Spain uses lots of fossil fuel and natural gas for their economy, while Italy relies on ecological alternatives. Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, is a white rapper and is not black. However, it is true that he experienced bullying during his childhood, though it was not because of his race. Eminem was raised in a predominantly African American, working-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. As one of the few white kids in his community, he was often targeted by bullies who picked on him because of his race and social status. Eminem dealt with a lot of harassment and physical abuse during his time in school, and his turbulent childhood experiences influenced his music and lyrics throughout his career.

Sign language is not just a random collection of gestures but a full-blown language in its own right, complete with its own grammatical rules. Each country or region has its own sign language, as different from each other as English is from Spanish. Each version of sign language is somewhat linked to the spoken language in its region. For example, American sign language does share similarities with English, even though it is its own language. The advantages of knowing sign language in addition to a spoken language are many. Communication becomes possible on many levels with the deaf community, with other people either hearing or not in any of the above situations, as well as many more. While other languages take years to learn, American Sign Language can be taught in a much shorter time period. It is one of the easiest languages to learn because most of the signs were developed to mimic the actual word or phrase it is representing. Even the alphabet signs look like the letters of the English alphabet. American Sign Language, or ASL, is the third most used language in the United States. Used by the deaf community, interpreters, and friends and family of the deaf. There are a lot of sites on the internet that not only shows you the sign with video, but will help you practice reading signs as well.

Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","response":"It seems like you're comparing two very distinct entities: one being the historical and mythological figure, Apollo, and the other the literary character, D'Artagnan. To provide a detailed answer and reasoning, let's look at them individually and then compare. 1. Apollo: In Greek and Roman mythology, Apollo is a god associated with many aspects, such as music, poetry, art, healing, and prophecy. He is the son of Zeus and Leto and the twin brother of Artemis. As one of the Olympian gods, Apollo possesses divine powers, such as the ability to manipulate light, truth, knowledge, healing, and diseases. He is also an archer with unmatched skills in archery. 2. D'Artagnan: The character, Charles Ogier de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan, is a fictional protagonist created by Alexandre Dumas in \\"The Three Musketeers\\" novel. D'Artagnan is a young, brave, and skilled swordsman who seeks to join the King's Musketeers in France. He becomes friends with three Musketeers: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Throughout the novel, D'Artagnan and his friends engage in various adventures, displaying their courage, loyalty, and expert sword-fighting skills. Given these descriptions, comparing Apollo and D'Artagnan is like comparing apples to oranges, as one is a divine god, and the other is a brave human warrior. In a hypothetical structured scenario where we assume a finite number of historical or mythological \\"Apollonian\\" figures that represent different aspects of the god versus a similar number of \\"D'Artagnan\\" incarnations of different skill levels, the result would still very likely favor Apollo. The reasoning for this outcome is based on the inherent differences between the nature of the entities. On one hand, Apollo possesses divine powers, which would likely render him invulnerable to any human attack. Furthermore, the god's knowledge, archery skills, and control over light, truth, and diseases grant him significant advantages that D'Artagnan and his fellow swordsmen would not be able to match. On the other hand, while D'Artagnan and his peers are highly skilled sword fighters and strategists, they remain human warriors ultimately limited by their physical, mental, and emotional capacities. Therefore, in a hypothetical confrontation, the divine powers of Apollo would most likely overpower the fighting abilities of D'Artagnan and his fellow musketeers."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Presents For Children's Day Charles M.

Possible answers: A). Yes. B). No. Answer:","response":"B). No. While it is accurate to say that sugar provides energy, it would be misleading to suggest that \\"energy\\" is the right answer in this context, given that the question explicitly connects sugar with diabetes. Sugar does indeed act as a primary energy source for the body, but the relationship between sugar and diseases like diabetes requires a more nuanced discussion. The role sugar plays in diabetes is complex and multidimensional. Diabetes is a metabolic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels or hyperglycemia. It results from the body's inability to produce sufficient insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or utilize insulin efficiently (Type 2 diabetes). Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas, which regulates blood sugar levels by promoting the absorption of glucose from the bloodstream. As a source of calories, sugar can contribute to energy intake and potentially lead to weight gain if not properly balanced with energy expenditure from physical activity. Obesity is a well-established risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight through balanced diet and regular exercise can help lower the risk of diabetes and several other health problems. Moreover, it is crucial to understand that our sources of sugar intake are not all equal. For instance, naturally occurring sugars, found in fruits and dairy products, are typically considered less harmful than added sugars and refined carbohydrates. Natural sugars tend to come with other nutrients, like fiber, vitamins, and minerals, that are beneficial for overall health. Conversely, added sugars, which are found in processed foods like soft drinks, candy, cookies, and other items with high levels of refined carbohydrates, can lead to a rapid increase in blood sugar levels. Consuming large amounts of added sugars can result in insulin resistance, a precursor to Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is essential to moderate and monitor sugar intake, particularly from added and refined sources. In conclusion, although sugar does provide energy, it would be inappropriate to solely associate it with energy when addressing a question about its link to diabetes. A detailed answer should include a discussion of the different types of sugar, the role of sugar in diabetes and insulin resistance, and the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle in reducing diabetes risk."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Write a story that ends with: The ambulance treated her snake bike.","response":"Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by lush forests and towering mountains, there lived a young girl named Lila. The villagers would often come to her for her extensive knowledge of plants, as she had a gift for understanding their various uses, healing properties, and even their dangers. One sunny summer day, Lila decided to venture deeper into the forest in search of new plants to study. She had heard of a rare flower that blossomed only under specific circumstances which she had not yet encountered in her previous expeditions. Excited and focused, Lila began her journey into the heart of the forest. Step by step, Lila navigated the dense forest, taking in the sights, smells, and sounds surrounding her. The dense greenery and towering trees, the faint scents of distant flowers, and the chorus of birds and insects filled her with awe and wonder. Just as Lila began to grow tired, she discovered the elusive flower, a unique plant that she had never seen before. With a careful hand, she plucked the flower and began examining it, completely lost in her study. Suddenly, Lila felt a sharp pain in her ankle. Startled, she looked down to find that a venomous snake had bitten her. Panic set in as she felt the snake venom coursing through her body, leaving her weak and light-headed. Desperate for help, Lila struggled to find her way back to the edge of the forest, knowing that her village was too far to reach on foot. Lila's luck turned when a group of people from the nearby city found her, struggling to walk and looking pale. They quickly contacted emergency services and, within minutes, the familiar sound of an ambulance approached. As Lila was loaded into the ambulance, her world began to fade in and out of consciousness. The paramedics attending to her worked tirelessly and efficiently, administering antivenom and providing her with essential fluids. It was a race against time as they treated her for the deadly snake bite. Despite the odds, the medical team persevered. Lila couldn't believe it when she awoke in the ambulance, her strength returning and the pain from the snake bite subsiding. The antivenom had worked its wonders, and the skilled paramedics had saved her life. And so, the story ends on a happy note with Lila being rushed to the hospital for further treatment. That day, the seemingly unexpected turn of events ultimately turned in favor of a life saved, all because the ambulance treated her snake bite."},{"question":"When its deleted by Bitdefender Internet Security 2012 the infected DLL file would be removed too Please fix the punctuation.","response":"When it's deleted by Bitdefender Internet Security 2012, the infected DLL file would be removed too."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.

Hypothesis: Postal Service delivery is able to deliver more items because they offer faster shipment than their competitors. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise states that the Postal Service delivers at least 11 billion competing items. However, the success of Postal Service delivery in terms of the sheer number of items might not only be attributed to faster shipment than competitors, as suggested in the hypothesis. There could be a multitude of factors that contribute to the success of the Postal Service in delivering a higher volume of items. Let's explore some of these potential reasons. 1. Market penetration: The Postal Service might have a more extensive reach and penetration into various markets, covering both urban and rural areas. This widespread reach might enable the service to deliver more items, without necessarily offering faster shipment than its competitors. 2. Affordability: The Postal Service might offer more affordable rates compared to its competitors. This could attract a larger customer base, which could result in higher delivery volumes. The pricing strategy might be more influential in the volume of items delivered than the speed of delivery. 3. Reliability: The Postal Service might have a reputation for being a consistent and reliable delivery service that customers trust. The reliability factor could contribute to their success in delivering more items than their competitors, regardless of whether or not they offer faster shipment services. 4. Government support: As a government-backed entity, the Postal Service might enjoy certain benefits and support that its competitors do not have. This could include financial support, preferential access to public infrastructure, or other forms of assistance that help the Postal Service deliver a higher volume of items. 5. Diversified services: The Postal Service might offer a variety of delivery options tailored to different customer needs, such as certified mail, priority mail, media mail, and various express options. This diversified portfolio of services might attract a larger customer base and lead to a higher volume of items being delivered, regardless of whether or not their shipment times are faster than those of competitors. 6. Customer loyalty: Long-standing customers or businesses might be more likely to continue utilizing Postal Service due to familiarity, previous positive experiences, or contractual obligations. This loyalty could contribute to the high volume of items delivered, without necessarily implying faster shipment times. While the hypothesis suggests that the Postal Service might be able to deliver a higher volume of items due to faster shipment times, the premise does not necessarily entail this conclusion. The success of the Postal Service in delivering a large number of items could be influenced by various factors including market penetration, affordability, reliability, government support, diversified services, and customer loyalty. Therefore, it is important to consider these additional factors when analyzing the success of the Postal Service in delivering a high volume of items."},{"question":"How is \\"(Various sources -- 10/06/11 - 13/06/11)\\" said in Turkish?","response":"In Turkish, \\"(Various sources -- 10/06/11 - 13/06/11)\\" can be written and pronounced as \\"(Çeşitli kaynaklar -- 10/06/11 - 13/06/11)\\".

In fact, the Statue of Unity is located on Sadhu Bet Island along the Narmada River in the Kevadia colony in the State of Gujarat, India. The Statue of Unity, inaugurated on October 31, 2018, stands tall at a height of 182 meters (597 feet) and is the world's tallest statue, surpassing the Spring Temple Buddha in China. It is a monument dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who played a pivotal role in the unification of India and was also the country's first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister. Sadhu Bet Island was chosen for this spectacular monument due to several reasons: 1. Scenic location: The island is located between the Satpura and Vindhya mountain ranges, providing a picturesque backdrop for the statue. 2. Accessibility: The island can be easily reached by road and is near the Sardar Sarovar Dam, a major tourist attraction in itself. This dam is one of the largest in India and serves a crucial purpose in power generation, irrigation, and water supply. 3. Promoting tourism: The statue and the accompanying thematic park, museum, and other attractions help boost tourism in the region, contributing to local and international visits. 4. Connecting people to Sardar Patel's vision: The statue and its location on an island on the Narmada River symbolize the unity and integrity that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel strived for. The monument offers a panoramic view of the surrounding area, including the Sardar Sarovar Dam, and has become a significant tourist attraction in India, drawing millions of visitors each year. The Statue of Unity site is well equipped with various facilities such as a visitor center, museum and audiovisual gallery, and laser light and sound show, among others, to enhance the experience for tourists and educate them about the life and contributions of Sardar Patel in shaping modern India."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: jet, runway, taxi","response":"As the powerful jet, with its engines roaring and propelling it forward, began to taxi along the lengthy runway under the watchful eyes of the ground crew, the anticipation of liftoff and the adventure ahead filled both passengers and crew with excitement."},{"question":"News article: CHALLENGES FACING FOTOMAT WILTON, Conn.— The Fotomat Corporation, whose blue and yellow kiosks are a familiar fixture in thousands of shopping centers nationwide, hardly needs more competition. In the fiscal year ending last Jan. 31, the company earned only 734,000 on revenues of 236.7 million, following a loss the year before of 4.7 million. It has not paid a dividend since mid-1979. So how is the company responding to the announcement last month by Technicolor Inc. that it plans to build a 1,000-unit chain of onehour photo finishing stores over the next five years? ''I'm absolutely convinced the one-hour mini-labs can't produce the quality that we can, and they can't produce at our price,'' said Richard D. Irwin, chairman and chief executive of Fotomat, which offers overnight but not same-day service. This view finds support from James Chung, photographic analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''It's not going to be a problem for Fotomat, in that I don't think this one-hour processing will take off,'' he said. But Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst at Morgan Stanley and Company, said the growth of one-hour processing ''provides some worries about the future of the core business of Fotomat.'' Saddled with a chain in the United States and Canada of 3,800 stores, many of them with poor locations and/or obsolete formats, Fotomat has been struggling since late 1978 to turn itself around. That effort has included an attempt to capture more of the rapidly expanding 35-millimeter photographic market, the entering of the market for video cassette tapes, the introduction of a new store design and, currently, the selling of assets and curtailment of capital spending. Established in 1967 Established in 1967, Fotomat grew to include 2,269 stores eight years later, and net income reached 10.9 million. Over the next three years, however, while the chain added almost 500 stores each year, per-store sales fell 12 percent, and net income declined by more than 40 percent. ''The biggest single factor was our own ineptitude,'' Mr. Irwin said. In the rush to create more outlets, management ignored Fotomat's role as a merchandiser. New kiosks were put up near existing ones, cannibalizing sales, he said. Mr. Chung noted that Fotomat's torrid expansion coincided with the increased availability of photo finishing services in pharmacies and supermarkets, often in the same mall where the kiosks were located. He also noted that the kiosks, staffed with a single person, were unresponsive to the seasonal peaks and valleys. Finally, Fotomat management missed the shift from Instamatic cameras and films, which made up ''around 90 percent of the business'' in the early 1970's, to 35-millimeter film, which represents 50 percent of total exposures today, Mr. Irwin said. In December 1978, Fotomat introduced Series 35, a merchandising effort to capture the 35-millimeter market by stressing higher quality processing and larger prints. ''It's been a fabulous program,'' Mr. Irwin said. ''It is the right approach,'' Mr. Chung said, because 35-millimeter customers buy more prints and enlargements, and are also in the market for accessories. New and Larger Stores To accomodate that demand, Fotomat has been replacing kiosks with a new, larger design for its retail outlets. There are now 500 such units, which commonly sell accessories. They also provide room for Fotomat's growing videotape business. In 1978, Fotomat began selling a service that transfers 8-millimeter home movies to videotape cassettes, and began carrying blank tapes. The transfer business, while profitable, has grown slowly, but sales of blank tapes, also profitable, is growing ''extremely rapidly,'' Mr. Irwin said. But a 1979 entry into rentals of prerecorded tapes ''is costing us a bunch of money,'' he said. While these businesses ''could easily'' comprise more than a third of Fotomat's total sales in five years, photo finishing now still makes up more than 90 percent of the business. Extremely weak photofinishing sales in the quarter ended April 30 left Fotomat with a loss for the three months of 2.3 million, only slightly better than in the 1980 period. And the 1981 results were lifted by an after-tax gain of 1.5 million on the sale of a California office building and a Canadian film lab. Furthermore, high interest rates forced Fotomat to postpone a 63 million photographic paper plant it had planned to build in the United States with the Konishiroku Photo Industry Company, the Japanese giant that owns 8 percent of Fotomat's stock.

In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: In order to determine if it's possible to predict the position and velocity of an electron in an atom, we should first consider the principles of quantum mechanics. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum (and thus velocity) can be known, and vice versa. Now let's try to use that principle to understand the behavior of an electron in an atom. An electron in an atom moves within the limits of an electron cloud, which defines the region where the probability of finding the electron is high. This cloud represents the electron's position probability distribution, showcasing that, in reality, we can never pinpoint the exact position of the electron but only make educated guesses based on this probability. Furthermore, since we cannot precisely determine the position of an electron, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle asserts that the electron's velocity cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy either. To predict velocity, we would need to know the change in position over time; however, with the electron's position being uncertain, a precise velocity prediction is impossible. In conclusion, due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, it is not possible to tell with 100% accuracy the position and velocity of an electron in an atom."},{"question":"This article: Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds.

They're my legacy, so I hope they thrive -- and I sure hope they remember me fondly. Henry and Hannah are, of course, my children, now ages 15 and 19, respectively. Like any parent, I spend a lot of time thinking about my kids, including how I can best help them financially. This isn't simply about coughing up dollars and cents, though the sums involved have been frighteningly large. Rather, what it's really about is passing along values. Yes, I want my kids to be financially successful. But mostly, I want them to be competent, contented managers of their own money, so they don't spend their lives agonizing over their finances and dogged by foolish mistakes. I am not claiming to have the road map for every parent. We all have different values, different incomes and strong ideas about how best to raise children -- and you will likely scoff at some of the things I've done. With that caveat, here are a dozen ways I have endeavored to help my kids financially. If children are to grow up to be successful savers and investors, they need to learn two key skills: How to delay gratification and how to take risks prudently. The first is easily the most important. Indeed, the self-control needed to delay gratification is associated not only with good saving habits, but also with things like succeeding in school and coping better with frustration and stress. Yet this isn't an easy skill to teach. Henry and Hannah grew up spending their parents' cash, so they didn't have much incentive to curb their desires. My response? Make them feel like they're spending their own money. One of my early tricks was the soda game, which I learned about from a reader. When my children were young and we went to restaurants, I would give them a choice: They could have a soda or they could have 1. Henry and Hannah ended up drinking a lot of water. Emboldened by the soda game's success, I looked for other ways to apply the same notion. The breakthrough came when Hannah was 14 and Henry was 10. That was when I opened a savings account for each of them. The accounts came with a cash-machine card. Every three months since then, I have deposited pocket money for them in their savings accounts and, as they have grown older, their clothing allowance as well. That way, they've had to learn to budget for a three-month period. More important, they no longer ask me for money. Instead, if they want to buy something, they have to ask themselves. The effect has been startling. Henry and Hannah almost immediately became more careful spenders. Sound manipulative? You'd better believe it. But I also think of it as financial self-defense. Suppose Henry and Hannah don't learn good money skills and grow up to be financial deadbeats. If they ended up deeply in debt, I can't imagine not helping -- at which point their financial problems would be mine. I haven't just molded Henry and Hannah with financial incentives. I have also used family stories. Values are passed down to our children in the stories we tell. My children may live in an affluent household in an affluent town. But I want them to know that their mother and I struggled financially, and that they will likely have their own struggles. So I talk about the mouse- and cockroach-infested Brooklyn apartment where we all lived while their mother worked on her Ph.D. and we squeaked by on a junior reporter's salary. I tell them about the beaten-up '76 Camaro that used to stall if the traffic light stayed red too long. I recount taking them as toddlers to the \\"toy museum,\\" otherwise known as FAO Schwarz, where we would play with the dolls and the trains but never buy. Instead of regaling my children with these tales, I could simply lecture them about the virtues of thrift. But the stories pack far more punch. I have also encouraged my kids to be suspicious of displays of opulence, whether it's the big house, the fancy car or the designer clothes. The fact is, this sort of spending doesn't lead to lasting happiness, but it can create a heap of financial stress. In belittling conspicuous consumption, I may be a little too strident, but there's a reason. Henry and Hannah may have grown up hearing about the dilapidated Brooklyn apartment. But I grew up hearing a far more powerful story, about my maternal grandfather and his four siblings, who in the 1940s each inherited what today would be millions of dollars. My grandfather's siblings quickly blew the money on fast cars and high living. My grandfather blew his money more slowly, on horses and cattle farming. Either way, the great family fortune was gone, and reckless spending was largely to blame. When my children were young, I opened a variable annuity for each of them. This isn't a product I particularly like, because many have outrageously high annual expenses and charge back-end sales commissions if you sell within, say, the first seven years. Still, there are a few no-load variable annuities with low annual expenses, notably the offerings from Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group. Moreover, unlike with an individual retirement account, you don't need earned income to fund a variable annuity, so you can open an account for a toddler. Today, my kids' low-cost variable annuities are each worth some 37,000. I have long been captivated by the idea of starting Henry and Hannah on the road to retirement. Think about it: The dollars I invested when they were youngsters might enjoy six decades of tax-deferred compounding. That's enough to turn 1 into over 100, assuming an 8% annual return. And thanks to the tax penalty on early withdrawals, my children will be discouraged from touching the money before they are 59&frac12;. There are far better investment vehicles than a variable annuity, and my chance came a few years ago. Hannah got a job at a local restaurant, which meant she had earned income. That allowed me to open a Roth individual retirement account for her, which will give Hannah tax-free growth. Instead, I could have funded a regular IRA, where withdrawals are taxable but you get an initial tax deduction. That tax deduction, however, wouldn't have been worth much, given Hannah's low tax rate, so the Roth seemed like a better bet. The money I've stashed in my kids' variable annuities and in Hannah's Roth IRA won't be nearly enough to pay for their retirement, especially once you figure in inflation. But fully funding their retirement was never my aim. Rather, the accounts are intended to be a powerful example, showing my children how money will grow if they are willing to sit quietly with a diverse collection of low-cost funds. When I bought my first home, my parents helped me financially, and I want to do the same for my kids. To that end, I have invested 15,000 for each of them. Even with a decade or more of growth, that 15,000 probably won't be nearly enough for a 20% down payment. But it will give them something to build on. I stashed Hannah's 15,000 in a target-date mutual fund that's geared toward 2010, while Henry's money is in a 2015 fund. I bought those funds knowing my kids probably won't buy homes until five or 10 years after those dates. My thinking: Target-date funds typically have around half their money in stocks as of their target date, and then they continue to become more conservative in the years that follow. By the time my kids need their down-payment money, their target-date funds should be largely invested in bonds. When my kids buy a house, they won't just need a down payment. They will also want to have a good credit score. With that in mind, I listed Hannah as a joint account holder on my Visa card earlier this year. That meant the card's credit history was added to her previously blank credit report. Suddenly, she looked like a model financial citizen. That allowed her, a few months later, to apply for a Discover card on her own. I now have her on a strict regimen, where she charges a small sum each month and dutifully pays it off, thus slowly building up a good credit score. When Henry reaches college age, I will go through the same nonsense with him. This, alas, is necessary nonsense. The reality is, a good credit score will help my kids get a lower mortgage rate, lower insurance premiums and a host of other financial benefits. Full disclosure: I am divorced. But even before my marriage broke up, I was horrified by the way many families blow 20,000 or 30,000 on a single day of celebration for a wedding. To put such spending in context, consider this: According to the Federal Reserve's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, more than 96% of households headed by someone 65 to 74 had some savings -- but the median value of these financial assets, including things like checking accounts, stocks and mutual funds, was just 36,100. Spending 30,000 on a party is not one of my values, and I've made sure my kids know it. I have told them I will give them 5,000 toward a wedding or at age 30, whichever comes first. What if they want the 30,000 wedding? They can ask their mother. While an expensive wedding is low on my list of priorities, a good education ranks near the top. My ex-wife and I long ago agreed that we would pay the full cost of our children's undergraduate education. Again, this was something my parents did for me, and we all tend to be heavily influenced by our parents' behavior. There is, however, a limit to my generosity. I have told Henry and Hannah that, if they want to go on to graduate school, they will have to take out loans. I may relent somewhat when the time comes. But I think that there should be some cost to staying in school, so I am not inclined to continue footing the full tab. As you might gather, I have talked to my kids a fair amount about money. They know they will graduate college debt-free, they will get some help toward a house down payment and they will receive just 5,000 toward a wedding. They know about the retirement accounts. I have also promised them 5,000 upon graduating college, to get them started in the world. No doubt some folks will think I'm overly generous, while others might consider me cheap. Many will question my priorities. For instance, folks have told me that they would have skipped the retirement accounts and allocated more toward a house down payment. But, frankly, the precise sums aren't that important. Instead, what I am striving to do is set expectations. By detailing everything to Henry and Hannah, I have made it clear where I think my financial responsibility ends and where theirs will begin. Along the way, I have also endeavored to teach my kids about sensible investing. It's been a slow process. For instance, earlier this decade, I tried a family investment contest. We all picked a mutual fund, I invested 50 a month in each and then we tracked who fared best. I thought the competition would grab their interest, but it wasn't a great success. Maybe Henry and Hannah were too young. Indeed, I have continued to show them their mutual-fund statements as they arrive in the mail, and my kids have grown more interested as they have grown older. They have also become more curious about the financial markets, and I can now chat about investing for at least 30 seconds before they reach for their iPods. I hope enough of this will stick, and they will grow up to be prudent managers of their own money. The potential savings are huge. A financial adviser might charge 1% of a portfolio's value each year, and then recommend mutual funds that cost another 1%. What if my children learn to build their own index-fund portfolios that cost a mere 0.2% a year? When their portfolios hit 1 million, they will pay just 2,000 a year in investment costs, instead of the 20,000 they would be paying if they used an adviser. And, with any luck, they will remember whom to thank. —Mr. Clements, who is based in New York, writes the Getting Going column for The Wall Street Journal.

Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes. As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.

(Photo credit: iamuday) China’s rise as an economic powerhouse is one of the happiest stories of modern times. Though its citizens once struggled in horrific ways under the brutal thumb of a totalitarian government, now its people are increasingly enjoying the fruits of capitalism. And while its naive detractors would say otherwise, capitalism loves poor people more than anyone as China’s leap from extreme poverty reveals. It’s also important to point out that China’s embrace of capitalism has been profoundly good for all Americans. Particularly amid our own difficult economic times, every day that the Chinese get up to go to work means Americans get a raise for Chinese workers producing all manner of products that cost us less and less as manufacture in China is perfected. That the Chinese have joined an increasingly integrated global economy also means that Americans have been able to migrate to higher paying jobs of the service variety thanks to the ability of Chinese workers to shoulder the manufacturing load of low value goods. Absent our sharing of labor with Chinese workers, Americans would have to do a lot of work that wouldn’t pay very well. To put it more simply, manufacture in China of shoes, socks and t-shirts means that Americans have the time to create Google Google, Microsoft Microsoft and Intel Intel. A better trading arrangement would be hard to fathom. Of course, China’s economic renaissance has predictably generated quite a lot of pessimism about its prospects within the commentariat. Editorial about a coming China ‘bubble’ is arguably as common as is commentary extolling the virtues of its real economic growth. On the ‘bubble’ front, what’s not infrequently mentioned is the existence of ‘ghost cities’ throughout the restless country. Those cities are apparently full of empty residential buildings, and it’s said that buildings without buyers are made possible by government driven loans. The thinking there is that with China’s government desperate to maintain high GDP growth, it’s essentially funding the building of anything so that GDP measures continue to soar. About all this Keynesian construction of buildings for the sake of it, China skeptics have a point; albeit one many of those same skeptics don’t quite grasp. Governments have no resources, so for them to direct limited capital toward activity of no discernible economic value is for governments to lay a wet blanket on actual growth. If the above is doubted, readers need only ask themselves who is better at allocating capital in the United States: Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Paul Tudor Jones, or Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, John Boehner, and Nancy Pelosi. The nature of the question makes for an easy answer, at which point it should be stressed to extent that some Chinese cities are entirely the creation of its GDP-focused government, their existence serves as physical evidence that China’s economy is performing at sub-optimal levels. Politicians are many things, but they’re not skilled investors. By definition. The problem with this ankle-biting about China is that it largely ignores the ‘Ghost Country’ that is the United States. This assertion is in no way meant to dismiss the very real economic activity taking place all over the U.S. Lest we forget, governments have no resources other than that which they tax and borrow from us. For our government to spend with abandon, it must be true that Americans are enormously productive such that our wasteful federal minders can tax and borrow away our wealth to begin with. Still, we’re once again a ghost country, and some of our phantoms don’t even live within the 50 states. To see how this is true, consider the military. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon has warned that cuts in defense spending “would cripple our economy” owing to the sad reality that so many owe their paycheck and their business to defense outlays. If we ignore first how very Keynesian many Republicans have become on the subject of defense spending, at present our military protects some of the richest countries in the world in Europe and Asia. For those who saw the documentary, Restrepo, they’re aware that a major part of our military strategy in Afghanistan involves bribing the warlords with jobs programs. Is a great deal of defense spending the wasteful equivalent of ‘Ghost Cities’? It says here that it is. Laws and regulations don’t work at all as evidenced by the collapse of the heavily regulated banking sector in 2008, but all the rules that are legislated and written by politicians and bureaucrats have created massive special interest groups of the accountant, consultant and lawyer variety whose paychecks are almost totally a function of incomprehensible tax and regulatory codes. Without our tax system and a Federal Register that grows by leaps and bounds year after year, each of these facilitator professions would vanish for the most part. Another proverbial ‘Ghost City’ created by our federal government. What about corporate welfare? From subsidies for rich farmers, loans to well-connected businesses like Solyndra, to myriad tax breaks for all sorts of commercial activity approved by Congress, the cost of handouts to corporations is said to run upwards of 160 billion per year. And with Washington, D.C. the center of all this government largesse, cranes are everywhere as developers erect office and residential buildings meant to house and office all those rushing into our capitol city to get a piece of the wealth siphoned off from the actual wealth producers who don’t live in Washington, D.C.; D.C. the Mother of all Ghost Cities. All of which brings us to federal spending itself. This is important when we consider the Keynesian, and as such, very worthless calculation of economic growth that is GDP. The latter counts government spending as an additive aspect of economic growth even though our government can only spend what it takes from the rest of us first. U.S. GDP is measured at around 15 trillion, and government spending accounts for more than a fifth of that 15 trillion. No doubt some of that spending serves an actual and useful constitutional purpose, but a vastly greater amount of it constitutes spending and favor-giving that has no economic raison d’etre other than propping up the proverbial ‘Ghost Cities’ in the U.S., and well outside our borders. It’s arguably true that China’s government has used funds taken from its citizens to build that which has no purpose, but when it comes to creating the most garish of ‘Ghost Cities,’ our own United States has no equal. Summary:","response":"The article discusses the comparison between China's 'Ghost Cities' and the 'Ghost Country' status of the United States. While China's economic growth has been labelled a 'bubble' with many empty residential buildings funded by government-driven loans, the US has its share of issues as well, with military spending, corporate welfare, and federal spending propping up economically unviable projects and sectors.

Option 1: Raid your neighbors flower beds, and take their plants out of their containers. Step 1: Consider the ethics. Raiding your neighbors' flower beds would involve trespassing and theft, which is illegal and ethically wrong. Step 2: Consider the effect on the relationship with neighbors. Adopting this approach would strain your relationship with neighbors and create a hostile environment. Step 3: Assess the feasibility. Taking plants out of their containers will not help with seed starting, as plants have already matured past the seed starting stage. Option 2: Save your egg shells, and fill with potting soil. Step 1: Gather egg shells. After using eggs for cooking or baking, clean and dry the shells, then save them for this project. Step 2: Prepare the egg shells. Carefully create a small hole in the bottom of the shells for drainage. Step 3: Fill the egg shells with potting soil. Use a spoon or a small trowel to fill the shells with soil, leaving a small space at the top. Step 4: Plant seeds. Place seeds in the soil according to their planting instructions, usually no more than 1-2 seeds per egg shell. Step 5: Care for the seedlings. Water the seeds lightly and place them in a sunny location, watching for signs of growth. As an AI, I see that Option 2 is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of DIY seed starters. Here's the justification: - Option 2 is ethical, as it does not involve taking anything from someone else. - Option 2 is environment-friendly since it repurposes egg shells and avoids plastic containers. - Option 2 promotes a sustainable and resourceful gardening practice. - Option 2 focuses on starting seeds, whereas Option 1 involves taking already developed plants. Therefore, I recommend choosing Option 2, \\"Save your egg shells, and fill with potting soil,\\" as it aligns with the goal of DIY seed starters and is the most ethical and sustainable method of the two options."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

Olfaction is an important sensory system for detecting chemical cues called pheromones, which are signaling molecules released into the environment by individuals within a species. These pheromones carry important information about the physical condition, sexual receptivity, and genetic compatibility of the individual releasing them. During the mating season, potential mates release these chemical signals to attract suitable partners. In many species, male salamanders perform courtship displays that involve releasing specific pheromones, which the female can detect using her sense of smell. Once these chemical cues have been detected, the female will follow the scent trail to track down the male to initiate mating. The male will then guide her to a suitable nest while continuing to release pheromones to maintain her interest. While the other options listed - sound, seduction, fur and fat, heat energy, air, environment, and water—may play a part in the life of a salamander, they do not directly contribute to mate-finding in the same way that olfaction does. Some of these aspects, such as water and environment, may affect the overall habitat and conditions for salamanders, while factors such as heat energy and air may impact their activity levels. However, olfaction remains the primary means by which salamanders identify and locate a mate. In conclusion, among the given options, most salamanders use olfaction as the primary method to find a mate. Their sense of smell allows them to accurately detect and interpret chemical signals, particularly pheromones, released by potential mates, which in turn helps them recognize and locate suitable partners for reproduction. This chemical communication through olfaction is a crucial part of the courtship and mating process for salamanders."},{"question":"A new mandate will now be given to the party formed and led by incumbent Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg.

The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries. He was to have carried \\"some of the finest...

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the review, it's quite difficult to determine whether or not I would recommend this app to a friend as the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam\\" doesn't provide any concrete details about the app, its features, or the reviewer's experience with it. There's no evaluation of the app's performance, user interface, functionality, or overall satisfaction from the user. The review is minimal and unclear in expressing any feelings or feedback to understand the app. Furthermore, without any knowledge of the app in question, its purpose, target audience, or its competition, it's hard to make a recommendation. It's important to understand what the app does, how it performs, its customer satisfaction, and its standing in the marketplace to make an informed decision. However, let's analyze different recommendation scenarios by breaking them down: 1. Not at all: If the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam\\" was a negative comment or complaint about the app, it could be an indication to not recommend the app to a friend. But, since the context of the statement is not clear, we cannot assume it is a negative review and base our recommendation on that assumption. 2. No: If the app's functions were deemed subpar or not fulfilling the user's needs, the recommendation might be \\"No.\\" However, as we don't have enough information from the review, it is not possible to determine the app's functionality and performance. 3. Maybe: A \\"Maybe\\" recommendation might be given to an app with mixed reviews, or one that fulfills certain niche needs. Since we lack detailed information about the app's performance and its overall impact on the user, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation could potentially be given, considering the uncertainty. 4. Yes: A \\"Yes\\" recommendation implies that the app is good, provides valuable features, and addresses the user's needs. Since the review doesn't provide any information on whether the app fulfills these criteria, it's hard to definitively say \\"Yes.\\" 5. Definitely: A \\"Definitely\\" recommendation means the app has met or exceeded the user's expectations and provides an excellent user experience. Again, the review doesn't provide enough information to justify a strong recommendation. In conclusion, based solely on the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam,\\" a definitive recommendation cannot be made. To provide a better recommendation, more in-depth reviews and detailed analysis of the app's features and performance would be necessary. For now, the most suitable response would be \\"Maybe,\\" bearing in mind the limited information available. It is advisable to do more research and gather additional user reviews to get a clearer picture of the app's quality before making a recommendation."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the most common but not long lasting side effect of having a bath?

It includes proposals for new roads, airstrips, dams and changes to land-use laws to allow more development. But one Aboriginal leader said he feared the proposal was a \\"Trojan horse\\" to undermine native title. The government's white paper was a \\"welcome focus on the north\\" said Noel Pearson, an influential Aboriginal leader from Cape York in far north Queensland. \\"But this approach is full of threat and full of opportunity,\\" said Mr Pearson. Speaking on Australia's ABC TV on Friday, he said: \\"Our concern is that governments, including the Commonwealth, see this as a Trojan horse to undermine Mabo.\\" He was referring to the landmark 1992 court ruling recognising native title in Australia. Native title recognises the traditional rights and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to land and waters they can prove a long-standing connection to but does not extinguish freehold title or pastoral leases. Mr Pearson warned the government it must negotiate with Aboriginal people, who make up a large part of the north's population and own much of the land under native title. He said there was a big chance developers would try to \\"sideline\\" Aboriginal concerns and that they would end up with \\"scraps off the table\\" of any major development. The government's plan, launched officially on Friday, includes a A600m (545m; Â£343m) roads package to upgrade transport infrastructure, and a A200m water infrastructure fund. Land-use laws in the north have led to long delays and cost blowouts in construction and mining projects over the past decade, so the white paper includes support for native title bodies and new surveys to start simplifying land arrangements. Governments have talked in the past of opening up the north of Australia to more development, especially agriculture. However, monsoonal weather in some parts of the region, very dry weather elsewhere, and poor soils have been seen as barriers to successful large-scale farming.

Movie title: The Kingdom Movie plot: The opening scene of the movie explains how oil drilling has transformed the Middle East and abroad in a timeline sequence. It portrays the conflicts that have risen since the late 1940's for the rightful ownership of the Oil Industry. This includes the United States's involvement in Iraq and al-Qaeda's growing network of terrorism. Eventually, it explains the 9/11 terrorism attacks and how 80% of the hijackers were Saudis. This raises serious questions on the relationship between Saudi and the United States. The plot begins with the current struggle of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom's efforts to stand control of their country against terrorist extremists.During a game of softball played by American citizens in their oil company's housing compound, terrorists set off a bomb, killing many Americans, as well as Saudi State Police. The terrorists impersonated Saudi State Police members and while one team hijacked a car and started shooting residents of the area, another runs out onto the baseball diamond, pretending to aid the Americans, but then reveals that he is a suicide bomber and blows himself up, along with everyone near him. Sergeant Haytham of the Saudi State Police, disables the stolen SSP vehicle and kills the occupants. The FBI's Legal Attache in Saudi Arabia, Special Agent Francis Manner, calls up his colleague Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) to tell him about the attack. Shortly after this a second bomb explodes in the compound killing more people, including Manner.Back in the U.S., Fleury briefs his FBI team on the happenings in the Kingdom, and Special Agent Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), a forensic examiner, breaks down in tears upon hearing of Francis's death.

In this case, the years which are divisible by 4 but not by 100 are leap years. However, additional leap years are considered if they are divisible by 400. We will apply this rule to find out the number of leap years in the 20th century. The 20th century covers the years from 1901 to 2000. We will first find the leap years that are divisible by 4: 1901 ÷ 4 = 475.25 (not divisble) 1902 ÷ 4 = 475.5 (not divisble) 1903 ÷ 4 = 475.75 (not divisble) 1904 ÷ 4 = 476 (divisible) 1905 ÷ 4 = 476.25 (not divisible) ... 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (divisible) Since the common difference between the elements is 4 (1904, 1908, 1912, and so on), we can use the arithmetic series formula to determine the last term of the series, which is 2000. The formula is: an = a1 + (n - 1) * d where \\"an\\" is the last term (2000), \\"a1\\" is the first term (1904), \\"n\\" represents the number of terms in the series, and \\"d\\" is the common difference (4). Rearranging the formula: n = (an - a1) ÷ d + 1 = (2000 - 1904) ÷ 4 + 1 n = 96 ÷ 4 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 So, there are 25 leap years divisible by 4 in the 20th century. Now, we need to find the leap years divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. From 1901 to 2000, only 1900 and 2000 are divisible by 100. Among these numbers, 2000 is divisible by 400 (2000 ÷ 400 = 5). Thus, 1900 is the only year in this group. But, since we are counting leap years from 1901 to 2000, we don't need to consider 1900. Thus, there are 25 leap years divisible by 4, and no years divisible by 100 but not by 400.

Review: These sticks chew up easily during rimshots and cymbal work. That in itself is a deal breaker. Add to that poor balance, and vibration transmission and you have a total loser of a drum stick. Answer: Answer:","response":"Upon analyzing the given product review, it is evident that this review is negative. The title \\"AWFUL!\\" indicates strong dissatisfaction, which suggests a negative experience with the product. Furthermore, the reviewer highlights multiple issues they have faced while using the drum sticks, which can be broken down into the following points: 1. The sticks are easily damaged during rimshots and cymbal work. This demonstrates that the product is of low durability and not suitable for the demands of regular drumming. Such a drawback can negatively impact the user's experience and the overall performance of the drumsticks. 2. Poor balance has been mentioned as another issue. A pair of drumsticks that is not well-balanced can hinder the drummer's ability to maintain proper technique and achieve the desired sound. This would cause frustration for the user and may also lead to an inefficient performance. 3. The third issue mentioned is the vibration transmission, which implies that the drumsticks inadequately absorb vibrations. Consequently, the user may experience discomfort, pain, or numbness in their hands while playing, making it difficult to play for extended durations or at the desired intensity. In conclusion, this product review is negative based on the various issues highlighted by the reviewer. They express their dissatisfaction with the drumsticks' poor durability, balance, and vibration transmission, ultimately describing the product as a \\"total loser.\\" Such a strong negative sentiment confirms that the reviewer had a disappointing experience with the drumsticks and does not recommend them to others."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step in the following process is selecting a suitable suitcase or luggage for your travel needs. This step is essential as it sets the foundation for efficient and organized packing. Here's a detailed description of this first step: 1. Selecting a suitable suitcase or luggage: Before packing, the first thing to consider is choosing an appropriate suitcase or luggage that meets your travel requirements. Depending on the specific nature of your trip, the duration of your stay, and the mode of transportation, the type of luggage will vary. - Luggage size: Pick a luggage size that corresponds to the length and purpose of your trip. For a short weekend getaway, a small carry-on might be sufficient, whereas a larger suitcase or duffel bag would be more appropriate for a longer vacation or when traveling with family. - Luggage style: Choose between different luggage styles, such as hardshell suitcases, soft-sided suitcases, duffel bags, or backpacks. Hardshell cases usually provide better protection for your belongings but may weigh more and have less flexibility. Soft cases can be more lightweight and flexible, making them an attractive option for travelers who need to pack a lot into a small space. - Wheel and handle options: Decide whether you need luggage with wheels to make it easier to maneuver through airports or bus/train stations, or if a simple backpack or duffel will suffice. For luggage with wheels, consider getting one with four wheels for easier movement in any direction, as opposed to two-wheeled luggage which requires you to tilt and pull. - Accessibility and compartments: It is essential to look for a suitcase or luggage with various pockets and compartments to store and organize your belongings effectively. Separating your clothes, toiletries, and other essential items in different compartments will make it easier and faster to find what you need during your trip. - Durability and weight: Choose a suitcase made of high-quality materials, such as ballistic nylon or polycarbonate, that will withstand rough handling during transportation. Ensure it is lightweight enough to avoid exceeding baggage weight limits and reduce strain on your body when lifting or carrying it. Once you have selected the appropriate suitcase or luggage, you can proceed with the steps mentioned in the question, starting with packing essential items such as underwear and socks, followed by weather-appropriate clothing, jackets, and a semi-formal outfit. Finally, zip up the bag, and you are ready to go."},{"question":"Judd Family 'Angry and Hurt' About Ashley's Memoir Shockers Email This Ashley Judd's shocking \\"How she could betray her own flesh and blood with this disturbed view of what happened is shocking and hurtful,\\" a Judd family insider tells me. \\"These ugly family accusations should be discussed in private within the family, not printed and sold to the public to make a quick buck.\\" Ashley Judd's shocking memoir telling all about her famous family has her mother, country legend Naomi Judd, and singing sister Wynonna fighting mad.\\"How she could betray her own flesh and blood with this disturbed view of what happened is shocking and hurtful,\\" a Judd family insider tells me. \\"These ugly family accusations should be discussed in private within the family, not printed and sold to the public to make a quick buck.\\" Ashley didn't hold anything back, claiming she was sexually abused and left with caregivers who used drugs, highlighting a childhood filled with neglect, abuse and deep depression.\\"My mother, while she was transforming herself into the country legend Naomi Judd, created an origin myth for the Judds that did not match my reality,\\" the actress writes. \\"I loved my mother, but at the same time I dreaded the mayhem and uncertainty that followed her everywhere.

A summerlong crackdown on cybercrime has resulted in arrests or convictions of more than 150 individuals, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced Thursday.","response":"This particular topic is about a major operation led by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to crack down on cybercrime during a summer season. The operation led to the arrest or conviction of over 150 people involved in various forms of cybercrime activities. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced the results of this operation on a Thursday. To provide more context to this event, cybercrime refers to the use of computer systems, networks, and the internet to commit illegal or criminal activities. Cybercrime has grown rapidly in recent years, posing significant threats to individuals, businesses, and government institutions across the world. It can take various forms such as hacking, identity theft, online fraud, and distribution of child pornography. The DOJ, under the leadership of Attorney General John Ashcroft, launched this crackdown to address the rising concerns related to cybercrime incidents. The crackdown involved the participation and coordination of various federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities. These authorities worked together to identify, track, and apprehend individuals who engaged in cybercrimes. They also aimed to dismantle any networks or organizations that were responsible for coordinating and supporting these criminal activities. The targets of this crackdown included both domestic and international cybercriminal groups. The arrests and convictions involved individuals who were found participating in various illegal activities that took place in the cyberspace. Some of the key criminal activities targeted during the operation included: 1. Hacking incidents: This involves unauthorized intrusion into computer systems and networks to steal sensitive information or disrupt normal operations of businesses, individuals, or other entities. 2. Identity theft: This type of cybercrime involves obtaining and using someone's personal information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card information, or other sensitive data without the owner's consent. This information can then be used to conduct fraudulent activities or even extortion. 3. Online fraud: This includes activities such as financial scams, phishing schemes, and various other forms of deception that can result in financial losses or the abuse of personal information. 4. Distribution of child pornography: This involves the production, distribution, or possession of explicit materials involving minors, which is illegal under federal law. As a result of these combined efforts, over 150 individuals were arrested or convicted for their actions that were identified during the summer operation. This significant achievement demonstrates both the effectiveness of coordinated law enforcement efforts and the serious measures taken by the DOJ to tackle the growing problem of cybercrime. Attorney General John Ashcroft's announcement of this crackdown highlights the government's commitment to addressing cybercrime and protecting the privacy, security, and well-being of individuals and organizations who rely on computer networks and the internet for their daily activities. This operation also serves as a warning to cybercriminals and an assurance to citizens that the government will continue to take necessary actions to combat and deter cybercrime activities."},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: 24:11Andhemadehiscamelstokneeldownwithoutthecitybyawellofwateratthetimeoftheevening,eventhetimethatwomengoouttodrawwater.","response":"To add spaces to the given text, I will follow these steps: 1.

The Yum Brands subsidiary is spitting out 185 million to reboot its business, which includes sprucing up some of its 4,300 stores, pushing new Deep South fare, and bringing back in TV ads what a press release calls the \\"brand's greatest asset\\": the ever-popular Colonel Sanders, who died in 1980 and hasn't been seen in a KFC ad in two decades. \\"The Colonel was the consummate American showman,\\" KFC's marketing head tells the Post. \\"He was the person with bling before bling was even a word.\\" For now, KFC is bringing him back to life through SNL alum Darrell Hammond, who issued a \\"State of Kentucky Fried Chicken Address\\" as the colonel in a promo KFC tweeted out May 19. There's also what Adweek calls an \\"oddly educational\\" Hall of Colonels website and even a Colonel Quest video game. Response on social media has been … mixed. Comments range from excited (\\"@kfc Excellent tv spots! The Colonel is still an excellent spokesman!\\") to disgusted (\\"@kfc I find this extremely offensive to the memory of Colonel Sander I'm going to Popeyes\\") to flat-out frightened (\\"Get outta my timeline with your zombie Colonel selling fried death\\"). But will KFC be bowing to the healthy-eating trend that forced McDonald's to start testing kale in its offerings? Doesn't look that way, the Post notes, though the chain will be using chicken \\"traceability\\" boards in restaurants to say where local chicken came from. Expand this summary.","response":"KFC has recently decided to revive Colonel Sanders, its founder who died in 1980, as part of a 185 million effort to reboot its business and compete with rival fast-food chains like Chick-fil-A. The Yum Brands subsidiary is spending the money on refurbishing some of its 4,300 stores, promoting new Deep South fare, and creating TV ads featuring the popular Colonel Sanders. The late founder of the business will be portrayed by Saturday Night Live star Darrell Hammond, who hosted a \\"State of Kentucky Fried Chicken Address\\" as the Colonel on May 19th. The resurrection of Colonel Sanders will also include an \\"oddly educational\\" Hall of Colonels website and a Colonel Quest video game. In addition to reviving Colonel Sanders to boost brand awareness, KFC has been adopting various strategies to turn their business around. Contrary to the healthy-eating trends pursued by some of its fast-food rivals, such as McDonald's testing the use of kale in its products, KFC is focusing on its core product offering: fried chicken. They believe that there are \\"few problems a bucket of fried chicken can't solve\\" and that their customers are looking for \\"something indulgent and something they can share with their family and friends.\\" It remains to be seen if these strategies, along with the better marketing of its products, will enable KFC to regain its market share from Chick-fil-A and other competitors. KFC is also introducing \\"chicken traceability\\" boards in its restaurants in an effort to become more transparent about where the chain sources its chickens. This move could prove fruitful as consumers become increasingly concerned about the origins of the food they consume. Overall, KFC's combination of nostalgia and transparency has the potential to improve the customer experience, enticing both old and new customers to give the chain a try (or a second chance)."},{"question":"How is \\"These are limited to Can60 billion by Order-in-Council dated 26 April 2001.\\" said in French?","response":"To translate the given sentence into French, I will follow these steps: 1.

Intercut is a sequence of images of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a crippled war veteran and former Marine. He wakes up in a giant spaceship on its way to Pandora, a lush Earth-like moon orbiting Polyphemus, a blue planet similar to Jupiter.

Then, through voice-over and flashback with hospital and military officials, we learn that Jake has a deceased twin brother -- Tom, a scientist -- who was to be part of a high-level program overseen by corporate and military strategists. Because Jake and his brother are an exact genetic match, he was presented with a unique opportunity: take over his brother's contract with a corporate-military entity and travel light years away to an outpost on the previously glimpsed world, Pandora.

(AP) — A youth hockey team escaped without injury when part of a snow-weighted roof collapsed at a skating rink on Saturday morning, officials said. Police in Canton said the rear portion of the roof at the Metropolis Skating Rink began to fail as a Norwood youth team was inside, but they were able to get out along with parents and rink workers. All are safe and accounted for. Norwood Nuggets coach Chris Sharkey told Boston’s WBZ-AM that some children were in the locker room and some were on the ice, “and then we heard a snap and knew something was wrong. “We started to get off the ice and started screaming for all the kids, and the second snap came,” Sharkey said. “Then just it turned into complete ‘get off the ice as quick as possible and get these kids out of the structure’,” he said. Canton Fire Chief Charlie Doody told the Patriot Ledger of Quincy a coach was propelled across the rink by air pressure from the collapse, which also damaged part of the building’s front facade. Doody said things could have been much worse if the collapse had happened a couple hours later. “At 9 a.m. there were going to be 200 to 300 kids for Learn to Skate. We could have potentially had a very different situation,” he said. Lynn Valkanas was outside the rink later with her 9-year-old daughter, Laura, a goalie from Canton who was supposed to have attended the 9 a.m. ceremonial free skate on the last day of skating class. “This is scary,” the girl told the newspaper. “It’s sad.

Eastern Orthodox Church: A Christian denomination with deep historical roots, which originated in the eastern part of the Roman Empire. 2. Byzantine Empire: The political entity that emerged from the eastern part of the Roman Empire after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It existed from approximately 330 to 1453 AD. 3. Calendar: A system of organizing and measuring time, usually based on the relative positions of celestial bodies such as the sun and moon. Now let's address the question: \\"Did the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Empire ever use the same calendar?\\" Step 1: Identify the calendar used by the Byzantine Empire. To understand the calendar used during the Byzantine Empire, we must first recognize that this empire was a direct continuation of the older Eastern Roman Empire. Throughout its existence, the Byzantine Empire used the Julian calendar, which was initially introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC. Step 2: Identify the calendar used by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Similarly, the Eastern Orthodox Church also used the Julian calendar. As it was the predominant Christian denomination in the Byzantine Empire, it adopted the same calendrical system as the political entity in which it was situated. Step 3: Compare the calendars. Since both the Byzantine Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church used the Julian calendar throughout their historical coexistence, we can conclude that they indeed used the same calendar. Final answer: Yes, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Empire did use the same calendar, which was the Julian calendar."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Harry Brown is an elderly pensioner who was once a decorated soldier in the Royal Marines, and a veteran of Northern Ireland.

His wife is laid to rest next to the grave of their thirteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died in 1973. Len confides to Harry that he is being terrorized by youths and shows him an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself; with the police unable to help, he plans to confront his harassers himself. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock, who tell him that Len has been murdered. The police arrest Noel Winters, the leader of a drug-dealing gang, along with members Carl, Dean and Marky, but are released due to lack of evidence. Harry gets drunk after Len's funeral, and is then held at knife-point by Dean, who intends to rob him; Harry kills Dean with his own knife during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry in the morning to inform him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defense, leaving Harry feeling angry and betrayed. Harry follows a drug dealer, Kenny, to a den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch, growing cannabis and sexually abusing an overdosing girl to make pornographic films. Harry kills the dealers before burning down their den, fleeing with the girl and a bag of firearms in a stolen Land Rover. He leaves the girl outside a hospital, and later follows Marky to find him being sexually abused by Troy Martindale, a heroin smuggler that supplies drugs to the gang. Harry shoots and kills Martindale and captures Marky, whom he tortures into...

The rating means 1: extremely poor, 2: poor, 3: neutral, 4: good, 5: extremely good. Your task is to generate whether the rating matches the review or not. Answer with \\"True\\" if the sentence belongs to that section, otherwise answer with \\"False\\" Input: Review: I received this today and am new to the product. I ignored the negative reviews thinking it had so many good reviews. I do not know what the consistency is supposed to be like but I know I do not like this. It is like pouring water out of a container. There is no thickness to the product and is like the bubble mixture you make for kids to blow bubbles with dish soap. I ordered two scents. Diva smelled fine. High Maintenance smelled like bug spray. I did a load of laundry and spilled way too much detergent into the wash because of consistency. I say this because there was no smell on the clothes when removing them from the washing machine. I would spend way too much money on something that smells good and lasts. That brand promise is exciting. I do not know if this is how it is supposed to be or if in fact this is not the real product. I cannot imagine wanting to purchase this product based on this. Maybe someone can tell me if this is how it is supposed to be and if so, how do I have any success with the product? Thanks! Rating: 1 Output:","response":"True Explanation: This task is asking you to read an Amazon product review and determine if the given rating matches the sentiments expressed in the review. The rating scale is from 1 to 5, with 1 being extremely poor and 5 being extremely good. In this case, the review is largely negative, with criticism about the product's consistency, scent, and effectiveness. The reviewer even questions whether the product received is the real product. Because of these expressed issues, the rating given is 1, which means extremely poor. So you are asked to decide if this rating is appropriate based on the content of the review. As the review is hugely negative, it indicates the reviewer had a poor experience with the product, hence the rating of 1 is appropriate. Therefore, your answer should be \\"True\\", as the rating accurately reflects the content and tone of the review."},{"question":"New York City: New York City is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military's only active duty installation within the city.

Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney told BBC Wales the Â£55m daily cost could go to schools and hospitals. AM Eluned Parrott, speaking for Britain Stronger in Europe, hailed cheaper and more secure food supplies. With a referendum called for 23 June, three of the Tories' 11 Welsh MPs have said they want the UK to leave, while all 25 Welsh Labour MPs want to remain. David Cameron confirmed the date of the vote after negotiating a deal in Brussels which gives the UK the right to restrict EU migrants' benefits and to be excused from taking part in \\"ever-closer union\\". Debating the arguments on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, both Ms Bilney and Ms Parrott claimed the terms of trade would be better under their preferred option. Ms Bilney said the UK would be free to negotiate its own trade deals outside the EU, while the Lib Dem AM said there was a benefit from being part of the world's biggest single market. Ms Parrott also pointed to the EU as a force for peace over 60 years, while Ms Bilney said the UK's membership of Nato, the UN security council and friendship with the USA provided security. Elsewhere, deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told the party's Welsh conference in Llandudno that the UK would remain in the EU but winning the referendum would not be easy. \\"The Tories could end up destroying themselves over Europe but we won't let them destroy our country\\", he said. Monmouth Tory MP David Davies told BBC Wales that he would be \\"campaigning hard\\" for the UK to leave the EU, describing Mr Watson's view as \\"wishful thinking\\". He said the Conservative Party would be united irrespective of the referendum result - but he hoped the result would mean the UK was no longer part of the EU. Mr Davies is one of three of the 11 Welsh Tory MPs who have said they will vote for Britain to leave the EU - former Welsh Secretary David Jones and Brecon and Radnorshire MP Chris Davies are the others. Five have declared in favour of remaining in the EU - Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, Guto Bebb, Byron Davies, Simon Hart and Craig Williams. Three have yet to declare their view - junior Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns, Glyn Davies and James Davies. Plaid Cymru confirmed that the party and its three MPs would be campaigning to stay in the EU. \\"We have to see the big picture,\\" said Euro-MP Jill Evans. \\"There is a lot we would like to change about the EU, but we can only do that from within. The decision we make is about the kind of Wales we want to build and will affect generations to come.\\" Wales is slightly different to the rest of the UK. Areas like west Wales and the valleys get hundreds of millions of pounds in EU aid, far more than any other part of the UK. Between 2014 and 2020 that is going to be worth Â£2bn. Farmers here share in another Â£200m of EU payments a year, which could be lost if the UK opts to leave. However, those who want to leave the EU say it is not \\"European\\" money, but our money. They insist the money could still go to poorer areas of Wales - it would just come from the Welsh government rather than Brussels. However, we have yet to see any concrete plans that the UK government would be willing to send additional money to Wales in the event of Brexit. Summary:","response":"The UK votes for leaving or remaining in the EU in June, with disagreement on the benefits of staying or leaving impacting areas such as trade, migration, and security."},{"question":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Step 1: Evaluate the given statement. \\"The bat isn't new.\\" indicates that the bat is not in a condition one would consider brand new. This could be due to the bat being used, aged, or simply not meeting the conditions for something to be considered new. Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between the given statement and the conclusions. (A). This conclusion assumes that since the bat is not new, it must be worn or visibly used. While this could be true in some cases, there could be other factors contributing to the bat not being considered new (e.g. being a display item or having minor cosmetic defects). This assumption may not be universally true. (B). This conclusion acknowledges that there is uncertainty in determining whether the bat is worn, based solely on the information provided. This conclusion is most reflective of the information given. (C). This conclusion assumes that one can definitively determine that the bat is not worn based on the information provided.

Once upon a time in a faraway land called Scotland, there were two teams that loved to play a game called cricket. One day, the Scottish team invited their friends from Namibia to come and play with them. They were all very excited! When the day came, both teams were ready to have lots and lots of fun. They hoped that the sun would shine brightly all day long, but Mother Nature had other plans. The game began, and just when it was getting more and more exciting, the rain started to fall. Oh no! You see, when it rains, it's hard to play cricket because the ground becomes slippery, and the ball gets too wet to throw. Both teams decided it was best to wait for the rain to stop. They waited and waited, but the rain wasn't going away anytime soon. So, they thought, \\"Let's take a break and continue the game tomorrow!\\" The next day, the teams arrived at the field, hoping for a sunny day. Fortunately, the sun was shining again, and they could continue their friendly match. Both teams were eager to win, but cricket can be tricky sometimes. They had to use something called the \\"Duckworth-Lewis Method\\" because they couldn't finish the game as planned due to the rain. The Duckworth-Lewis Method is like a magical rule in cricket that helps decide who wins the game when it rains. It looks at how many runs each team got and how many players were left. This way, it's fair for both teams even if they didn't get to play the full game. When they used this special method, Scotland won the game! They beat Namibia by 51 runs, which means they scored 51 more points than their friends from Namibia. Even though they didn't get to finish the whole game, both teams had a fantastic time and celebrated together. In the end, they all learned that sometimes things don't go as planned, like the rainy weather, but that's okay! They can always find a way to make the best of the situation and have a great time together. And that's the story of how Scotland won a very special game of cricket against Namibia on a rainy day!"},{"question":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Lauren Fenmore.

Across all their mines, 10% of their output is nickel, 60% is iron, and the rest is copper. They mine 720 tons of nickel a day. How many tons of copper does Big Dig Mining Company mine daily? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the total daily output of ore Big Dig Mining Company mines 10% nickel, which comes out to 720 tons a day. To find the percentage of output that nickel makes up for the company, we'll use the formula: Total output = (Output of nickel) / (Percentage of nickel output as a decimal) Total output = (720 tons) / (0.1) Total output = 7200 tons Step 2: Calculate the percentage of copper mined daily The company mines 60% iron and the rest of the output is copper. We know that the total output is 100%, so we can now calculate the percentage of copper production: Percentage of copper output = Total output - (Percentage of iron output + Percentage of nickel output) Percentage of copper output = 100% - (60% + 10%) Percentage of copper output = 100% - 70% Percentage of copper output = 30% Step 3: Calculate the daily production of copper Now that we know that 30% of the output is copper, we can calculate the actual daily production of copper: Daily production of copper = (Total output) * (Percentage of copper output as a decimal) Daily production of copper = (7200 tons) * (0.3) Daily production of copper = 2160 tons Big Dig Mining Company mines 2160 tons of copper daily."},{"question":"for benyamine and hennigan this tournament is right in their wheel-house, as both players are considered excellent all-around players.

To friends and strangers hiding with them. With their lives at stake, they spoke quietly and tried to decide: When do we run for it? Sara Head of Washington hid in a stairwell. Uche Kaigwa-Okoye's place of refuge was a stall in a ladies' restroom. Zulobia Kassam was in the back of a supermarket. Each was lucky enough never to see any of the gunmen who killed dozens in the upscale Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, on Saturday. But not seeing their attackers was itself part of the terror.","response":"The chilling day at Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, unfolded into a nightmarish, four-day siege, as gunmen refused to surrender and continued to take hostages. Kenyan security forces ultimately stormed the mall in a final, desperate attempt to free as many people as possible. During the harrowing hours that followed, Sara Head, Uche Kaigwa-Okoye, Zulobia Kassam, and other survivors hunkered down in fear, praying for their lives and the lives of those they could hear being hunted down. As the ordeal continued, security forces and police conducted several successful rescue operations, many under the cover of darkness. Coordination among the rescue teams was critical to accomplishing this, with private security and civilian volunteers playing a vital role. Bravery was not uncommon among trapped individuals, with accounts of utter selflessness and heroism gaining traction in the media. Sara Head's hiding place in the stairwell ultimately proved to be a wise choice. The sounds of commotion grew louder, but the gunmen never crossed paths with her. Eventually, security forces made their way through the mall, section by section, and led her to safety. Uche Kaigwa-Okoye's ordeal in a ladies' restroom was nerve-wracking, but she too managed to avoid confrontation with the killers. As the hours dragged on, she discovered a vent in one of the stalls. Determined to escape, she scrambled through it and found herself in an adjacent, less frequented area. This decision may have saved her life and allowed her to escape the mall relatively unharmed. Zulobia Kassam, who hid in the back of a supermarket, knew that keeping her composure was crucial. As people around her were taken hostage or killed, she steeled herself and did her best to remain silent. Her perseverance paid off when she heard the rescue team approaching her location. She cautiously moved closer to them, signaling her presence and was quickly reunited with her family, safe and sound. After four days of terror, the Kenyan security forces finally declared the siege over. It had been a grueling, blood-soaked affair, with the death toll reaching around 70 people and hundreds more injured. In a statement to the nation, President Uhuru Kenyatta mourned the loss of so many innocent lives and vowed to fight terrorism in the country. The attack left a lasting impact on the people of Nairobi, but also brought forth countless acts of heroism, solidarity, and humanity. Sara, Uche, and Zulobia, along with many others who survived the Westgate Mall attack, would ultimately begin the process of healing, supported by communities that rallied around them. It would undoubtedly take time for them to recover from the trauma, from their fear and the terrible tales they heard while hidden. But their stories of survival would serve as a testament to human resilience and a reminder that in the darkest moments, courage and hope can still shine through."},{"question":"Question.

We are given that Alexiev and Sabrina are both starting with pure water and performing different experimental protocols. 2. At the end of the experiment, Alexiev has a high concentration of hydronium ions, while Sabrina has a low concentration of hydronium ions. 3. Hydronium ions (H3O+) are responsible for the acidic taste in aqueous solutions. 4. A high concentration of hydronium ions would lead to a more acidic and sour taste. 5.

Gage (1823-1860) was an American railroad construction foreman remembered for his improbable[B1]:19 survival of an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior over the remaining 12 years of his life--effects sufficiently profound (for a time at least) that friends saw him as \\"no longer Gage\\". [H]:14 Long known as the \\"American Crowbar Case\\"--once termed \\"the case which more than all others is calculated to excite our wonder, impair the value of prognosis, and even to subvert our physiological doctrines\\" --Phineas Gage influenced 19th-century discussion about the mind and brain, particularly debate on cerebral localization, [M]:ch7-9[B] and was perhaps the first case to suggest the brain's role in determining personality, and that damage to specific parts of the brain might induce specific personality changes. [M]:1,378[M2]:C :1347 :56 Context: Despite his own optimism, Gage's convalescence was long, difficult, and uneven. Though recognizing his mother and uncle (summoned from Lebanon, New Hampshire, 30 miles away)[H]:12[M]:30 on the morning after the accident, on the second day he \\"lost control of his mind, and became decidedly delirious\\". By the fourth day, he was again \\"rational ... knows his friends\\", and after a week's further improvement Harlow entertained, for the first time, the thought \\"that it was possible for Gage to recover ... This improvement, however, was of short duration.\\" Beginning 12 days after the accident,[M]:53 Gage was semi-comatose, \\"seldom speaking unless spoken to, and then answering only in monosyllables\\", and on the 13th day Harlow noted, \\"Failing strength ... coma deepened; the globe of the left eye became more protuberant, with [\\"fungus\\"--deteriorated, infected tissue][M]:61,283 pushing out rapidly from the internal canthus [as well as] from the wounded brain, and coming out at the top of the head.\\" By the 14th day, \\"The exhalations from the mouth and head [are] horribly fetid. Comatose, but will answer in monosyllables if aroused. Will not take nourishment unless strongly urged. The friends and attendants are in hourly expectancy of his death, and have his coffin and clothes in readiness.\\" Galvanized, Harlow \\"cut off the fungi which were sprouting out from the top of the brain and filling the opening, and made free application of caustic [i.e. crystalline silver nitrate][M]:54[H1]:392 to them. With a scalpel I laid open the [frontalis muscle, from the exit wound to the top of the nose][H1]:392 and immediately there were discharged eight ounces [250 ml] of ill-conditioned pus, with blood, and excessively fetid.\\" (\\"Gage was lucky to encounter Dr. Harlow when he did\\", wrote Barker. \\"Few doctors in 1848 would have had the experience with cerebral abscess with which Harlow left [Jefferson Medical College] and which probably saved Gage's life.\\" [B]:679-80 See SS Factors favoring Gage's survival, below.) On the 24th day, Gage \\"succeeded in raising himself up, and took one step to his chair\\". One month later, he was walking \\"up and down stairs, and about the house, into the piazza\\", and while Harlow was absent for a week Gage was \\"in the street every day except Sunday\\", his desire to return to his family in New Hampshire being \\"uncontrollable by his friends ... he went without an overcoat and with thin boots; got wet feet and a chill\\". He soon developed a fever, but by mid-November he was \\"feeling better in every respect ... walking about the house again\\". Harlow's prognosis at this point: Gage \\"appears to be in a way of recovering, if he can be controlled\\". Question: Did he fully recover?. Whats the answer?","response":"Phineas Gage did not fully recover to his pre-accident state, as the accident and resulting brain damage significantly affected his personality and behavior. Although he survived the initial trauma and his physical condition improved over time, allowing him to walk and talk, the changes in his personality were profound and long-lasting. Before the accident, Gage was described as responsible, hardworking, and well-liked by his peers. However, after the accident, he became impulsive, irritable, and irresponsible - so much so that friends and acquaintances claimed he was \\"no longer Gage.\\" These changes made it difficult for him to maintain employment or social relationships and severely impacted the quality of his life. The case of Phineas Gage was groundbreaking for the field of neuroscience, as it demonstrated the crucial role of the brain's frontal lobe in determining personality, decision-making, and social behavior. Moreover, it showed that damage to specific parts of the brain could result in distinct personality changes, indicating that these abilities and traits are not diffusely distributed throughout the brain but have localized neural bases. To summarize, while Gage made considerable progress in his physical recovery and regained some functional abilities, he did not fully recover in terms of his personality and behavior. These lasting changes in his character highlight the significant impact of the brain damage he sustained in the accident."},{"question":"Context: Austin didn't feel like his tutor was very effective, so he saw another student tutor.

Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the claim, which states that the foundation of all American country music stems from the Dub music genre. Step 2: Research and identify the origins of American country music. American country music has its roots in various regional musical styles, including Appalachian folk music, traditional ballads, blues, and gospel. It emerged in the early 20th century in the Southern United States. Step 3: Research and identify the origins of the Dub music genre. Dub music is a subgenre of reggae music that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. It is characterized by the remixing and manipulation of existing recordings, with a focus on instrumental elements and heavy use of effects. Step 4: Compare the origins and characteristics of both American country music and Dub music. As we can see, American country music has roots in Southern United States and is influenced by a variety of regional styles, while Dub music is a subgenre of reggae that originated in Jamaica. Step 5: Determine if the claim is true based on the information. Given that the two genres have different origins and characteristics, it is unlikely that the foundation of all American country music stems from the Dub music genre.

If the answer is '5'; explain the reasoning:","response":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Tobias needs to spend 95 on a new pair of shoes. 2. He receives a 5 allowance a month for three months. This means 5 x 3 = 15 from allowances. 3. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways, which generate income as well. He mowed 4 lawns, earning 15 each. This means he made 15 x 4 = 60 from mowing lawns. 4. We still need to find out how many driveways he shoveled; let's call this number 'x'. He earns 7 for shoveling each driveway. So his total earnings from driveways are 7x. 5. After buying the shoes, he has 15 left over. This means that his total earnings before buying the shoes would be 95 (cost of shoes) + 15 (change) = 110. 6. Now let's bring everything together: 15 (allowance) + 60 (lawns) + 7x (driveways) = 110 (total earnings). 7. We can simplify the equation: 7x = 110 - 15 - 60 which results in 7x = 35. 8. Finally, to find out how many driveways he shoveled, we can divide both sides by 7: x = 35 / 7, which gives us x = 5. So, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways. The reasoning behind this number is based on analyzing the problem and solving the equation we formed, which showed us how many driveways he shoveled to have a total of 110 in earnings before buying the shoes."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Here is a hypothesis: Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that Mr. Whittington forcefully brought his fist down upon the desk, producing a bang. This action can be interpreted as him performing a rapid movement with his fist to strike the desk, creating a loud noise as a result. The hypothesis posits that Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. If we accept the premise as true, it logically follows that the hypothesis is true as well. This is because the premise directly demonstrates Mr. Whittington's ability to bang on the desk with his fist – an action that served as the key component for the resulting sound. In this scenario, the premise serves as evidence supporting the hypothesis. When we analyze the provided premise and assume it to be true, it becomes clear that Mr. Whittington did indeed use his fist to bang on the desk, thereby validating the hypothesis. To further elaborate, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their core components: 1. Premise: Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang. a. Mr. Whittington performed an action (bringing his fist down). b. He did this upon a desk. c. This action resulted in a loud noise (a bang). 2. Hypothesis: Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. a. Mr. Whittington possessed the ability (was able) to perform an action. b. The action involved using his fist. c. The intended result of the action was to bang on the desk. When comparing the core components of both the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe the following: - The subjects (Mr. Whittington) and the core actions (using his fist to bang on the desk) align in both statements. - The premise demonstrates Mr. Whittington's ability to perform the action by providing a specific instance (bringing his fist down upon the desk with a bang). - The intended result of the action (a bang) further validates the assertion in the hypothesis that Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, because the premise effectively substantiates the claim made in the hypothesis through direct demonstration of the action and its intended result."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: city, cloud, fog What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"A city is a big place where lots of people live, and in the sky, there are fluffy clouds that sometimes turn into fog, making it a bit hard to see around in the city."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: He really has worked not only very hard, but also in a very open, intelligent and approachable way.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in healthy eating habits, particularly with regards to plant-based diets. Proponents argue that such diets offer various health benefits, including reduced risks of heart disease, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Schools are one of the main avenues where children and adolescents develop their eating habits, and as such, there is a possibility that introducing a plant-based diet in schools could lead to the improvement of their overall health and well-being. Hypothesis: Implementing a plant-based diet in schools will have a significant positive impact on the health and well-being of students, leading to reduced risks of diseases associated with poor diet and offering long-term benefits. To explore this hypothesis in detail, the following aspects can be considered: 1. Evaluating the current dietary patterns in schools and identifying the prevalence of unhealthy food choices and their potential consequences. 2. Analyzing the nutritional composition of a plant-based diet and its potential benefits in addressing the dietary deficits observed in the existing school diets. 3. Identifying the potential challenges in implementing a plant-based diet in schools, such as feasibility, cost, and students' receptiveness to dietary changes. 4. Reviewing case studies of schools that have already adopted plant-based diets and evaluating the observed health and behavioural effects on students. 5. Assessing the long-term benefits of introducing a plant-based diet in childhood and adolescence in terms of reduced risk factors for chronic diseases and overall improvement in life expectancy. 6. Developing well-rounded strategies to incorporate plant-based diets in schools, including the establishment of nutritional guidelines, exploring various meal plans and recipe ideas suitable for different age groups, and evaluating the sustainability of such initiatives. 7. Assessing the importance of educational programs aimed at promoting awareness of the health benefits and ethical aspects of plant-based diets among students, parents, and school staff to encourage successful adoption and adherence to such dietary changes. By conducting thorough research and analysis on each of these aspects, it would be possible to form a clearer understanding of the potential benefits and challenges associated with introducing a plant-based diet in schools. If the hypothesis proves to be correct, there exists a strong case for schools to adopt plant-based diets as a strategy to improve the health of their students and contribute to the establishment of lifelong healthy eating habits."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas... The answer is:","response":"Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge, and Yellow toadflax are the non-native plant species considered noxious in the Shoshone National Forest.

These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family.

Can you tell me what it is?","response":"The passage provided contains information about the Blitz and its impact on Britain during World War II but does not explicitly answer the question of who took more overall casualties from bombings. It does, however, draw a comparison between the Blitz and the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany. From the passage, we learn that the British war industries continued to operate and expand despite the bombings, and that the Blitz itself resulted in relatively fewer casualties compared to later bombing campaigns in the war. The passage mentions that the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 alone inflicted around 42,000 civilian deaths, which is equivalent to the entire number of casualties during the Blitz. To determine which side of the conflict took more overall casualties from bombings, we would need additional information and data on casualties caused by bombings throughout the entire course of the war on both British and German sides. From the information provided, we can infer that the bombing campaign against Germany had a larger number of casualties in specific instances, such as the bombing of Hamburg in 1943.

These are the incredible birds eye view photos of Iceland’s extreme landscape - taken from up to 9,000ft in the air. The stunning shots were captured by husband and wife duo Erlend Haarberg, 46, and Orsolya Haarberg, 35, as they soared above the beautiful Nordic nation. The pair scaled mountains, trekked over some of the world’s most rugged terrain and took to the skies in a light aircraft to snap some of the world’s most spectacular scenery. Incredible: The hot spring in Iceland's Fjallabak Nature Reserve which is part of a series of pictures taken from up to 9,000ft in the air. And the beautiful results reveal the drastically contrasting landscapes of Iceland - from explosive volcanoes to Europe’s largest icecap. In one photograph, a fork of sideways lightening sparks out from the Eyjafjallajvkull volcano - which caused travel chaos when it erupted in 2010 - as it explodes into action. Another shot appears to show a tree, but is actually a river delta running into several different streams. Orsolya, from Jakobsli in Norway, who wed. Erlend in 2005 before embarking on the epic photography project, said:. 'Normally I get sick when flying, so I was thankful for the calm. conditions, otherwise I would have been in trouble.

'But it was definitely worth being patient. Iceland’s landscape is so extreme and varied - it makes for such amazing viewing. The colours of the flat landscape really only become visible once you are in the air.'

Erlend used an open window to capture clear shots of the world below as the plane banked to the left, allowing him to look straight down. Incredibly, thanks to the poor weather, they covered the whole nation in just one five-hour flight before being forced to return as the fuel ran low. Professional snapper Orsolya, who quit her studies to become a full-time photographer, added: 'It was a tight schedule. One minute we were photographing the erupting Eyjafjallajokull volcano and the next we were over Europe’s largest ice cap, the Vatnajvkull.

Context: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. Question: After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably: Options: - still new - In need of renovations - An historical landmark - not enough information Answer:","response":"An historical landmark"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who is unique in secretions?\\" is in \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","response":"The unique aspect of secretions in birds is their primary method of nitrogenous waste excretion. Unlike mammals, which excrete waste in the form of urea or ammonia, birds are primarily uricotelic. This means that their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid through the ureters into the intestine. This uric acid is then expelled along with feces as a semisolid waste, since birds do not have a urinary bladder or an external urethral opening. However, it is important to note that some birds, such as hummingbirds, can be facultatively ammonotelic, meaning they can excrete most of their nitrogenous waste as ammonia when needed. Additionally, birds excrete creatine instead of creatinine, which is typical in mammals. Another unique feature of birds' secretions is their digestive system. Birds have a crop for storing food and a gizzard containing swallowed stones that help with grinding food, compensating for their lack of teeth. This adaptation allows them to digest food rapidly, which is essential for flight.

Now let's examine the given options and determine which of these is the best fit for committee A: (A) V and U: This option includes two individuals who are not L. Since L is the only individual sewing on committee B, there is no constraint that prevents V and U from being in committee A. (B) V and T: Similar to option A, this option includes two individuals who are not L. There is no constraint that prevents V and T from being in committee A. (C) U and S: This option also includes two individuals who are not L. No constraint prevents U and S from being in committee A. (D) M and N: This option consists of two individuals, neither of which is L. No constraint prevents M and N from being in committee A. (E) T and U: Like the previous options, this option includes two individuals who are not L. No constraint prevents T and U from being in committee A. Since we have no additional constraints or information to differentiate between options, all of these options (A, B, C, D, and E) could potentially be the pair of individuals that serve on committee A."},{"question":"- Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment.

Randy is always late for the first period while Joseph is always on time as Select from: [-] Randy is a night owl.. [-] Joseph is a night owl..","response":"Randy is always late for the first period, while Joseph is always on time. The reason for their contrasting punctuality lies in their sleep habits. Randy is a night owl, meaning he tends to stay up late at night, resulting in difficulty waking up early in the morning. This negatively impacts Randy's ability to arrive on time for the first period at school. As Randy's body clock is naturally inclined towards late-night hours, his productivity and alertness do not peak until later in the day. Consequently, it is challenging for him to establish a routine that aligns with early morning school hours. Despite knowing the importance of punctuality, Randy struggles to break free from his night owl tendencies. On the other hand, Joseph is not a night owl. He maintains a consistent sleep schedule, focusing on getting a sufficient amount of rest daily. This enables Joseph to wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day ahead. Joseph's alignment with a healthy sleep pattern allows him to easily adapt to early morning commitments, such as arriving on time for the first period at school. In contrast to Randy, Joseph's peak productivity and alertness occur earlier in the day, making him better suited to adhering to a traditional school schedule. In conclusion, Randy's night owl tendencies contribute to his chronic tardiness for the first period, while Joseph's more balanced sleep habits enable him to consistently arrive on time. It demonstrates the significant impact that sleep patterns have on an individual's ability to function effectively in society, particularly when it comes to punctuality."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: What is a privilege to being an adult?
