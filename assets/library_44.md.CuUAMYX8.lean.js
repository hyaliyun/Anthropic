However, the specific sentence refers negatively to Angelina Jolie's (assumedly her character's) hairstyle in the movie (evidenced by the use of the word 'hideous' and the colloquial '\`do' standing for hairdo). This indicates a negative view towards at least one aspect of the movie.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: who encourages Yul ? Movie title: Cool Runnings Movie plot: In the beginning we see Derice Bannock (Leon) running across the island of Jamaica. Derice is training for the 1988 Olympic Games, and hopes to be a gold-medal winner just like his father.Before the trial run, Derice visits his friend Sanka Coffee (Doug E. Doug), who is competing in a pushcart race. Sanka wins the race but ends up crashing just after he crosses the finish line, to everyone's amusement.Later that day, Sanka joins Derice's family at the track for the Olympic trials. Derice is preparing to race, meeting a few other competitors, including a short athlete named Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis). The race starts off great, but halfway across the track, Junior stumbles and trips several runners, including Derice. Derice stumbles back to his feet as the finish-line tape is broken, watching his dreams go up in smoke.Derice confronts Coolidge (Winston Stona), who is charge of the Jamaican competition, and begs for a chance to run again, but Coolidge refuses. Derice then notices a photo of his father on his wall, next to an unfamiliar man. Coolidge identifies the man as Irving Blitzer, an American now living on the island and who had tried to convince Derice's father, Ben, to compete in bobsledding. Derice, seeing another chance to compete, as a bobsledder, takes the picture and goes to meet with Irv.Sanka hears about Derice's idea. At first he is excited but balks upon learning that bobsledding is a WINTER sport. Eventually Sanka is persuaded to help his best friend. The two men find Blitzer (John Candy) working as a bookie in a run-down pool hall. Having been disqualified from bobsledding due to cheating, and therefore disgraced, Blitzer is far from eager to help them, and does not want anything to do with the sport of bobsledding. However, the two athletes don't give up. Upon learning that Derice is the son of his old friend and colleague, Blitzer relents.Next day, Blitzer tries to recruit additional team members. The first newcomer is a bald man Sanka recognizes from the Olympic running trials, who... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Cool Runnings,\\" Yul Brenner (played by Malik Yoba) is one of the characters who encourages and supports other team members, especially Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis). Yul's background is as a tough and determined athlete who dreams of getting off the island and making a better life for himself. However, he has a strong sense of camaraderie and is willing to help those around him to achieve their dreams as well. At the beginning of the story, Yul is not part of the bobsledding team but later joins as one of the four members. His athletic background and determination make him a suitable candidate for the sport, even though he, like others on the team, has no prior experience with bobsledding. Yul is often seen pushing Junior to overcome his self-doubt, as well as his lack of confidence in his abilities. He encourages Junior to stand up for himself and to believe in the team's collective potential to succeed. In one memorable scene, Yul and Junior have a heart-to-heart conversation in their hotel room during the Winter Olympics. Yul tells Junior that he needs to see himself as a champion, regardless of what others think, and to take control of his own destiny. This pep talk helps to inspire Junior to overcome his fears and perform his best during the competition. Aside from Yul's encouragement, Junior also receives guidance and support from the team's coach, Irving Blitzer (John Candy). Blitzer, who is a disgraced former bobsledder, initially shows reluctance in helping the team but eventually sees their potential and becomes a supportive mentor. His knowledge of the sport and experience as a former Olympian prove invaluable to the team, as he helps them understand the nuances of bobsledding and helps them improve their skills. In summary, Yul Brenner plays a significant role in encouraging and supporting Junior Bevil throughout the movie \\"Cool Runnings.\\" Yul's tough yet compassionate personality helps to motivate Junior and other teammates to push themselves and realize their potential as bobsledders. Meanwhile, Irving Blitzer acts as a mentor to the team, providing them with the necessary tools they need to compete at the Olympic level."},{"question":"I can use this background: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers.

In 1863, around the time that playwrights like Henrik Ibsen were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the German playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote Die Technik des Dramas, a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid. Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dénouement/resolution/revelation/catastrophe. pick from the following. 1). no; 2). yes; Is this statement correct \\"is the denouement the same as the resolution\\"?","response":"To accurately answer the question, I will review the terms and their definitions: Denouement: The denouement is the final resolution or clarification of a narrative or dramatic plot. It generally occurs after the climax, when conflicts are resolved, and all loose ends are tied up. Resolution: The resolution is the point in a narrative or drama when the main conflict or problem is addressed or solved. It often occurs near the end of the story, after the climax. Now, I'll analyze if the statement \\"is the denouement the same as the resolution?\\" is correct. While the denouement and resolution both involve the conclusion of a narrative or dramatic plot, they are not exactly the same. The denouement refers to the overall resolution and clarification of the plot, whereas the resolution specifically focuses on the solution of the main conflict or problem. These concepts are closely related and often occur around the same time in a story, but they address different aspects of the ending. In terms of their functions within a story, they can be considered as different (but related) parts of the story. Given this analysis, the statement \\"is the denouement the same as the resolution?\\" can be considered as 1) no, since they are not exactly the same but are closely related concepts."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text. Steven handed over the written exam to Adam, because OPTIONS: [1]. Steven wanted to grade the driving test.. [2]. Adam wanted to grade the driving test..","response":"Steven handed over the written exam to Adam, because Adam wanted to grade the driving test. Adam, a veteran driving instructor and examiner, had recently taken over the responsibilities of overseeing the driving tests at the local testing center. He was keenly aware of the importance of both the written and practical aspects of the exam, as they were essential in ensuring that new drivers were proficient and safe on the roads. Taking the written exam from Steven with a warm smile and a nod, Adam walked back to his office, excited about the opportunity to help a new batch of aspiring drivers. He believed that by personally grading the exams, he would develop a better understanding of the students' grasp on traffic rules and defensive driving measures, which would enable him to give valuable feedback and guide them towards improvement. As Adam settled into his comfortable swivel chair, he began reviewing the first question, which focused on the right-of-way rules at a four-way stop. He appreciated the fact that the test covered a range of relevant topics, such as road signs, speed limits, alcohol and drug-impaired driving, and parking regulations. This comprehensive approach, he believed, was a crucial factor in creating well-rounded, responsible drivers who were confident behind the wheel. Adam mentally applauded Steven's commitment toward providing students with the necessary tools and resources to excel in their driving test. He knew that Steven had gone the extra mile in gathering the most up-to-date information on driving practices, incorporating it into the learning materials, and meticulously preparing the written exam. As he continued grading the exams, Adam was impressed by the students' overall knowledge and their ability to apply critical thinking when faced with challenging questions that required them to draw on their understanding of various driving scenarios. At the same time, Adam took note of the areas where improvement was needed, such as merging onto a highway, the use of turn signals, and the importance of maintaining a safe following distance. Adam also appreciated the variety of questions in the written exam, ranging from multiple-choice to short answer, and even a few diagram-based questions. This mix allowed him to gauge students' understanding from different angles, ensuring that they possessed a well-rounded grasp of the course material. Once he had finished grading all of the written exams, Adam carefully tallied the scores and recorded them in the database. He then began preparing detailed feedback and recommendations for each student, ensuring they would have a clear understanding of where they had excelled and what areas they needed to focus on. With the written exams completed, Adam refocused his attention on the practical driving tests. He knew that the process of becoming a skilled driver was an ongoing journey, and it was crucial to recognize and cultivate students' strengths while addressing their weaknesses. Working alongside Steven, Adam was determined to uphold the highest standards of driver education and ensure that the driving test process was both rigorous and effective, ultimately contributing to the safety and well-being of all road users."},{"question":"Botany Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress. Q: How did Darwin change the grouping pioneered by Linnaeus?","response":"Imagine you have a big box of toys and you want to organize them. Linnaeus, a scientist long ago, started organizing living things (like plants) in groups based on how they looked. He put plants that looked similar together, just like you would put all your toy cars together in one box. Later, another scientist named Darwin discovered that living things change over time, and that these changes happen because they have common \\"parents\\" or ancestors. Think about how all your toy cars have wheels and can roll on the floor because they were made to do the same thing. Darwin changed how we group living things, like plants, by looking at their shared history or family tree instead of just how they look. This is like grouping your toys based on who made them or what they are used for, rather than just their color or shape. Now, scientists use Darwin's ideas to better understand how living things are related and share a common history."},{"question":"Claim: \\"Works by the Brothers Grimm were originally written in German.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?

My point, of course, is not to suggest that reality-show contestants can’t have worthwhile views on matters of international affairs. Rather, what’s striking here is the Republican Party – which once considered credibility on foreign matter a matter of GOP birthright – is taking on a former Secretary of State in this presidential election, and the party lacks the kind of credible, experienced, high-profile professionals who can assess Clinton’s record on foreign policy in a serious way. To be sure, such figures exist in the party – there are several living former Secretaries of State from Republican administrations, for example – but they generally want nothing to do with promoting Trump’s candidacy, and they’re keeping political activities this year at arm’s length.

And the answer is...","response":"Step 1: Combine the like terms on the left side of the equation. The equation is -335x - 333x + 7225 - 27265 = 0. Combining the x terms, we get: (-335 - 333) * x = -668 * x. Combining the constant terms, we get: (7225 - 27265) = -20040. Now, the equation becomes: -668x - 20040 = 0. Step 2: Rearrange the equation to isolate 'x' term. Adding 20040 to both sides of the equation, we get: -668x = 20040. Step 3: Solve for 'x'. To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by -668. x = 20040 / (-668) = -29.9401 (approximately).

Will the label tell you anything you should know? Here's some general advice: Vintage. This is the first thing we look for ourselves. You don't need to care whether 2001 or 2002 was a better year in the Sierra Foothills. The vast majority of wines at the store are meant to be drunk right away, so you make sure the wine isn't too old, particularly if you're buying it expecting lively, fresh fruitiness. We often see five-year-old Pinot Grigio and two-year-old Beaujolais Nouveau at stores, for example, so as soon as we see that kind of age on wines like those, we know we can skip them and move on(and possibly not shop there again). Alcohol content. Too many wines have too much alcohol, which leaves them unbalanced. Sure, there are some classic wines with high alcohol levels, but many of today's regular table wines--Merlot, Chardonnay--have levels at 15% or above. Some of those might be terrific, but if we had nothing else to go on, we'd look for alcohol content at about 14% and below. The more specific the better. A wine that says it's from Napa is probably a better bet than a wine that simply says it's from California. Unfortunately, this will also probably be reflected in the price, so this might not tell you much about value, If you care enough to know a few of famous vineyards for producing high-quality grapes, they might help you make an educated guess about quality. Old vines. Theoretically, older vines produce fewer, but more flavorful grapes, but the problem is that no one has defined what an \\"old vine\\" is, so anyone can put this on the label. Just ignore it. A phone number. You'd be surprised many small-production wines these days include a phone number on the back and an invitation to call the winerY, which is a sign of a highly personal winerY. We have called those numbers many times over the years and it's amazing how often the winemaker or winerY owner answers the phone. Question: It's better to buy Yes or no, is the answer \\"the wine from famous vineyards\\"? Answer:","response":"Yes, it is generally better to buy wine from famous vineyards as they have a reputation for producing high-quality grapes, which can help you make an educated guess about the quality of the wine.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver.

In light of this , anything that limits procreation , be it the use of contraception or even condoning the use of contraception , is against God . 5. Catholics consider the first commandment given to them by God to be to \` multiply ' . What claim can be made from these sentences?","response":"From these sentences, the claim can be made that the Catholic Church firmly believes in adhering to the principles laid out in the Bible, specifically concerning procreation, and is therefore justified in taking actions that align with these beliefs, even if they might be perceived as harmful to its followers. This claim is derived from the fact that the first commandment given by God in the Book of Genesis, as mentioned in sentence 5, emphasizes the importance of procreation by commanding the followers to \\"multiply.\\" This belief is deeply intertwined with the teachings and core values of the Catholic Church, as they prioritize their obligations to God over the needs of the people (sentence 3). Consequently, they may engage in actions that uphold these commandments, even if they are against widely accepted practices such as contraception (sentence 4). The Church's justification for such actions stems from the belief that going against the wishes of God would be more detrimental to its adherents than short-term harm caused by the given stance (sentence 2). Thus, the Catholic Church has a strong conviction in upholding beliefs and commandments that, as per their interpretation, adhere to divine instructions. In conclusion, the claim that can be made is that the Catholic Church believes in strictly following the divine commandments concerning procreation and justifies taking actions to preserve these beliefs, even when it involves opposing commonly accepted practices like contraception or causing potential harm to its followers. Their primary focus remains on fulfilling their duty towards God and maintaining the sanctity of the Church's core principles as outlined in the Bible."},{"question":"(AFP - 28/12/06; AP, Reuters, Spiegel Online - 27/12/06; AFP, DPA, Deutsche Welle, International Herald tribune, EUobserver, RFE/RL - 19/12/06) Translate this to English?","response":"This text is already in English and refers to various sources (news agencies and online news publications) that published news on the given dates (28/12/06 and 19/12/06).

A series of tectonic events in the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods caused different paleogeographic regions. The Alps are subdivided by different lithology (rock composition) and nappe structure according to the orogenic events that affected them. The geological subdivision differentiates the Western, Eastern Alps and Southern Alps: the Helveticum in the north, the Penninicum and Austroalpine system in the center and, south of the Periadriatic Seam, the Southern Alpine system.

Vodka, known for its subtle taste and versatility, is a widely popular choice in cocktail recipes as it pairs well with a variety of flavors without overwhelming them. Originating in Eastern Europe, vodka has evolved into one of the most commonly consumed spirits in the world, with variations in flavor and quality depending on the region and production methods. To better understand the significance of vodka in the screwdriver cocktail, let us delve into the origins of the drink and its history, the recipe and preparation, variations, and the role vodka plays in making this classic cocktail what it is today. The origins of the screwdriver cocktail date back to the mid-20th century, though its exact birthplace and creator remain subjects of debate. According to one legend, American oil workers based in the Persian Gulf during the 1940s would discreetly mix vodka and orange juice in their cups, stirring the concoction with their screwdrivers. This improvised mixing tool gave the cocktail its name. Alternatively, other sources suggest that the screwdriver might have originated in the United States as a simple and convenient way to enjoy vodka. The screwdriver cocktail is known for its simplicity, making it a popular drink among home bartenders and professional mixologists alike. The basic recipe consists of just two main ingredients: vodka and orange juice. To prepare a classic screwdriver, fill a highball glass with ice, pour in 1.5 to 2 ounces of vodka (depending on desired strength), and top with approximately 4 ounces of orange juice. Stir the contents gently, then garnish with an orange wedge or twist if so desired. Variations of the screwdriver cocktail have emerged over time, featuring additional ingredients or substitutions to suit different tastes and preferences. Some popular screwdriver adaptations include the 'Harvey Wallbanger,' which incorporates Galliano L'Autentico, an Italian herbal liqueur, and the 'Sloe Screw,' which swaps the vodka for sloe gin. In each case, vodka's unassuming flavor profile allows the spotlight to shine on the other ingredients, thus contributing to the versatility and appeal of the screwdriver cocktail. In conclusion, vodka is the essential spirit drink at the heart of a screwdriver cocktail. Its nearly neutral taste merges seamlessly with the refreshing sweetness of orange juice, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of occasions, from casual gatherings to more sophisticated events. The simplicity and adaptability of the screwdriver recipe have contributed to the cocktail's enduring popularity, with vodka remaining an indispensable component of this timeless classic."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

As he sifted through the items on his desk, he tried to retrace his steps to remember where he might have last seen the elusive key. He began to rummage through his drawers, organizing the items methodically as he searched. His eyes flicked from one object to the next, and he meticulously pushed aside paper clips, rubber bands, and a tangle of pens and pencils. A crumpled receipt caught his attention for a moment, but he quickly dismissed it, realizing that the date on it was too old to be relevant to his current predicament. Deciding to change tactics, the man turned to examine the stack of books and papers that cluttered his desk. He carefully arranged them into neat piles, hoping that the key would reveal itself in the mess of paperwork. Disappointed by the lack of results, he pushed back his chair, stood up, and surveyed the room for any other possible hiding places. His gaze wandered to a small cabinet near his desk. It had an assortment of things he didn't use often, but he figured it was worth a shot. Slowly, he opened the door and carefully shifted through the objects inside - an old watch with a worn leather band, a collection of coins from past travels, and a dusty, half-finished novel. Alas, the key was still nowhere to be found. Feeling frustrated, the man decided to retrace his steps throughout his home. He went back to the living room and began to search the cushions and crevices of his comfortable sofa, asking himself why he hadn't secured the key in a proper place. He knew keeping it on the key rack would have prevented this entire ordeal, but it was too late for regrets now. With a sigh, he moved on to the kitchen, examining every countertop and drawer, even checking behind the refrigerator and the trash can. Once again, he was met with disappointment. The search continued through the bathroom and bedroom, each room turning up no trace of the lost key. Feeling weary but still determined, he retraced his steps back to his office, falling onto the chair and staring at the items he had strewn across the desk in his search. He was starting to feel resigned to the notion that he would never find his lost key when something caught his eye - a hint of metal gleaming in the sunlight that filtered through the blinds. As if by some miracle, the man noticed an unclasped binder carelessly lying on the edge of his desk. The shiny piece of metal nestled between the pages appeared to be the lost key he'd been seeking. Excitedly, he pulled it from the confines of the binder, relief washing over him as he finally held the missing object in his hands. All the frustration and anxiety of his lengthy search fell away, replaced with an overwhelming sense of satisfaction. He meticulously returned the room to its original state and carefully placed the key on the key rack, vowing never to make the same mistake again.

And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. \\"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,\\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much.

The correct answer is Tony Trapani after thinking Childress was his because Tony Trapani is the 81-year-old man who found the letter about Samuel Childress. He thought Childress was his son, but the paternity test turned out to be negative. The other options are wrong because: - Childress, Donna Childress, and Samuel Childress are other people involved in the story, but Tony Trapani is the one who found the letter and thought Childress was his son. - Grand Rapids and Michigan refer to places, not people. - Trapani is just another way to refer to Tony Trapani, but his full name is more appropriate in this context."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which Supreme Court case in the 1940s was related to the protest that the participants of the Civil Rights Movement at The Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama participated in? Answer:","response":"The Supreme Court case in the 1940s related to the protest that participants of the Civil Rights Movement at The Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama were involved in was Morgan v. Virginia (1946). This case centered around interstate bus transportation and racial segregation. In Morgan v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation on interstate buses was unconstitutional, as it violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. This decision was an essential precursor to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, ultimately leading to protests like the Freedom Rides, which specifically targeted segregation in bus terminals and transportation facilities. The Freedom Rides began in 1961 when civil rights activists boarded interstate buses and traveled throughout the South to challenge the discriminatory policies that persisted in spite of the Morgan v. Virginia ruling. Activists encountered violence and resistance, most notably at the Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama, where they were attacked by a mob of white supremacists. The Freedom Riders and their protests played a crucial role in amplifying the need for stronger enforcement of civil rights in the United States. Their actions eventually led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, both of which significantly diminished institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in the country."},{"question":"Q:This is a picture of a classroom.

It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How can a computer be attacked?","response":"A computer can be attacked in various ways. Attackers, often referred to as hackers, exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system to gain unauthorized access, corrupt data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious activities. Below are some of the common methods through which a computer can be attacked: 1. **Malware Attacks:** These are among the most common types of attack. Malware is software that is designed to cause damage to a computer system. Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can be introduced to a system via email attachments, software downloads, operating system vulnerabilities, among others. 2. **Phishing Attacks:** In phishing attacks, attackers attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. This is usually done through email spoofing or instant messaging and it often directs users to enter their personal details at a fake website that looks and feels almost identical to the legitimate one. 3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** These occur when attackers insert themselves in the communication between two parties to eavesdrop, steal data or tamper with it. These attacks can happen in any form of online communication, like email or a web browser session. 4. **Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** In these attacks, attackers overwhelm the victim's network, computer, or service with traffic or requests. This causes the system to slow down significantly or even crash, making it impossible for users to access it. 5. **Zero-Day Exploit:** Zero-day attacks occur during the vulnerability window that exists in the time between when a software vulnerability is discovered and when a patch to fix the vulnerability has been developed and deployed. During this time, hackers can exploit the vulnerability to create significant damage. 6. **SQL Injection:** In an SQL injection attack, an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's database query software to gain unauthorized access to information in the database. 7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This type of attack happens when an attacker injects malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts can bypass access controls and can be used to compromise the user's data and privacy. 8. **Password Attack:** There are several types of password attacks, including brute-force, dictionary attacks, keyloggers, and credential reuse attacks. In any case, the attacker's goal is to gain unauthorized access by cracking the user's password. These different types of attacks highlight the need for robust computer security measures, including up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, secure network configurations, regular software updates, and the use of strong, unique passwords. Moreover, user education on identifying potential security threats like phishing attempts is also paramount to maintaining computer security."},{"question":"Acesta a anunţat de asemenea că va da în judecată reţeaua locală Sitel TV, care difuzează diverse afirmaţii despre Crvenkovski – inclusiv faptul că acesta îi plătea pe experţii sloveni încă din 1996.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","response":"One possible question that could be asked from this paragraph is: \\"How did al Qaeda manage to fulfill the requirements needed to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation, such as funding, personnel recruitment, training, communication, and intelligence gathering, during the planning stages of the 9/11 attack?\\""},{"question":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Solve this problem.","response":"To solve the equation -3*m - 8*m = 22 for m, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms Since both -3*m and -8*m have the same variable (m), we can add the coefficients together. -3*m - 8*m = -11*m So, the simplified equation becomes: -11*m = 22 Step 2: Isolate the variable (m) Now, we need to isolate the variable m by getting it on one side of the equation by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of m, which is -11.

Fact 2: Mammals have hair and fur. Given the two facts above, why do some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter? The answer is:","response":"To understand why some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter, let's break down the given facts and connect them logically. Step 1: Analyzing Fact 1 Fact 1 says that some animals' fur grows thicker for staying warm in the winter. This suggests that there is a relationship between the thickness of the fur and the ability to stay warm in cold weather. Step 2: Analyzing Fact 2 Fact 2 informs us that mammals have hair and fur. This implies that the animals referred to in Fact 1 are mammals since they have fur. Step 3: Connecting the facts Now, we can connect these two facts to understand why some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter. Since mammals have fur, and the purpose of this fur is to keep the animal warm, it would make sense for the fur to grow thicker in colder conditions, such as winter. Thicker fur provides better insulation, which helps to retain body heat and protect the animal against the cold. Step 4: Formulate the answer Given the logical connection between these two facts, the answer is: Some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter because the increased thickness of their fur provides better insulation, helping them stay warm in cold weather."},{"question":"Q: Tracy met Taylor's parents at the park and they had a nice long chat.

Queen Victoria, born in 1819, was the longest-reigning British monarch, having occupied the throne from 1837 until her death in 1901. Her reign, known as the Victorian era, significantly impacted British society and culture in various ways, including politics, science, technology, and the arts. Additionally, her influence extended beyond the confines of the British Empire, reaching nations and societies across the globe. At the beginning of Victoria's reign, Britain was already an established global power, known for its vast empire and industrial advances. The queen's rule saw the expansion of the British Empire to its largest extent, encapsulating territories such as India, Australia, Canada, and Africa. As a constitutional monarch, Queen Victoria was involved in the process of appointing prime ministers but played a more symbolic role in the day-to-day affairs of state. Queen Victoria's reign was marked by the emergence and solidification of British parliamentary democracy. Key pieces of legislation were introduced during this time, including the Reform Act of 1867, which expanded the electorate, and the 1872 Ballot Act, which introduced secret ballots. These reforms laid the groundwork for a more inclusive and representative democratic system. The Victorian era was a period of rapid industrial, scientific, and technological growth. The industrial revolution, which had begun earlier in Britain, gained further momentum during this time. Innovations in transportation and communication, such as the invention of the railway and the telegraph, helped to connect people and expand trade networks both domestically and internationally. These advances also led to increased urbanization, as people moved to cities for opportunities in manufacturing and commerce. In terms of culture and the arts, the Victorian era saw the emergence of several important literary figures, including Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, Charlotte Bronte, and Lewis Carroll. Their works often explored themes of social justice, morality, and the human condition, providing commentary on the events and challenges of their time. Victoria also had a deep appreciation for music and the visual arts, and her patronage of various artists helped to cultivate a rich artistic environment. Beyond the British Empire, Queen Victoria's reign had social and cultural implications on a global scale. Her reign coincided with the rise of European imperialism, and her influence was felt in countries as far as Asia and Africa through the growing reach of the British Empire and the spread of British values and culture. The queen became a symbol of British power and of the broader ideals of the time, promoting constitutional monarchy, stability, moral values, and national pride. Additionally, the Victorian era saw the emergence of a global economy through the expansion of international trade and the development of new industries, such as rubber and textiles. These global connections fostered the exchange of ideas and aided in the dissemination of British cultural influence to other countries. The queen herself was a symbol of British superiority and, as such, her image and ideas surrounding her reign were often used to promote British dominance in far-reaching territories. In conclusion, Queen Victoria's reign was a defining period for British society and culture, marked by significant advancements in politics, science, technology, and the arts. The influences of her reign extended beyond the British Empire, shaping the trajectory of global development and spreading British values and culture throughout various regions of the world. Her legacy as a powerful and influential monarch firmly places Queen Victoria in history as an integral figure in shaping modern Britain and the broader world."},{"question":"Q: What causes the temperature to decrease?

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits In 2006 Neil Finn asked Nick Seymour to play bass on his third solo album. Seymour agreed and the two joined up with producer and multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns to begin recording. As the recording sessions progressed it was decided that the album would be issued under the Crowded House band name, rather than as a Neil Finn solo album. In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20 days of auditions, former Beck drummer Matt Sherrod joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up. As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer Steve Lillywhite including the album's first single \\"Don't Stop Now\\". On 17 March 2007 the band played a live show at their rehearsal studio in front of around fifty fans, friends and family. The performance was streamed live as a webcast. The two-and-a-half-hour set included some new tracks, including \\"Silent House\\" co-written by Finn with the Dixie Chicks. A concert onboard The Thekla, moored in Bristol, followed on 19 March. Crowded House played at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on 26 April as a warm-up for their appearance at the Coachella Festival on 29 April in Indio, California. They also played at the Australian Live Earth concert in Sydney on 7 July. The next day, Finn and Seymour were interviewed on Rove Live and the band, with Hart and Sherrod, performed \\"Don't Stop Now\\" to promote the new album, which was titled Time on Earth. The single was a minor hit in Australia and the UK. The album was released worldwide in June and July. It topped the album chart in New Zealand and made number 2 in Australia and number 3 in the UK. On 6 December 2008 Crowded House played the Homebake festival in Sydney, with warm up gigs at small venues in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. For these shows the band were augmented by multi-instrumentalist Don McGlashan and Neil's younger son, Elroy Finn, on guitar.

The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the elder and the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is the younger sister, a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Ironically, Gish was actually 15 years older than Davis. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with. Tisha (Sothern) is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters' conversations and revelations.

The company said that it won a license to hold auctions in Shanghai beginning this fall. Christie's and other auction houses have been reaping big profits from twice-yearly sales in Hong Kong, a former British colony that's now a special administrative region of China. Wealthy mainland Chinese collectors are a regular fixture at the sales and their purchases of art, jewelry, wine and other collectables have helped turn the city into one of the world's biggest auction centers. But the foreign auction houses are eager to break into the mainland Chinese market so they can better target buyers. CEO Steven Murphy said in a statement that the license means Christie's will be \\"able to directly conduct auctions in China under its own brand, and will offer collectors a more direct access to our global network and expertise,\\". \\"Now Christie's will be able to engage with our clients in Shanghai in the same way that we have done over many years in London, Paris, New York and Hong Kong,\\" he added. Christie's announcement outdoes its rival Sotheby's, which last year set up a Chinese joint venture with local state-owned company Beijing GeHua Art Co. Chinese auction houses have also stepped up the battle for the Asian art market by expanding out of the mainland. Beijing Poly International and China Guardian, the country's two biggest auction houses, held sales in Hong Kong for the first time last fall, going head-to-head with Christie's, Sotheby's and smaller houses from around the world. China became the world's biggest art market in 2011 but slipped back behind the United States to second place last year with total sales of 10.6 billion euros (13.8 billion) as the economy cooled, according to an annual report by The European Annual Fine Art Foundation. ____ Online: http://www.christies.com/ ||||| Last year Sotheby’s formed a joint venture in Beijing with the state-owned Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group to hold auctions in China. Sotheby’s is the 80 percent owner of that enterprise. Now Christie’s has signed its own agreement with the City of Shanghai and plans to hold its first auction this fall, although the company said the agreement restricted it from dealing in “cultural relics.” The company can operate throughout China but will be based in Shanghai and pay taxes there. In a statement Steven P.

Options: - can produce - harvestation - water plants - produce food - rise early Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"A convenient way for a farmer to preserve their crops would be to can produce, as this method allows for long-term storage while maintaining the quality and nutritional value of the crops. Reasoning: 1. Canning produce: Canning involves preserving food in airtight containers, typically glass jars, enabling long-term storage at room temperature. This method helps maintain the quality, taste, and nutritional value of the harvested crops. It allows farmers to store surplus crops and make them available for consumption at a later stage without the need for refrigeration. Thus, canning provides an effective way to preserve their produce and prevent wastage. 2. Harvestation: This term relates to harvesting, which is the process of gathering mature crops from the fields. Harvesting is an essential step in obtaining and using crops but does not directly involve preserving the harvested crops. 3. Water plants: Watering plants is a routine task required to maintain and grow crops and is not a method of preserving them. It ensures the plants are provided with appropriate moisture levels during their growth cycle. 4. Produce food: Producing food refers to growing and cultivating crops or raising livestock to generate food products. Although producing food is fundamental to farming, it is not a technique for preserving harvested crops. 5. Rise early: This option indicates the act of waking up and starting work early in the day. While being an early riser can help with managing farm tasks efficiently, it does not directly contribute to preserving crops after they have been harvested. In conclusion, the most convenient way for a farmer to preserve their crops among the options provided is by canning produce, as it allows long-term storage without compromising nutritional value or quality."},{"question":"Translate to German: The Comfort Inn Manhattan is close to all interesting sightseeings in New York.","response":"Das Comfort Inn Manhattan liegt in der Nähe aller interessanten Sehenswürdigkeiten in New York.

Downward dog for back pain, sun salutations for an energy boost - yoga has become the workout for a healthy mind and body, and is the exercise of choice for endless celebrities including Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. But is the ancient art form as healthy as we’d like to think? On yesterday’s Today programme on Radio 4, New York Times science writer William Broad, the author of a controversial new book, The Science Of Yoga: The Risks And Rewards, asked whether yoga - when taught incorrectly - might actually have the potential to kill. Bent out of shape: New York Times science writer William Broad yesterday asked whether yoga - when taught incorrectly - might actually have the potential to kill. During his research Broad - who himself practised yoga for many years before getting injured doing it in 2007 - uncovered endless documented examples of injuries to backs and limbs such as strains, broken bones and trapped sciatic nerves. He also found to his ‘horror’ that while some poses were low risk others could have extremely serious consequences. These risks, he says, occur as a result of hyper-extension - over-stretching - of the head and neck. It’s not just doing advanced postures such as headstands, where you balance your legs straight up in the air, resting on just your head and hands, that are risky, says Broad. He’s gathered evidence that even traditional yoga moves, or asanas, practised at beginner and intermediate level, can lead to serious problems. ‘This is not anecdotal and they are not freak accidents,’ he says. ‘Postures like the shoulder stand, in which you lie on your back and raise your legs into the air, and the plough, in which you lie on your back and put your feet over your head on the floor behind you, that are widely performed can crank the neck around in a risky way.’ Reductions of blood flow in one of the vertebral arteries, called the basilar artery, are known to cause strokes in some people and can be fatal. ‘If the clots that form go to the brain, you can have a stroke,’ Broad says. ‘And one in 20 people who have these vertebral artery problems can die.’ He explains that the first real evidence of yoga injuries was initially published in credible medical journals several decades ago. As long ago as 1972, a respected Oxford University neurologist, Professor Ritchie Russell, wrote an article in the British Medical Journal arguing that some yoga postures had the potential to cause strokes in healthy, young people. He had found evidence that yoga students typically turned their necks as far as 90 degrees, double what is considered a normal, healthy rotation. Such excessive extension of the head and neck, Russell said, could harm the fragile arteries running along the neck, causing clots, swelling and constriction. In theory, he said this could produce serious problems in the brain. Followers: Brad Pitt and his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston both partake in yoga as their exercise of choice. In 1973, a spinal rehabilitation expert at Cornell University Medical College described the case of a 28-year-old woman who suffered a stroke while doing a yoga move known as the wheel or upward bow in which a person lies on their back and then lifts their body into an arc, balancing on the hands and feet in a sort of back-bend. Instead of allowing the head to hang in this position, many people tense and move their necks in an attempt to create balance, a move which can dangerously backfire. A few years later another paper, this time in the Archives of Neurology Journal, detailed the case of a 25-year-old man who was rushed to hospital with loss of control in the left side of his body and blurred vision. Again, yoga was to blame. The patient had been performing daily. asanas every morning, including spinal twists in which participants lie. or sit on the floor and twist their upper body in the opposite direction. to their lower body to stretch the spine, as well as shoulder stands,. often maintaining the positions for five minutes. Doctors wrote that a series of bruises down his lower neck were a result of trauma ‘caused by repeated contact with the hard floor surface on which he did his yoga exercises’. Examinations revealed he had suffered a stroke after his left vertebral artery became blocked, preventing blood from reaching his brain. While he recovered the ability to walk, his hand function remained damaged. Over the years, Broad says that there is an increasing amount of ‘real data that medical and government communications have gathered’ confirming yoga’s risks. In 2001, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published an article citing yoga as one of the many possible causes for arterial damage in susceptible patients. Broad also cites a 2009 survey of US yoga therapists, teachers and doctors that looked at the most common yoga-related injuries. The researchers from Columbia University found that while back injuries were, predictably, the most usual, the next most common in declining order of prevalence were shoulder injuries, knee problems, neck injuries and then strokes. ‘The respondents noted four cases in which yoga’s extreme bending and contortions resulted in some degree of brain damage,’ Broad writes. ‘The numbers weren’t alarming, but the acknowledgement of risk pointed to a decided shift in the perception of the dangers yoga posed.’ So common are yoga-related injuries that they are even being recognised in medical dictionaries. Dangerous? In 2001, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article citing yoga as a possible cause for arterial damage in susceptible patients. Broad highlights the case of a young man who was relatively experienced at yoga and spent several hours a day in a kneeling position known as vajrasana - something that is not advised for long lengths of time. After a few weeks, he had difficulty walking or climbing stairs and went to see his doctor for an explanation. He was told that the kneeling posture had prevented oxygen from reaching a branch of the sciatic nerve that runs from the lower spine through the buttocks and legs. As a result, the nerve had become temporarily deadened and, after seeing several other cases of the same injury, doctors named the condition ‘yoga foot drop’. Glenn Black, a yoga teacher for nearly 40 years, who spoke to Broad when he was doing his research, says he has seen everything from pinched nerves, lower back tightness and injuries to hips and knees - and worse - among yoga regulars. He says moves such as the chaturanga - a challenging pose similar to the plank in which all four limbs and the core abdominal muscles support the body - can create repetitive use injuries in the shoulder. He adds that moves with deep knee flexion. such as deep squats, which are a feature of many standard yoga. postures, can strain ligaments and tendons. Lifting the head - instead of letting it hang - during arm balances, in which you support the entire body with the hands on the floor, can also restrict blood flow to the brain and around the body, Black says. Any asanas involving flexing, extending and rotating the lower back and cervical spine can cause problems. ‘It’s a myth that it’s safe to do an asana without awareness and consciousness,’ Black says. Indeed he has come to believe that ‘the vast majority of people’ should give up yoga altogether. Furthermore, he is convinced that people are ending up in hospital because they have underlying physical problems that make serious injury more likely. Instead of doing yoga, they should be doing specific exercises to strengthen these weaker parts of their bodies. But is Broad being alarmist? In the UK, the growth in the number of people taking part in yoga - it is now thought to be close to one million - has predictably led to a growth in related injuries, according to the Society of Sports Therapists, but there are no reported cases of anyone suffering a stroke as a result of yoga exercises. Defenders claim its links to injury and pain can mostly be caused by poor teaching. Yoga is woefully unregulated in the UK and anyone can become an instructor after completing a weekend course. Pierre Bibby, chief executive of the British Wheel of Yoga, the national governing body says: ‘Yoga is not bad for you, but bad teaching is.’ The BWA’s own instructors undergo a minimum of two to four years’ tuition. Others blame the fact that yoga has become too competitive. ‘People push themselves too far,’ says Mollie McClelland, a yoga teacher at the Alchemy Centre in London. ‘And there are such huge egos in yoga that everyone wants to prove a point.’ Broad agrees that yoga does have benefits. It can relieve stress and decrease pain, but it can be a disappointment for those expecting it to bring miraculous changes to body and mind. It was while doing the extended-side-angle pose, a posture hailed as a cure for many diseases, that Broad’s own back ‘gave way’ five years ago. ‘With it,’ he says, ‘went my belief, naïve in retrospect, that yoga was a source of only healing, never harm.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"This article discusses the potential risks and dangers of practicing yoga, especially when taught incorrectly.

A: A:","response":"The substances that function as a long-term energy store in the human body and possess long carbon chains that prevent dissolving in water are lipids, specifically triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of lipid composed of a glycerol molecule bound to three fatty acid chains. These fatty acid chains are long hydrocarbon chains, which make triglycerides nonpolar and hydrophobic, meaning they do not dissolve in water. Lipids, including triglycerides, act as energy reservoirs in the human body. They provide energy when needed but can also be stored in adipose tissue for later use. One gram of triglycerides provides about nine calories of energy, making them an efficient long-term energy storage molecule. Additionally, lipid storage helps insulate and protect internal organs and plays a role in various biological functions such as cell membrane structure, hormone synthesis, and cell signaling."},{"question":"The Croatian People's Party (HNS), meanwhile, has called on the government to resign because four cabinet members are on HFP's advisory board.

Sentiment analysis refers to the process of identifying and categorizing the emotion expressed in a piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral. The given sentence is quite minimal, without much context, making it a bit challenging to definitively assign a sentiment. However, let's examine the possible meanings and their corresponding sentiments: 1. Positive sentiment: In this scenario, we can interpret the sentence \\"to which it succeeds\\" as praising a movie or some aspect of a film. The word \\"succeeds\\" generally has a positive connotation, as it implies that something has accomplished its goal or met the desired standard. In this case, one can argue that the sentiment expressed is positive, as it acknowledges the success of the movie. 2. Neutral sentiment: Another interpretation is that the sentence might be part of a larger context where it is not explicitly offering praise or criticism but simply acknowledging that the movie has successfully met its objective. In this case, you can view the sentiment as neutral, as it neither expresses a strong positive nor negative emotion. Given the ambiguity of the sentence, it is crucial to consider the context in which it appears in a movie review to provide an accurate sentiment analysis. Understanding the surrounding sentences and the overall tone of the review would help narrow down whether the sentiment is positive or neutral."},{"question":"Lizzy: Judy uses 10 pencils during her 5 day school week.

I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To determine the cost of pencils for Judy over 45 days, follow these steps: 1. Determine the total number of pencils she uses during the 45 days. 2. Determine the packs of pencils she needs. 3. Calculate the cost. Step 1: Determine the total number of pencils used during the 45 days. - Judy uses 10 pencils during her 5-day school week, so her daily usage is 10 pencils / 5 days = 2 pencils per day. - For 45 days, she would use 2 pencils per day * 45 days = 90 pencils. Step 2: Determine the packs of pencils she needs. - A 30 pack of pencils costs 4. - To get the necessary 90 pencils, Judy would need to buy 90 pencils / 30 pencils per pack = 3 packs of pencils. Step 3: Calculate the cost. - Each pack costs 4, and Judy needs 3 packs. - Therefore, the total cost would be 3 packs * 4 per pack = 12.

The answer is:","response":"Title: The Lurking Shadows Genre: Psychological Thriller/Mystery Plot: Act 1: Setup Dr. Jeremy Renfield, a brilliant yet reclusive scientist, is convicted of a series of grisly murders of fellow scientists. He is sent to the high-security Graymoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane, where the most dangerous minds are kept. Despite maintaining his innocence, no one believes him. At Graymoor, Renfield is assigned to a cell adjacent to Victor Rowan, an enigmatic inmate and former illusionist with a dark past. The two men form an uneasy bond over their shared conviction that they've been wrongly imprisoned. Victor, intrigued by Renfield's case, finds his illusions and expertise in escapology useful in getting information about the other inmates and staff. Renfield, on the other hand, starts putting together a plan for an impossible escape from the cell that he believes will clear his name. Act 2: Confrontation After weeks of planning, Renfield confides in Victor about his escape plan. He has discovered an underground network of tunnels beneath the asylum, constructed during the Cold War as a fallout shelter. He believes he can access these tunnels through a hidden entrance in his cell, and then navigate through them using his acute sense of direction. He believes that once he is free, he can gather evidence to exonerate himself. Victor, meanwhile, has become increasingly fascinated with the \\"Lurking Shadows\\", mysterious figures in dark shrouds he claims to have seen roaming the corridors of the asylum. He also shares his belief that these beings are behind the murders that landed them both in Graymoor. Together, Renfield and Victor put their plan into motion, managing to break through the hidden entrance in Renfield's cell and enter the subterranean tunnels. They navigate through the dark maze, encountering forgotten relics of the past along with mounting evidence of the true culprits behind the murders. However, as they delve deeper into the labyrinth, they also start to unveil the disturbing truth about the Lurking Shadows. Act 3: Resolution Renfield and Victor realize that the Lurking Shadows are not supernatural beings, but a secret organization operating within the asylum. They are an elite group of medical doctors, scientists, and businessmen, conducting unethical experiments on the inmates in order to advance their own careers and influence. It is then revealed that Renfield was framed because his research on human consciousness threatened to expose their activities. Dr. Gregory Lamarck, the head psychiatrist at the asylum and secret leader of the organization, is desperate to capture the two escapees before they make their way out of the tunnels. The thrilling climax of the story follows Renfield and Victor as they outwit and evade the Lurking Shadows and the corrupt staff of Graymoor. Ultimately, Renfield and Victor manage to contact the outside world and bring down the organization, uncovering the truth about their innocence in the process. Dr. Lamarck and the rest of the Lurking Shadows members are arrested for their horrendous crimes. The movie ends on a bittersweet note, as Renfield is exonerated and released from Graymoor, while Victor is left to complete his sentence for his real past misdeeds. The two exchange an emotional farewell, acknowledging the bond they formed through their shared struggle against an invisible enemy. As Renfield walks away from the asylum, he resolves to start a new chapter in his life, dedicated to advocating justice for the wrongfully accused and standing up against corruption within the system."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A brown dog is running into the ocean as it chases a purple frisbee.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A dog is doing a backflip.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

Should there be a right be to be stupid? Do we have the right to be stupid?","response":"While the two questions may appear similar at first glance, they are not exactly the same. They both explore the concept of having the right to be stupid, but they approach the topic from slightly different angles. Let's examine these questions in more detail: 1. Should there be a right to be stupid? This question is more philosophical in nature and looks at whether or not society should accept and allow an individual to exercise stupidity. It involves a normative evaluation, requiring us to form an opinion on whether it is desirable or morally sound to grant such a right. In this scenario, one may argue that the right to be stupid is grounded in the principle of personal freedom. People should have autonomy over their thoughts, beliefs, and actions, even if they may occasionally lead to self-inflicted harm or less-than-ideal outcomes. This perspective is often based on the idea that personal growth and self-discovery can only be achieved through trial and error and by learning from one's mistakes. Additionally, one could argue that excessive regulation of individual behavior may stifle creativity and innovation, leading to a more controlled and less vibrant society. On the other hand, some may argue that granting a right to be stupid might lead to detrimental consequences for society as a whole. For instance, if people act without considering the consequences, it could result in dangerous situations or negatively affect the well-being of others. In this case, opponents of the right to be stupid may advocate for a more cautious and responsible approach to individual freedom, emphasizing the importance of balancing personal autonomy with collective interests. 2. Do we have the right to be stupid? This question shifts the focus from whether or not a right to be stupid should exist to whether it currently exists. It typically looks at the legal and social frameworks in place and assesses whether there are protections or allowances for individuals to act in ways that might be considered \\"stupid.\\" In democracies, legal systems often prioritize personal liberty, allowing individuals the freedom to think, believe, and act as they choose, within certain limitations. While there may not be a specific \\"right to be stupid\\" written into law, people might still be afforded the freedom to make misguided or irrational decisions so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others. This would mean that, in practice, there is a level of tolerance for individual folly, although that would be restricted by laws and regulations designed to maintain public order and safety. However, different societies might have different tolerances for perceived stupidity. In some cultures, conformity and adherence to societal norms may be highly valued, leaving little room for behaviors or actions that deviate from the expected. In this case, there might exist social pressures that discourage acting in ways that are perceived as \\"stupid,\\" even if there is no specific legal framework addressing such behaviors. In conclusion, while both questions deal with the concept of having the right to be stupid, they are not exactly the same. The first question focuses on whether or not society should accept and allow an individual the right to be stupid, which requires a normative evaluation. Conversely, the second question assesses whether an individual currently has the right to be stupid based on existing legal and social frameworks. Both questions prompt valuable discussions on the balance between personal freedom, responsibility, and the interests of society as a whole."},{"question":"Premise: \\"One man looks into the distance next to another who has his hand in the air.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Two men are looking at the same thing.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño.

Says the teen years are turbulent for girls - and parents. Says be a good role model, help her deal with peer pressure, accept she will have mood swings. Advises mothers to avoid fad diets and don't pressure girls to lose weight. Says parents who 'hide' their body tell daughters they should be 'ashamed' of their own. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Dr. Helen Wright's Guide to Navigating the Turbulent Teenage Years for Girls and Their Parents Introduction: Raising a teenage girl can be a challenging journey, filled with emotional highs and lows. It's a crucial period for both parents and their daughters as they navigate the complexities of growth and self-discovery. Dr. Helen Wright, an expert in child development and family dynamics, has recently published a guidebook aimed at helping parents better understand and support their teenage daughters. In this article, we will discuss the key takeaways from Dr. Wright's advice on fostering a healthy and supportive environment for teenage girls. 1. Be a Good Role Model for Your Daughter: One of the most important things a parent can do for their teenage daughter is to be a positive role model. This includes demonstrating healthy behaviors, such as respectful communication, emotional intelligence, and responsible decision-making. By embodying these qualities, parents encourage their daughters to also adopt these traits, which will benefit them throughout their lives. 2. Help Her Deal with Peer Pressure: Peer pressure is an inevitable part of adolescence, and it can be a significant challenge for teenage girls. Parents should be aware of the possible negative influences their daughters may face and actively support and guide them to make good decisions. Providing an open and non-judgmental environment for communication, asking about their friends and social activities, and actively listening to their concerns are all crucial steps in helping girls resist peer pressure. 3. Accept That Mood Swings are Normal: The teenage years are marked by hormonal changes and emotional turbulence. Dr. Wright emphasizes that parents should accept and be prepared for mood swings as a natural part of their daughter's development. Instead of dismissing them, offering support and empathy during challenging times will help strengthen the parent-daughter bond. 4. Avoid Fad Diets and Encourage a Healthy Relationship with Food: Many teenage girls may feel pressured to conform to societal ideals of beauty, which may lead to unhealthy eating habits and body image issues. Dr. Wright advises mothers to avoid fad diets and instead promote a healthy, balanced approach to food. By modeling positive eating habits and focusing on overall health rather than appearance, parents can help their daughters develop a healthy relationship with their bodies and food. 5. Don't \\"Hide\\" Your Body or Promote Body Shame: Lastly, Dr. Wright emphasizes the importance of transparency and openly embracing one's body, regardless of its shape and size. Parents who \\"hide\\" their bodies inadvertently send a message to their daughters that they should be ashamed of their own. By embracing and maintaining a positive body image, parents can encourage their daughters to also accept and love themselves just as they are. Conclusion: Navigating the teenage years with a daughter is a rewarding, yet challenging experience for both parties. Dr. Helen Wright's guidebook offers parents invaluable advice to help them better understand and support their growing girls. By implementing these strategies, parents can help create a supportive and nurturing environment that will empower their teenage daughters to develop into confident, self-assured young women."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

Born in Vladivostok, Russia, Brynner later moved to the United States and pursued a career in acting. In Westworld, Brynner's character is a relentless, black-clad android known as The Gunslinger. The film is set in an amusement park called Delos that features three themed areas: Westworld, Medieval World, and Roman World. Wealthy patrons who visit the park are entertained by lifelike androids, who cater to their every desire and enable them to live out their fantasies within the parks' immersive environments. In Westworld, guests can engage in mock gunfights with cowboy robots and indulge in the fictionalized Wild West atmosphere. Directed and written by Michael Crichton, Westworld explores the dangers of technology and artificial intelligence when the amusement park's androids malfunction and start attacking visitors. The Gunslinger, played by Brynner, becomes one of the primary antagonists of the film as he relentlessly pursues and attempts to kill the movie's main characters, Peter Martin (played by Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (played by James Brolin). Yul Brynner's performance in Westworld is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and influential depictions of a sentient robot in the history of cinema. His portrayal of The Gunslinger set the template for many subsequent humanoid robot and android characters in science fiction films. Moreover, Brynner's role in Westworld is particularly notable because it stands in stark contrast to his previous roles, such as his well-known portrayal of King Mongkut of Siam in the Broadway musical and the 1956 movie adaptation of The King and I, and his appearance in The Ten Commandments (1956) as Rameses II. In conclusion, Yul Brynner played the role of the gunslinging cowboy robot 406 – The Gunslinger – in the groundbreaking 1973 movie Westworld, making an indelible contribution to the history of both science fiction film and the depiction of robots in popular culture."},{"question":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Where did Omar misfire the rocket? The training camp The answer is:","response":"Step 1: Establish the main characters To build a movie plot, I will start by creating the main characters. In this case, our protagonist is Omar, a young and passionate individual who decides to join a secretive training camp in order to fight for what he believes in. Step 2: Create the setting The story takes place in a remote and covert training camp, hidden deep within a dense forest. The camp is run by seasoned veterans, who train new recruits in the art of guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and specialized weapons handling, such as rocket launchers. Step 3: Develop the conflict As Omar's training progresses, he struggles with mastering the rocket launcher. Despite his best efforts and the support of his fellow recruits, his performance continues to be subpar. One day, during a live-fire exercise, Omar misfires the rocket, causing a catastrophic accident that puts the entire camp and its members in danger. Step 4: Introduce a turning point The accident leads to Omar being ostracized by his fellow recruits and trainers, who doubt his commitment and ability to effectively contribute to their cause. However, instead of succumbing to despair and self-doubt, Omar becomes determined to redeem himself and prove his worth to the group. Step 5: Introduce external threats With Omar's accident and the subsequent explosion, the previously hidden training camp has drawn the attention of the government and rival factions. As external threats begin to close in on the camp, the group must decide whether they can trust a seemingly unreliable Omar with their lives and the success of their mission. Step 6: Bring the story to a climax As the enemies' forces approach, Omar takes it upon himself to devise a plan to defend and save the camp. With time running out, Omar must put his newly acquired skills to the test and confront his own fears and insecurities. In a dramatic showdown, Omar successfully fires the rocket launcher at a critical target, destroying the enemy's advance and proving his worth to the group. Step 7: Resolve the conflict With Omar's heroic actions, the group is able to repel the external threats and maintain the secrecy of their training camp. Omar earns the respect of his fellow recruits and trainers, and they continue on their mission, united and inspired by their shared experiences and newfound camaraderie. In summary, the answer to the question, \\"Build a movie plot around this: Where did Omar misfire the rocket? The training camp\\" involves following these steps: establishing characters and setting, creating conflict, introducing a turning point, developing external threats, climaxing with a heroic event, and resolving the conflict, resulting in a thrilling and emotional tale of personal redemption and camaraderie in the face of danger."},{"question":"Write a sentence that about [William Anders DATE_OF_BIRTH \\"1933-10-17\\"; William Anders ALMA_MATER \\"AFIT, M.S. 1962\\"].","response":"William Anders, who was born on October 17, 1933, went to a school called AFIT and finished studying there in 1962."},{"question":"Scrobipalpa nitentella the Common Sea Groundling is a moth of the Gelechiidae family.

They actually convey opposite information due to the positioning of 'wettest' and 'driest' in each sentence. 1. The first sentence states: \\"The wettest calendar year since 1948 has been 1965 and the driest 1956.\\" According to this sentence, 1965 is indicated as the wettest year, and 1956 is identified as the driest year. 2. The second sentence states: \\"The driest calendar year since 1948 has been in 1965 and the wettest in 1956.\\" In contrast to the first sentence, this one conveys that 1965 is the driest year, and 1956 is identified as the wettest year. The confusion seems to arise from the incorrect placement of the terms 'wettest' and 'driest' in the second sentence, which alters the intended meaning. To make both sentences convey the same information, you can rephrase the second sentence as follows: \\"The wettest calendar year since 1948 has been in 1956, and the driest in 1965.\\" Now both sentences convey the same information – 1965 is the wettest year, and 1956 is the driest year."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in Polish language and its corresponding English translation.

But after boarding her return flight Thursday she was told she needed to get off. Ash-har Quraishi reports. (Published Friday, Aug. 3, 2018) For DePaul music student Jingjing Hu, her cello — worth nearly 30,000 — is priceless. “Maybe I’m exaggerating, but it’s more than our life,\\" she told NBC 5 Friday. So, for her trip to Miami to perform in a music festival, she and her husband booked two seats: one for her and a second for her prized cello. Hu said she called American Airlines and verified with the agent that both her departing and returning flights would be able to accommodate the cello in a set. “When I flew from Chicago to Miami, I didn’t have any trouble with that,\\" she said. The flight crew gave her a special strap to hold the instrument in place. But after boarding her return flight Thursday she was told she needed to get off. “She said your cello is too big,\\" Hu recalled an America Airlines employee telling her. \\"This aircraft is too small to hold your cello.\\" Hu was cleared by security and American Airlines representative to board the plane on her return flight, and given the strap again even though it was a slightly smaller plane, she said. But after securing the instrument, it appeared the airline had changed its mind. Federal regulations allow musicians to carry oversized instruments like cellos in the cabin when passengers purchase an additional seat. American’s own policy makes this clear on their website: as long as the instrument doesn’t weigh more than 165 pounds and meets unspecified \\"seat size restrictions based on airplane type.\\" Hu’s weighs less than 10. Still, she says she was escorted off the plane by law enforcement. This isn’t the first time it’s happened. Last year an American Airlines passenger was booted from a flight because the airline said his cello--also in its own seat--posed a security risk. The airline later said that was an error and apologized. The airline said it rebooked Hu for another flight the next morning on a larger aircraft and provided her with hotel and meal accommodations. American Airlines told NBC 5 in a statement there was a \\"miscommunication\\" about whether the cello met the requirements to fit onboard the aircraft. \\"We apologize for the misunderstanding and customer relations will be reaching out to her,\\" the statement read. A tearful Hu finally made it back to Chicago Friday where her husband, Jay Tang, was waiting. “I don’t think we did anything wrong here and I think the way they handled it was humiliating,\\" Tang said. Hu says she hopes to get a sincere apology from the airline and hopes other musicians can learn from her experience. “You had so many chances to tell me 'you cannot board' yesterday,\\" she said. \\"You never told me until I sat down.\\" ||||| This is how American Airlines treats musicians! So my wife Jingjing Hu, a DePaul University School of Music student, is scheduled to fly back to Chicago on American Airlines flight 2457 from Miami today. She is travelling with her cello in a hard case as a cabin baggage. I purchased two round trip tickets for her and her cello on Apr.2 on the phone directly from AA and told them specifically that one ticket is for the cello as cabin baggage. I was told it is abosolutely allowed and she won't have any problem. She flew from Chicago to Miami on American Airlines 335 on Jun. 19 without any problem. She checked in her flight back yesterday online for both herself and the cello. Today she arrived at Miami International Airport - MIA 3 hours ahead, checked in her luggage, went through security check, and boarded the plane normally. Just before the flight attendants were about to close the gate, she was told to get off the plane because \\"the aircraft is too small for the cello\\". She was assured that she could get on the next flight to Chicago about 1 hour later. When she was turning around and leaving the plane, her cello case touched the pilot. The pilot immediately claimed that he was bleeding because of the touch, while apparently there is no blood or injury to be found. My wife then took a picture of him and he was doing the victory sign to her and said \\"this is why we need to get her out\\". Interestingly my wife was travelling with a friend, who remained on the plane. She told us that after my wife left, two other passengers came and sat in her and her cello's seats. The story does not end here. After she got off the plane and trying to find the next flight that was guaranteed, she was told that the next flight was also \\"too small\\" for the cello, and they called the police because my wife was \\"not being understandable\\". Fairly speaking no one can understand what's happening. So surrounded by three law enforcement officers, my wife was told again that either she purchase first or business class tickets out of her pocket or she could not fly back to Chicago on an American Airlines flight because of Federal Aviation Administration regulations. So basically you either have to be rich to purchase the tickets, or just settle in Miami. I don't know how are musicians supposed to travel to comply with those \\"regulations\\". But clearly AA is just playing around with customers. They just kick off passengers when they oversell their tickets using FAA regulations as an excuse. I could have been told those regulations when purchasing the ticket. My wife could have been told those regulations when flying from Chicago to Miami, at check in counter in Miami International Airport, at the gate or even when boarding the plane. Yet they chose to kick her out last minute after she was seated and her cello safely secured. They even need law enforcement involved. What a shame. Please share and forward this if you can. We are so helpless when facing those giant companies. We demand American Airlines to offer my wife and her cello a flight back to Chicago, an explanation and an apology. CBS Chicago ABC 7 Chicago WGN TV Fox 32 Chicago DePaul University help my wife please. I just want her back safe and sound. Please retweet this if you can as many of you tell me that they respond faster on twitter. https://twitter.com/Mr_JaYtanG/status/1025203805581918209 ****************** UPDATE ****************** I wrote the story when my wife was told that she either had to purchase two first or business class tickets to fly or she would never get on board. At the mean time I have made contact with news media about the ongoing story. Hours later, she was booked flight 2796 back to Chicago today, and given a room at Holiday Inn. The police officer escorted her to the shuttle bus. Once she arrived at the Holiday Inn, she was told that she was at the wrong Holiday Inn. So she had to wait for another shuttle to another Holiday Inn. I wonder how many Holiday Inns are around MIA. This morning, she was told she could only have breakfast for 12 or less, otherwise she had to pay by herself. At the gate, she was denied pre-board and boarded the airplane in Group 5. She felt very anxious, constantly asked me if she would be kicked off the plane again. The flight took off just now as scheduled and she is on the plane. Interestingly minutes after take-off, I received a DM from AA saying the cello cannot fit into a 737 is the reason that she was kicked off. A screenshot is posted. I’m hoping that I can pick her up at noon without further complications. Her luggage checked in yesterday was on the original flight. Not sure if they can keep that. Her music sheets are in that luggage and musicians know how important and value they are. ****************** UPDATE #2 ****************** My wife is back home! Her luggage that arrived yesterday at ORD on the original flight was already there at the baggage claim help desk. I am not sure if this is the normal service they provide or because of the incident. I am trying to be objective and only state facts. I got more replys from AA on twitter. They insisted on the size of the cello. I am waiting to see what their \\"specialist\\" can give us after the \\"deep dive\\". Another screenshot posted. Please forgive me typos. Thanks for everyone who shared this and supports us. She is exhausted but physically OK. Her well being is the only thing I care. ****************** UPDATE #3 ****************** The NBC 5 news is online.

They have only released a statement to NBC 5 and guaranteed me a deep dive. ||||| Chicago (CBS) — A Chicago musician traveling with her cello was removed from an American Airlines flight in Miami as she tried to return home. In a post on Facebook that has been shared more than 1,600 times, Jay Tang posted about his wife’s experience with American Airlines: “So my wife Jingjing Hu a DePaul University School of Music student, is scheduled to fly back to Chicago on American Airlines flight 2457 from Miami today She is traveling with her cello in a hard case as a cabin baggage. I purchased two round trip tickets for her and her cello on [April 2] on the phone directly from AA and told them specifically that one ticket is for the cello as cabin baggage. I was told it is [absolutely] allowed and she won’t have any problem.” “It was her first time traveling with the cello,” having its own seat Tang told CBS 2 about the trip. As immigrants from China aware of prior incidents with passengers on airplanes, Hu read articles about traveling with a musical instrument. “We read the news about how passengers are treated on American airlines. We just don’t want to get in any trouble,” Tang said. Hu had flown from Chicago to Miami days earlier without incident, her cello secured in the seat beside her. On the day of her flight home, Hu said she arrived at the gate and requested to pre-board. Hu told CBS 2, “When I asked them can I pre-board, they never told me no.” She pre-boarded, requested and received a seatbelt extender, and settled in for the trip. Hu said a flight attendant approached her before the airplane doors closed and told her she would have to leave the plane, as the aircraft was too small for the cello. After she deplaned, Hu asked to see the regulations for traveling with a cello. She said they handed her a printout indicating that “bass violins/fiddles” are not permitted on a 737. Hu said the cello is not a bass violin or fiddle. Beneath the rules about bass violins and fiddles, a section in the printout about the cello reads, “Cello must be assigned a bulkhead window seat on a non-exit row.” It goes on to state “This can be in any cabin.” There is also mention of “757 equipment.” Another passenger on the plane, Sandy Schadt said, “Flight attendants from first class came back and said she would have to deplane because the plane was too small for the cello.” Schadt said as she boarded she had not noticed the cello in the row ahead of her. After Hu was removed, Schadt says a man and a woman promptly sat in the seats previously occupied by Hu and the cello. “She was off and the next people were on,” said Schadt. After deplaning, Hu learned the next American Airlines plane to Chicago was the same size as the one she had been removed from. “When I get off the plane they said the next hour plane is not available because it’s the same size,” Hu said. American Airlines booked her on a larger plane, scheduled to leave the next day. Her experience with the hotel also proved to be problematic, according to Tang’s update: “Hours later, she was booked flight 2796 back to Chicago today, and given a room at Holiday Inn. The police officer escorted her to the shuttle bus. Once she arrived at the Holiday Inn, she was told that she was at the wrong Holiday Inn. So she had to wait for another shuttle to another Holiday Inn,” Tang posted. “I cried alone in the lobby,” Hu said. Hu spent the night in Miami. “She called me this morning and she was anxious about getting on the plane,” said Tang. Tang posted an updated upon his wife’s return to Chicago: “My wife is back home! Her luggage that arrived yesterday at ORD on the original flight was already there at the baggage claim help desk,” he wrote. “She is exhausted but physically OK. Her well being is the only thing I care [about].” Hu said she is not sure she will fly again with her cello. “Will they kick me off again? I’m so scared.” “I don’t think they handled it very well. We didn’t get any phone call from American Airlines,” Hu said. She said Tang has received messages from the company representatives on Twitter, letting him know they will take a “deep dive” into the situation. American Airlines released a statement blaming the incident on a “miscommunication.” “A passenger on flight 2457 from Miami to Chicago was traveling with her cello. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication about whether the cello she was traveling with met the requirements to fit onboard the particular aircraft she was flying, a Boeing 737,” spokeswoman Alexis Aran Coello stated in an email. “We rebooked our passenger on a flight the next morning on a larger aircraft, a Boeing 767. We provided her a hotel and meal accommodations for the inconvenience. We apologize for the misunderstanding and customer relations has reached out to her.” |||||Summary:","response":"A music student named Jingjing Hu was flying with her cello from Miami to Chicago. She and her husband had bought two plane tickets, one for her and one for her cello so it could sit next to her. This is because some instruments are delicate and expensive, so they need special care when traveling. When Jingjing was on the plane, a flight attendant told her the airplane was too small for her cello and she had to leave. This made her very upset and confused. Later, the airline realized there was a mistake and apologized to Jingjing, providing her with a hotel stay and a different flight the next day."},{"question":"I heard that Carson always had a fond opinion and admired their aunt. And I was wondering What will the others feel afterwards? Answer:","response":"The feelings and reactions of the others in the family or social circle may vary greatly, depending on the relationship they had with the aunt and Carson, individual temperaments, and the overall group dynamics. Here's an analysis of possible scenarios and reactions that individuals within the group may experience: 1. Shared Admiration: If the others in the group were also in agreement with Carson's fond opinion of the aunt, they may appreciate and respect Carson's views. They might take Carson's admiration as evidence of a genuine bond between the two and feel it strengthens their own connection to the aunt. Family members may share stories of the aunt's kindness, wisdom, and positivity, creating a warm atmosphere and sense of unity. 2. Disagreement: If some individuals in the group do not share Carson's admiration – perhaps due to personal disputes or differing viewpoints – there may be some tension and discord. These people might feel jealousy, resentment or annoyance at Carson's opinions of the aunt. They could become defensive and argue or debate the aunt's qualities, possibly leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere or a strained relationship between the disagreeing parties. 3. Curiosity: Some may be intrigued by Carson's close bond with their aunt and may want to learn more about the reasons behind the admiration. Even if they do not share the same opinion, they might appreciate Carson's feelings and choose to engage in discussions about the aunt's values and life principles. Such conversations can foster understanding and tolerance for diverse opinions and experiences within the group. 4. Indifference: There might be group members who won't be affected by Carson's admiration of the aunt as it does not pertain to their own experiences or concerns. They may choose to remain neutral or uninfluenced, engaging in other conversations unrelated to the aunt or Carson. Their reactions might be cordial or uninterested, focusing on other topics or relationships within the group. 5. Reflection: Witnessing Carson's admiration for the aunt may encourage others to reflect on their own relationships and values. They might reconsider their judgments or biases and open up to the possibility of seeing the aunt in a new light. This introspective process can lead to personal growth, fostering empathy and paving the way for improved relationships within the group. In summary, the emotional aftermath of Carson's admiration for their aunt will vary within the group, depending on individual perspectives, relationships, and group dynamics. Some may feel inspired by Carson's sentiments, while others may disagree, or even feel indifferent. The key in this situation is mutual respect and open communication to foster understanding and facilitate healthy discussions."},{"question":"Write a \\"(A).\\" movie review (Possible answers: (A). negative (B). positive).","response":"(A) Oh dear, this movie didn't make me happy, and I think you wouldn't like it either. The story was confusing, like trying to put together a puzzle with missing pieces. The characters were not very nice, and they didn't make us laugh or smile.

What is the sentiment of this tweet? Choices: [-] negative; [-] positive;...I think the answer is","response":"negative. The correct answer is \\"negative\\" because being tortured is a bad thing, and it makes the person unhappy or in pain. Even if it's with \\"the cream of ice\\" (which might mean ice cream), the word \\"tortured\\" makes the whole situation seem not fun and uncomfortable. So, the feeling in this tweet is sad or bad, and that's why the sentiment is negative. The other choice, \\"positive,\\" is wrong because positive means that the tweet makes someone feel happy, good, or excited. But this tweet talks about being tortured, which is not a positive or happy situation. So, it cannot be a positive sentiment."},{"question":"His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The American went to Europe by train.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The American went to Europe by airplane.\\" Reason slowly and give your answer.","response":"After analyzing the two sentences, I can conclude that Sentence A goes against common sense. Here's my step-by-step reasoning: 1. Both sentences discuss an American traveling to Europe. 2. Europe and America are two separate continents, separated by a large body of water, the Atlantic Ocean. 3. Modes of transportation in the sentences are train (Sentence A) and airplane (Sentence B). 4. Trains typically rely on connected rail systems and cannot travel over large bodies of water without bridges or tunnels. 5. Airplanes are capable of flying over the ocean and directly connecting different continents. 6. Currently, there is no existing train connection (bridge or tunnel) between America and Europe. Taking these factors into account, it goes against common sense for an American to travel to Europe by train (Sentence A). On the other hand, traveling by airplane (Sentence B) is a widely accepted and feasible mode of transportation between the two continents."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Here, apart from a few choice flashbacks, the action is crawlingly linear--and opaque.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The action jumps all over in a non linear fashion.\\" true?","response":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"The action jumps all over in a non-linear fashion.\\" appears to be not true. The premise states that the action in the discussed content is \\"crawlingly linear\\" and \\"opaque.\\" This implies that the progression of events is following a straight, sequential path, rather than jumping around in a disordered manner. To delve into the details, the premise can be broken down into three key aspects: 1. \\"Apart from a few choice flashbacks\\" - This suggests that there might be a few moments in the story where the narrative deviates from the linear progression temporarily, taking the audience back in time to past events. However, these instances are rare and specifically chosen, not a persistent focus throughout the piece. 2. \\"The action is crawlingly linear\\" - The term \\"crawlingly\\" may imply that the progression is slow or perhaps even tedious, but it is still linear, meaning that it follows a straight sequence of events. The use of \\"crawlingly\\" might emphasize the contrast between the limited non-linear instances (the flashbacks) and the overall linearity of the action. 3. \\"Opaque\\" - This word could refer to the storytelling method or the content itself. Opaque usually means difficult to understand or not transparent in terms of clarity. So, while the action may be linear, unfolding in a clear sequential manner, the overall plot or certain story aspects can still be challenging to comprehend, demonstrating that linearity does not necessarily equate to total clarity. In conclusion, the premise does not support the hypothesis that the action is non-linear. On the contrary, it emphasizes the linear nature of the story, with some rare instances of flashbacks only slightly deviating from the linearity. However, the story's opacity illustrates that, despite following a linear path, the plot or some aspects of the story might still be difficult to understand."},{"question":"Q:Shirg-e Aqa - Shirg-e Aqa (Persian: شيرگ اقا‎ also Romanized as Shīrg-e Āqā) is a village in Momenabad Rural District in the Central District of Sarbisheh County South Khorasan Province Iran.

Located off the northwest corner of Europe, the country includes the island of Great Britain – which contains England, Scotland and Wales – and the northern portion of the island of Ireland. The year 2017 ushered in anxiety about the country’s role on the global stage, due to the public voting in the summer of 2016 to leave the European Union. The vote raises questions about the European Union , as well as the policies supporting the eurozone . ||||| (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images) The mood on the international conference call at the beginning of this month was somber as Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, prepared to list off top global dangers in the coming year. Bremmer began with a show-stopping line: \\"If we had to pick one year for a big unexpected crisis — the geopolitical equivalent of the 2008 financial meltdown — it feels like 2018.\\" The reasons are many, Bremmer cited, but the most prominent causes for global insecurity stem from U.S. President Donald Trump's move away from global leadership, and China's eagerness to fill the perceived vacuum. Bremmer isn't alone. Donald Trump pledged to \\"Make America Great Again.\\" The world thinks he is doing the opposite. The United States slips in this year's U.S. News Best Countries ranking, dropping to the No. 8 spot after falling one position from its 2017 ranking. Switzerland, an island of stable prosperity in a world of turmoil, remains the Best Country, according to a global survey of more than 21,000 persons. The reasons for America's drop – the second straight year its ranking dipped – are fueled by the world's perceptions of the country becoming less progressive and trustworthy, more politically unstable and a president who after just a year in office is far more unpopular than any other head of state or company CEO. As in 2017, Canada remains the No. 2 in the survey. Germany, as it was in 2016, is perceived as the most powerful country in Europe – surpassing the U.K. to place at No. 3 overall, while the U.K. drops to No. 4. Japan rounds out the top five, the highest finish for a nation in Asia, a region which survey respondents increasingly believe holds many of the keys to the world's future. At No. 6 is Sweden and Australia moves up to the No. 7 position, surpassing the U.S. The 2018 Best Countries rankings, formed in partnership with global marketing communications company Y&R's brand strategy firm, BAV Group, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, are based on a study that surveyed global citizens from four regions to assess perceptions of 80 countries on 75 different metrics. Trump Shocks, Divides the World The Best Countries rankings come just days after Trump celebrates his first year as U.S. president. The U.S. is still seen as the most powerful nation. In many ways, however, the results reflect 12 months of ongoing signs of the decline of America's standing in the world. In this sense, a noticeable \\"Trump Effect\\" is taking hold of the U.S. Just days after taking office, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by pulling the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Weeks later a poll showed just 15 percent of Germans believed the new U.S. president to be competent. By last spring's NATO summit, European leaders had begun believing that the U.S. had abdicated its leadership role in the military alliance, as Trump shifted support for both NATO and the European Union. As summer unfolded, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Days later, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center released a poll showing the unpopularity of Trump and his policies was sharply dragging down global opinion of the U.S. Meanwhile, Trump's statements further rattled world opinion. The president engaged in a war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. By November, Trump had begun accumulating a sizeable trail of verbal gaffes to world leaders. By early January, the Washington, D.C.-based Freedom House warned that democracy was \\"in crisis\\" around the world, in no small part because of Trump's repeated attacks on the judiciary system and news media in the U.S., lack of seeking \\"meaningful input\\" from relevant agencies and \\"violations of basic ethical standards.\\" In the Best Countries survey, the greatest drop by the U.S. in the rankings came in the perceptions of survey respondents for countries having open travel policies. The backlash against Trump's travel ban order in February 2017 and subsequent media attention are having a lasting impact on America's image, and challenging long-held perceptions of the country's reputation for openness. One piece of good news for the U.S.: The country is seen as the No. 2 country overall for education. Even so, U.S. higher education industry experts worry the country is becoming a less attractive destination for international students, partly because of U.S. immigration policies. Opportunities for Many Countries Among other key findings in the 2018 Best Countries survey: America's perceived retreat from its traditional global leadership role is creating opportunities for other countries, particularly in the areas of \\"soft power,\\" arenas where economic and cultural influence drive opinions and policy-making. Switzerland's position as the No. 1 overall country is driven by its reputation for citizenship and being open for business. For the third year in a row, Canada is seen as offering the best quality of life, driven by high ratings for education, health care and public safety. In Asia, the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP hasn't slowed the advancing economic might of the region, particularly in China. Authorities in Beijing now see the U.S. foreign policy signals as mixed and an opportunity to work more closely with other countries, including American allies. \\"Trump's neo-isolationist and unilateralist inclinations have given China a golden opportunity to enhance its prestige, status, and international leadership,\\" says Zhang Baohui, a professor of political science and director of the Centre for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. The Best Countries survey findings on leadership and trust in governments and companies are particularly revealing. Approximately 82 percent of survey respondents believe there is a leadership crisis, and 61 percent say they trust private companies more than the government to take care of their needs. Additionally, corporate CEOs are more supported than government leaders. Only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have approval ratings to rival the top ratings by CEOs such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. And the people with the highest disapproval ratings? By far, Trump, followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. For 10 interesting facts on the Best Countries survey, click here.

Imagine you're a big kid in a playground with lots of other kids. Some kids are making cool things with play dough, and others are deciding the rules of the playground. Now, the United Kingdom (UK), where Big Ben and the Queen live, is a really big kid. The UK has many friends and is important in playground matters, telling others how things should be done. It's located away from the rest of the playground, like on a tree island. But a while ago, the UK decided to stop playing some games with a team called the European Union. This made other kids wonder about what will happen to the team without the UK. Each year, big kids from around the world compare how well they are doing in the playground. This year, the US, where Mr. Trump is the class monitor, went down in the list because some kids think it isn't playing nice anymore, and isn't a reliable friend. Switzerland, imagine it as a kid who always eats his vegetables and never gets into fights, keeps doing very well. Canada, where moose and maple syrup come from, is doing great too. Kids' opinions matter a lot in this playground. The way other kids see you can change how well you do in these annual comparisons. So right now, not all kids are happy with the US and its class monitor, Mr. Trump. This is because Mr. Trump decided to stop playing a trading game with some kids named Trans-Pacific Partnership. He also said some not-so-nice things and did not want to play the climate change game. Now the good news for America is it's really good in the 'education' game, like a bright kid who often gets A's. But some smart children from around the world might not want to learn from America because of some rules Mr. Trump has. All this is resulting in a big shuffle in the playground. Some new kids get a chance to be noticed and liked. Switzerland, the always well-behaved kid, is the coolest, and Canada has the best life, like always having the yummiest lunchbox. Also, the kids at the playground believe that the folks who run toy companies could probably do a better job running the games on the playground than the class monitors. Only Canada's class monitor Mr. Trudeau and Germany's monitor Mrs. Merkel are as cool as the toy company bosses. And sadly, class monitors Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin are not so liked.

The banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal the assassin's name. Bond escapes with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped, and Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters back in London. Bond gives chase to the assistant/assassin on a boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome, where she attempts to escape via hot air balloon. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses, then causes the balloon to explode, killing herself. Bond traces the recovered money to Viktor \\"Renard\\" Zokas, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain.

Household uses for soaps include washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping, where soaps act as surfactants, emulsifying oils to enable them to be carried away by water. In industry they are also used in textile spinning and are important components of some lubricants. - A sulfonate is a salt or ester of a sulfonic acid. It contains the functional group R-SO. - A carboxylate is a salt or ester of a carboxylic acid. \\"Carboxylate salts\\" have the general formula M(RCOO), where M is a metal and \\"n\\" is 1, 2...; \\"carboxylate esters\\" have the general formula RCOOR. R and R are organic groups; R H. - Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. - Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube). - Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with \\"soft water\\"). Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone and chalk which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates. - A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with \\"cleaning properties in dilute solutions.\\" These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water. - Linear alkylbenzene is a family of organic compounds with the formula C6H5CnH2n +1 . Typically , n lies between 10 and 16 , although generally supplied as a tighter cut , such as C12 - C15 , C12 - C13 and C10 - C13 , for detergent use . The CnH2n +1 chain is unbranched . They are sometimes called LABs . They are mainly produced as intermediate in the production of surfactants , for use in detergent . Since the 1960s , LABs have emerged as the dominant precursor of biodegradable detergents . What entity does 'linear alkylbenzene' has the relation 'has part' with?

He couldn't wait to go outside and play in the snow with his friends. He put on his warmest clothes, his snow boots, and his cozy hat, and he ran outside to join his friends in the snowy wonderland. The children in the village were thrilled with the snow. They built snow forts, had snowball fights, and even made snow angels. They took turns riding on sleds down the small hill near their homes, shouting with glee as they zoomed down the slope. Reg had a blast playing with his friends in the snow, and he quickly learned that snow days were his favorite days, as there was no school and they could play all day long. After hours of play, the children started to feel tired. They returned to their homes, their cheeks flushed from the cold and their hearts filled with joy from the wonderful day they had together. Reg went to bed that night, dreaming of the fantastic snowy adventures he had with his friends. The next day, the snow began to melt, and the village returned to its usual appearance. The children returned to school, and life went back to normal. Despite craving more snow days, Reg had to accept that the snow was gone for now. As the days passed, the memories of their snow day were still fresh in Reg's mind, and he longed to experience it once more. Every night, he would make a wish before bedtime, hoping for another snowy day. One day, Reg woke up to the sight of giant snowflakes falling from the sky. He couldn't believe his eyes! It was snowing again! Reg quickly got dressed and ran outside to play with his friends. The village was once again filled with laughter and excitement as the children spent their day in the snow. As the sun set, Reg returned home, his heart swelling with happiness from the second snow day he had experienced. The snow continued to fall that night, and Reg knew that there would be no school the next day either. Filled with joy and anticipation for another fun day ahead, Reg went to bed that night with his wish fulfilled, and he hoped that he would get another snow day soon.

Select the topic that this about: Anglo-US fund firm Amvescap has announced a 50 percent cut to its interim dividend but says it plans to return to a progressive dividend policy for 2005 onwards. Choices: i. World. ii. Sports. iii. Business. iv. Science/Tech.","response":"The topic of this passage is about Anglo-US fund firm Amvescap announcing a 50 percent cut to its interim dividend but having plans to return to a progressive dividend policy for 2005 onwards. This information is related to the financial and corporate world, focusing on a specific company's business decisions and plans. Thus, the correct choice is: iii. Business. The passage centers around Amvescap, an Anglo-US investment management company. The announcement of a 50 percent cut to its interim dividend demonstrates the company's adjustments to cope with financial circumstances. An interim dividend refers to a payment made to shareholders of a company before the final financial results are determined. It is usually distributed by the board of directors, acting as a gesture of confidence in the company's future performance. However, the announcement also highlights Amvescap's intention to return to a progressive dividend policy for 2005 onwards. A progressive dividend policy is a strategy where a company regularly increases its dividend payments to shareholders in a steady and predictable manner. This can be an effective way for companies to incentivize and retain investors, as a consistent increase in dividends attracts investors focused on steady income streams and long-term growth potential. In the passage, Amvescap's announcement reflects its financial decisions, market strategy, and efforts to communicate their plans for future growth. These elements directly pertain to the realm of business, as they involve a company's corporate decisions and their effect on investors and financial markets. The passage does not deal with world events or international news (choice i), nor does it talk about any sports-related information (choice ii). Lastly, it doesn't discuss scientific or technological advancements or events (choice iv). Thus, the most fitting topic for this passage is business, making option iii the correct choice."},{"question":"(AP) WASHINGTON — In a rare concession on a highly sensitive issue, Chinese President Hu Jintao used his White House visit on Wednesday to acknowledge \\"a lot still needs to be done\\" to improve human rights in his nation accused of repressing its people. President Barack Obama pushed China to adopt fundamental freedoms but assured Hu the U.S. considers the communist nation a friend and vital economic partner. Hu's comments met with immediate skepticism from human rights advocates, who dismissed them as words backed by no real history of action. Hu contended his country has \\"made enormous progress\\" but provided no specifics. Still, his remarks seemed to hearten and surprise U.S. officials, coming during an elaborate visit that centered on boosting trade and trust between the world's two largest economies. More broadly, Hu and Obama sought to show off a more mature and respectful relationship, not the one often defined by disputes over currency, sovereignty and freedoms. Hu said he wanted even closer contact with Obama; Obama sought again to embrace China's rise, and the two men shared some unexpected laughs. The Chinese president was treated lavishly, granted the honor of the third state dinner of Obama's presidency. He was welcomed in the morning to the sounds of military bands and the smiles of children on the South Lawn; he was capping the evening at a black-tie White House gala of jazz musicians and all-American food. Eager to show progress, particularly with the unemployment weighing down his country, Obama said the nations sealed business deals that would mean 45 billion in U.S. exports and create roughly 235,000 jobs. The package included moves by China to expand U.S. investment and curtail theft of intellectual property. China's human rights record is poor and worsening, with abuses ranging from censorship to illegal detention of dissidents to executions without due process, according to the U.S. government. In a packed news conference - one designed to underscore the freedom of speech on Obama's home turf - Hu was pressed to defend his country's treatment of its people. He initially did not answer, saying he never heard the question translated, although the White House said that it was. When prodded a second time, Hu defended his country's promotion of human rights. But then he added that China is enduring challenges as it develops and \\"a lot still needs to be done in China in terms of human rights.\\" He said China stood to gain from other countries' input, saying: \\"We're also willing to learn.\\" Click here for more info, or scroll down for additional updates. ||||| President Obama, hosting Chinese President Hu Jintao on a state visit, said Wednesday that the United States welcomes the \\"peaceful rise\\" of China and urged the one-party state to improve its human rights record. In a news conference at the White House after talks with Hu and other top Chinese officials, Obama said the two countries have agreed to \\"move ahead with our formal dialogue on human rights. We've agreed to new exchanges to advance the rule of law.\\" He referred to a human rights dialogue that was launched more than a year ago but that so far has produced only one meeting. Obama also announced that a series of new commercial deals would increase U.S. exports to China by more than 45 billion, supporting about 235,000 American jobs, including many manufacturing jobs. At the same time, he said, China would boost investments in the United States by several billion dollars. \\"As we look to the future, what's needed, I believe, is a spirit of cooperation that is also friendly competition,\\" Obama said. Hu said China is willing to have a dialogue on human rights but that it should be based on \\"mutual respect and the principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs.\\" he acknowledged that \\"a lot still needs to be done in China\\" on human rights. Hu said China \\"is always committed to the protection and promotion of human rights\\" and that the country has made \\"enormous progress\\" that is widely recognized around the world. The series of meetings with Hu at the White House included one attended by U.S. business leaders. Obama said at that meeting that he wants specific ideas on removing barriers to trade with China and protecting U.S. intellectual property. Hu said China is trying to increase its domestic consumption, a move that would relieve pressure to boost exports as a way to achieve economic growth. Obama said at the news conference that an expansion of domestic demand in China not only would help U.S. exporters but would contribute to raising China's standard of living. \\"I absolutely believe that China's peaceful rise is good for the world, and it's good for America,\\" Obama said in response to a Chinese reporter's question. He said later in answer to another question: \\"We welcome China's rise. We just want to make sure that that rise occurs in a way that reinforces international norms, international rules and enhances security and peace, as opposed to it being a source of conflict in the region or around the world.\\" Earlier, Obama welcomed Hu to the White House with warm words about cooperation and sober reminders of the high stakes of the relationship between the two superpowers and the global importance of universal freedoms. \\"We have an enormous stake in each other's success,\\" Obama said. \\"Nations, including our own, will be more prosperous and more secure when we work together.\\" In his remarks, Hu said he hoped to \\"increase mutual trust\\" between China and the United States during his visit and build a \\"comprehensive\\" friendship for the 21st century. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Chinese President Hu Jintao acknowledged the need for improvement in human rights in China during his White House visit, amid President Barack Obama's push for China to adopt fundamental freedoms.

Kevin had to use more sunscreen when at the beach tanning than Justin because","response":"Kevin's fair complexion made him more susceptible to the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays, and therefore, provided him with a higher risk of developing sunburns and, in the long run, potentially increasing his chances of experiencing skin-related issues like photoaging and skin cancer. Additionally, individuals with paler skin tend not to tan as easily, often requiring more cautious and diligent sun care practices. Sunscreen is an essential tool in protecting oneself from these harmful UV rays, and Kevin, being aware of his skin's vulnerability, knew that he needed to apply a more generous amount of sunscreen in comparison to Justin, who seemed to possess a more resilient skin tone. Factors influencing this difference may range from genetic predispositions, ancestry, and exposure to sunlight over time. However, Kevin was not discouraged; he understood that every individual's skin is unique, and that acknowledging and catering to these differences is a crucial aspect of maintaining healthy skin. As the two friends lay side by side under the warm sunrays, Kevin would consistently reapply his broad-spectrum sunscreen every two hours, or immediately after swimming or sweating profusely. This diligent application offered him protection from both UVA and UVB rays, reducing the potential for sunburns and long-term skin damage. In contrast, Justin would apply a lower SPF and reapply less frequently, relying more on his skin's natural melanin to provide a heightened defense against the sun. Over time, Justin developed a deeper, sun-kissed tan, while Kevin maintained his lighter complexion but with a subtle tan. Instead of feeling envious, Kevin took pride in knowing he was taking care of his skin and minimizing the risks associated with excessive UV exposure. This experience served as a reminder to both Kevin and Justin of the importance of proper sun protection—no matter one's skin tone—and the need to adjust sunscreen application habits according to each individual's unique characteristics, ultimately promoting a safer, healthier, and more enjoyable beach tanning experience for all."},{"question":"Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story is a 2005 direct-to-DVD animated comedy film set in the Family Guy fictional universe.

Question: What was the Fighting Irish hockey team originally affiliated with? Context: Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.

I move to repel the rule regarding obligatory school uniform. He moved his hand slightly to the right.","response":"First, let's analyze the meanings in both sentences: 1. In the sentence \\"I move to repel the rule regarding obligatory school uniform,\\" the word \\"move\\" refers to the action of proposing or initiating a change or an action, usually in a formal setting like a meeting or a debate. 2. In the sentence \\"He moved his hand slightly to the right,\\" the word \\"move\\" refers to the physical action of changing the position of a body part, in this case, the hand. Now, let's assess if the meanings are the same: While both sentences use the word \\"move,\\" the meanings are different based on the context in which the word is used. In the first sentence, \\"move\\" conveys the idea of proposing or initiating a change, whereas in the second sentence, \\"move\\" refers to a physical action of changing a position.

Why didn't they just give the money to the poor?\\" The question about cathedrals was asked by a student to Mr. Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral. \\"That's a good question,\\" he replied. \\"Partly to inspire them - to get them to look up with awe.\\" I'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone, but this movie certainly had that impact on me. It was awesome! It didn't start out that way. For a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of - well - a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral. If you've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it. You have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day, the bus driver who's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt was my initial reaction. I figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students. YAWN! But it turns out to be so much more! Timothy Spall was brilliant as Mr. Harvey - a sombre, unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals. Over the course of the movie, his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story. We also get introduced to some of the troubled students - most notably Helen, also brilliantly played by Nathalie Press, who's into self-mutilation. This isn't a religious movie, but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes. When Harvey's colleague Jonathon (played by Ben Miles) says \\"I don't care what anyone believes as long as they don't try to force it on anyone else\\" Harvey replies, \\"that isn't tolerance - it's indifference!\\" - which is, in fact (in my opinion) what often passes for religious tolerance in our society. There are scenes of reconciliation between various characters, and the final scene of the movie was brilliant. As Harvey climbs back on the bus, director Susanna White has the camera slowly pan upwards, so that the final shot is simply of the sky - hearkening back to Harvey's comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe. The cathedral accomplishes its goal. We look up into the universe in awe, seeking something greater than ourselves, however we choose to define it.

Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... A:","response":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question The question asks whether PepsiCo potatoes (GMO) would be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods' potatoes (non-GMO). Step 2: Define important terms and concepts GMO potatoes have had their genetic material altered through genetic engineering techniques, which can include traits like herbicide tolerance. Herbicide-resistant crops have a gene that allows them to tolerate exposure to herbicides without being harmed. Non-GMO potatoes have not had their genetic material altered in this way. Step 3: Analyze the information provided The hint states that genetic engineering can create crops with increased herbicide tolerance. PepsiCo uses GMO potato seeds, while Kettle Foods uses non-GMO potato seeds. Step 4: Apply the information to determine the level of herbicide tolerance Considering that GMO potatoes have been specifically engineered to resist herbicides, it is likely that PepsiCo's GMO potatoes would be more herbicide-tolerant than Kettle Foods' non-GMO potatoes. Step 5: Justify the conclusion Since genetic engineering allows breeders to create crops with higher levels of herbicide tolerance, and PepsiCo uses these GMO potato seeds, PepsiCo's potatoes are likely to be more herbicide-tolerant compared to Kettle Foods' potatoes, which are non-GMO. This difference in herbicide tolerance may result in an increased use of herbicides for the management of weeds in PepsiCo's production, while Kettle Foods may need to use alternative weed management techniques. Conclusion: PepsiCo potatoes (GMO) would be more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods' potatoes (non-GMO), as genetic engineering allows for the development of crops with higher levels of herbicide resistance, and PepsiCo is using these engineered seeds in their production."},{"question":"Tällä asialla, merkittävillä ja laiminlyödyillä taudeilla kehitysmaissa, on merkittävä ihmisoikeudellinen ulottuvuus. Translate to English","response":"On this issue, significant and neglected diseases in developing countries have a considerable human rights dimension. This statement highlights the importance of addressing neglected diseases in developing countries from both a public health and human rights perspective. Neglected diseases refer to a group of infectious diseases that primarily affect marginalized populations living in impoverished areas of the world. These diseases are often overlooked and underfunded, leading to a lack of access to prevention, treatment, and care for those who need it most. The human rights dimension of neglected diseases stems from the fact that access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and numerous international human rights treaties. Inadequate attention to these diseases implies that the rights of millions of people – particularly those living in poverty – are not being sufficiently respected, protected, and fulfilled. This situation represents a failure of the global community in terms of prioritizing equitable health development and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. The impact of neglected diseases in developing countries is significant. Some of the most common neglected diseases include lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), leprosy, Chagas disease, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. These diseases can cause severe physical and emotional pain, long-term disabilities, and social stigmatization. In many cases, these illnesses can be fatal if left untreated. Moreover, neglected diseases contribute to a vicious cycle of poverty, as those affected are often unable to work or participate in community life, thereby perpetuating their marginalization and lack of opportunities for advancement. Addressing neglected diseases in developing countries requires a comprehensive, multisectoral approach guided by human rights principles. Such an approach should prioritize the needs and well-being of the affected individuals and communities and promote greater equity in healthcare access, prevention, and treatment. Some of the key elements to effectively address neglected diseases from a human rights perspective include: 1. Increasing awareness and political commitment: National governments, international organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders need to acknowledge and prioritize neglected diseases on their policy agendas. Greater attention should be given to ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to research, prevention, treatment, and care related to these diseases. 2. Strengthening health systems: Investments in healthcare infrastructure and human resources are crucial to ensuring that developing countries can provide necessary care for populations affected by neglected diseases. This includes establishing and maintaining networks of clinics and hospitals, training and retaining healthcare professionals, as well as ensuring the availability of necessary equipment and supplies. 3. Promoting prevention and early detection: Governments should invest in public health campaigns targeting neglected diseases, with a focus on raising awareness about risk factors, prevention measures, and early detection. This could include efforts to improve water and sanitation systems, enhance vector control strategies, and promote vaccination campaigns. 4. Ensuring access to treatment and care: Universal access to effective, affordable, and quality healthcare must be prioritized. Governments and international organizations can play a crucial role in negotiating lower prices for essential medicines and diagnostics related to neglected diseases, as well as providing technical assistance and funding for healthcare providers. 5. Empowering affected communities: Individuals and communities affected by neglected diseases should be involved in decision-making processes related to healthcare policies and programs. Community engagement can help to address stigma, improve compliance with preventive measures and treatment, and foster a sense of ownership in the success of disease control initiatives. By addressing the human rights dimensions of neglected diseases, the global community can work together to ensure that the most vulnerable populations have access to the healthcare they need, reducing the suffering and socioeconomic impacts associated with these devastating illnesses."},{"question":"Find the right ending to this passage.

(Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren. contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people whose employers forbid them from creating a human-animal hybrid?, what is it ?

In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden.

He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo was born on 15 April 1452 (Old Style) \\"at the third hour of the night\\" in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, in the lower valley of the Arno river in the territory of the Medici-ruled Republic of Florence. He was the out-of-wedlock son of the wealthy Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci, a Florentine legal notary, and Caterina, a peasant. Leonardo had no surname in the modern sense - \\"da Vinci\\" simply meaning \\"of Vinci\\"; his full birth name was \\"Lionardo di ser Piero da Vinci\\", meaning \\"Leonardo, (son) of (Mes)ser Piero from Vinci\\". The inclusion of the title \\"ser\\" indicated that Leonardo's father was a gentleman. Little is known about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first five years in the hamlet of Anchiano in the home of his mother, and from 1457 lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle in the small town of Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children: Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children: Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni). In all, Leonardo had twelve half-siblings, who were much younger than him (the last was born when Leonardo was forty years old) and with whom he had very few contacts, but they caused him difficulty after his father's death in the dispute over the inheritance. Leonardo received an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he regarded as an omen, was when a kite dropped from the sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out what was inside. Leonardo's early life has been the subject of historical conjecture. Vasari, the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: A local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant. Who was his father","response":"Leonardo da Vinci's father was Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci. He was a wealthy Florentine legal notary. Leonardo was born out of wedlock, which means his parents were not married when he was born. His father later got married a few times and had more children."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence from the Quran in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

When President Obama talked about these mean Islamic terrorists, he didn't want people to be too scared. He sometimes made it seem like these terrorists were not as bad as they really were. He didn't want everyone to be scared, so he said that these terrorists were not a big problem. But some people think that President Obama should have told everyone how big and scary the problem with these mean terrorists really was. In his speeches, which are like big talks he gave, President Obama didn't say that the problem with these mean terrorists was a big deal. He wanted people to stay calm and not worry too much.

The goal is to determine how different factors interact and influence each other, assess the outcomes of various actions, and use this information to make decisions or propose solutions. Here is a detailed example of a task that could test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning: **Task: Design and Construct a Model Bridge** **Objective:** Evaluate the structural integrity, weight-bearing capacity, and efficiency of materials used in building a model bridge and optimize its design to meet certain constraints. **Instructions:** 1. Research: Begin by researching different types of bridge designs, such as beam, truss, arch, and suspension bridges. Gain an understanding of the principles of tension, compression, and balance that influence the stability of bridges. Consider the environmental factors such as wind, temperature changes, and natural disasters that may impact the bridge's stability and study the various materials (wood, steel, concrete, etc.) used in bridge construction. 2. Analyze Constraints: Establish the project guidelines and constraints which may include: - Maximum length, width, and height of the bridge - Maximum budget for materials and construction - The minimum weight-bearing capacity the bridge must support - The terrain and environmental conditions the bridge must accommodate 3. Design: Develop several potential bridge designs that fulfill the established constraints. Utilize the individual's knowledge of physics principles, such as forces, torque, and equilibrium, to optimize the designs for maximum efficiency, weight capacity, and structural integrity. Consider the choice of materials, connections, and potential weak points in the design. Use sketching, computer-aided design programs, or physical models to clearly convey the design concepts. 4. Selection and Construction: Choose the best design based on an analysis of pros and cons, taking into account both structural and financial considerations. Create a list of required materials, tools, and measurements, and then proceed to build the model bridge according to the chosen design, paying close attention to precision and accuracy. 5. Testing: Perform a series of tests to assess the bridge's stability, load-bearing capacity, and response to external forces such as wind or vibrations. Record and analyze the results, comparing them to the initial design goals and expectations. 6. Iteration and Improvement: If the bridge fails to meet the desired criteria, identify the areas of weakness and determine possible solutions to increase its performance. Make modifications to the design and, if necessary, rebuild the bridge with these improvements. Repeat the testing phase to evaluate the success of the changes. 7. Reflection and Presentation: Summarize the process and results of the project, highlighting the application of physical reasoning, key decisions, challenges faced, and improvements made. Present the completed bridge model and provide an explanation of the design choices and evaluation of the project's success. This task challenges individuals to apply their understanding of structural mechanics, materials properties, and physics principles to devise a functional, efficient, and stable bridge design. Through the stages of research, design, construction, testing, and iterations, participants can showcase and develop their physical reasoning abilities, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking capacity."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Options: - park - reduce - descend - fall - set reasoning:","response":"The correct answer is \\"descend\\". Reasoning: An elevator works by using a counterweight to balance the weight of the elevator car. The counterweight is connected to the elevator car with a cable that is wound around a drum. The winding and unwinding of the cable on the drum allows the elevator to move up and down. In the context of the mine, when the counterweight begins to rise, it means that the cable is unwinding from the drum, thus allowing the elevator car to move downwards into the mine. Therefore, the elevator begins to descend (move downward) into the mine when the counterweight rises."},{"question":"Sentence: 1634: The Galileo Affair is written in the English language.

Article: Relation between the United States and Columbia suffered for many years because of an incident involving the Republic of Panama. By the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, many Americans felt that an easier and faster way was needed to get ships from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Some people in the United States first believed that a canal across Nicaragua was the answer. However, President Theodore Roosevelt decided that a canal through Panama would be a better choice. In order to build the canal , the United States had to negotiate a treaty with Columbia , which at that time controlled Panama . Roosevelt offered Columbia 10 million plus 250,000 a year for 99 years for a six-mile-wide strip of land across Panama. Columbia rejected the United States' offer. This ranged President Roosevelt, and negotiations with Columbia ended. In 1903, a revolution broke out in Panama. The United States ships were sent by President Roosevelt to protect the Panamanian revolutionaries from Columbian forces. The revolution succeeded, and Panama declared its independence from Columbia. The United States then negotiated with the newly formed government. A treaty was signed, and the United States began building the canal. As a result of the incident, Columbia and the United States remained on bad terms for many years. Not until 1921, when the United States agreed to pay Columbia some compensation for its territory, did relations between the two countries improve. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that an important reason for the decision of the United States to build a canal was to _ . Options: A: develop trade relations with Europe B: improve relations with South American countries C: prevent European ships from reaching the Pacific Ocean D: reduce travel time for its ships in case of war Answer:","response":"D: reduce travel time for its ships in case of war Step-by-step justification: 1. The article mentions that by the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, many Americans felt that an easier and faster way was needed to get ships from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. 2. This suggests that the main motivation for building a canal was to reduce travel time for ships, which would strategically benefit the United States during conflicts or wars. 3. While trade relations and improving relations with other countries may have been secondary benefits, these are not explicitly mentioned as the primary reasons in the passage. The passage also doesn't mention any intent to prevent European ships from reaching the Pacific Ocean. 4.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany. When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill – the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the cracks are wide and deep happens, how will it affect cracks expand less. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"To analyze the effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the process, let's break down each step and consider the changes brought by wider and deeper cracks: 1. Water gets into cracks in rocks: Wider and deeper cracks will allow more water to enter the rock's structure. This could potentially lead to an increased amount of water infiltrating the rock, which would cause even larger ice formation in the following steps. 2. The water freezes into ice: With increased water infiltration, the formation of ice in the wider and deeper cracks will be more substantial. Moreover, as the cracks are wider and deeper, the ice will have more room to grow. 3. The cracks expand: Typically, as the water freezes into ice, its volume increases, causing significant pressure on the rocks and resulting in the cracks expanding. With wider and deeper cracks, the expansion might be less pronounced since there is more room for the ice to grow. However, due to the increased amount of ice forming within the wider and deeper cracks, the overall pressure on the surrounding rocks might still be substantial, albeit potentially less impactful. 4. Over time the rocks split: As the freeze-thaw cycle continues, the wider and deeper cracks will still cause the rocks to split eventually, but the process may be somewhat slower due to the initially larger volume of space available for ice growth. 5. The rocks are now in smaller pieces: The end result remains the same: the rocks break into smaller pieces. Although wider and deeper cracks may slow down the process, they will not prevent the eventual fragmentation of the rocks. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have an indirect effect on the process, as wider and deeper cracks may slightly slow down the overall rate of rock fragmentation. The ice may well expand less in these wider cracks, but the process still results in the rocks splitting into smaller pieces."},{"question":"1. Her mother is Kenyan while her father is Austrian . 2.

Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - The Nova Scotia Legislature, formally, known as the General Assembly, consists of the Crown represented by a Lieutenant Governor and the House of Assembly, is the legislative branch of the provincial government of Nova Scotia, Canada. The assembly is the oldest in Canada, having first sat in 1758, and in 1848 was the site of the first responsible government in the British Empire. - Andrew Younger is a Canadian politician , who was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 2009 provincial election .

Yes or no? Answer: Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes, such as the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation. Question: what is the purpose of vitamin d A:","response":"The purpose of Vitamin D is multifaceted, as it plays a crucial role in various physiological processes that are essential for maintaining overall health and wellbeing. Vitamin D, particularly in its biologically active form, calcitriol, serves many purposes relating to bone health, immune function, cell growth, neuromuscular function, and inflammation regulation. Here is a detailed overview of the main purposes of Vitamin D: 1. Bone health and metabolism: One of the primary functions of Vitamin D is to facilitate the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the gut, essential minerals that contribute to building strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D maintains calcium and phosphate levels in the blood, ensuring the proper mineralization of bone and preventing disorders such as rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in adults. 2. Immune function: Vitamin D is known to enhance the function of immune cells, such as T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages, modulating the body's immune responses. It plays a role in both the innate and adaptive immune systems, helping to fight infections, reduce the risk of autoimmune diseases, and potentially protect against certain cancers. 3. Cell growth and differentiation: Calcitriol, the active form of Vitamin D, can stimulate the growth and differentiation of cells, which is an essential process for maintaining healthy tissues and organs. By doing so, it helps regulate the cell cycle, prevents tumor formation, and maintains the normal functioning of various cell types, including skin, breast, prostate, and colon cells. 4. Neuromuscular function: Vitamin D is necessary for proper nerve function, as it helps regulate calcium levels within nerve cells, ensuring the correct transmission of signals between the cells. Moreover, Vitamin D plays a role in muscle function by supporting muscle contraction, growth, and strength. 5. Inflammation regulation: Calcitriol has anti-inflammatory properties, meaning it can help regulate inflammatory responses within the body. This is essential for maintaining overall health, as chronic inflammation has been associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 6. Brain health and cognition: Emerging evidence suggests that Vitamin D may play a role in maintaining brain health and preventing cognitive decline. Vitamin D receptors are present in various regions of the brain, and research has found associations between Vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In summary, Vitamin D serves a multitude of purposes within the body, including maintaining bone health, regulating immune function, promoting cell growth and differentiation, supporting neuromuscular function, modulating inflammation, and potentially preserving brain health. Ensuring adequate levels of Vitamin D is vital for maintaining overall health and preventing various diseases."},{"question":"Question: In the chronology of academic institutions, where are Christian cathedral schools compared to universities?

Article: In much society, there is often greater acceptance of light skin than dark skin; Light skin may be seen as a mark of beauty, intelligence and success. These beliefs can lead to social pressures even within the same group, if some members are darker than others. The result is that skin lightening has become very common across Africa, Asia and other areas of the world and more people with dark skin are using skin-lighting products, even if it means they may face health risks. They believe that having whiter skin will improve the quality of their lives. Many people think they will have a better family. Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful. Some beauty care products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. However, some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural barrier to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolored. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, which just makes things even worse. Doctor Ly says some chemicals are so dangerous that they may lead to blackened fingernails, infections and serious skin damage. And these are not the only problems. Experts say some people who change their skin color suffer emotional damage. They feel regretful and sad. They feel that instead of risking their health, they should have learned to live and accept their skin color as it was. Question: Why are chemicals in beauty care products dangerous? Options: A: They can damage the skin's color producing progress. B: They can control people's emotions and feelings. C: They can make the fingernails and skin black. D: They make more people decide to change their skin colors. A:","response":"The chemicals in beauty care products are dangerous for several reasons as mentioned in the article. The foremost danger is that these chemicals can block and break down the skin's natural barrier against sunlight, leading to thick and discolored skin. This can be tied up with option A, “They can damage the skin's color producing progress,” even though the article doesn't explicitly describe that the chemicals interfere with melanin production - the pigment that gives skin its color. The article also mentions that the use of such harmful chemicals may lead to blackened fingernails, infections, and severe skin damage which corresponds to option C, “They can make the fingernails and skin black.” This, however, doesn't cover the wide spectrum of potential dangers highlighted in the article, such as discolored skin or infections. On the other hand, options B and D seem less credible based on the information given in the article. While option B states, “They can control people's emotions and feelings”, the article does point out that the individuals who have changed their skin color often experience emotional distress. However, these feelings of regret and sadness are a result of the individuals' actions and the societal pressures they face, not a direct result of the chemicals themselves. Thus, it can't be said that the chemicals in beauty care products \\"control\\" people's emotions and feelings. Option D, “They make more people decide to change their skin colors” sounds more like a statement of the products' attractiveness or appeal to the consumers who aspire to have lighter skin due to societal pressures. However, the article doesn't suggest that the chemicals themselves are the reason more people are deciding to change their skin colors. To conclude, based on the information from the article, the most encompassing and accurate answer might be a combination of options A and C, as they both highlight the potential for skin and physical damage caused by chemicals in these products. However, the dangers highlighted in the article are not limited only to these aspects since they also include emotional distress (which stems from societal pressures rather than the chemicals themselves)."},{"question":"Instructions: Given a sentence in Spanish, generate a new Spanish sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

However, I will attempt to provide an assessment by breaking down various factors that constitute a quality review and addressing the review's content. 1. Relevance: A helpful review should be directly related to the subject matter. In this case, the statement \\"I hacked coc\\" could be referring to the popular mobile game \\"Clash of Clans\\" (CoC). If the review is intended for an app, product, or service related to Clash of Clans, then it may have some relevance, albeit minimal. However, if there is no connection to Clash of Clans or hacking within the context of the review, it may not serve any relevant purpose. Rating: 1-2. 2. Depth: A comprehensive review should provide insightful analysis or personal experience, allowing prospective consumers to make an informed decision about the product. The review in question does not provide any background information about the nature of the alleged hacking, how it was carried out, or its impact. As a result, it does not add any meaningful insight for other users. Rating: 1. 3. Clarity: Clear communication is critical for a quality review, allowing readers to understand the reviewer's opinion and reasoning. This terse statement is vague, as it is uncertain whether the reviewer is expressing a positive experience (e.g., easily overcoming in-game challenges through hacking) or a negative one (e.g., frustration due to hacking affecting the gaming experience). Rating: 1. 4. Grammar and Spelling: Proper spelling and grammar make a review more readable and credible. Although this statement contains no grammatical errors, it uses internet slang (\\"coc\\" instead of \\"Clash of Clans\\") and lacks punctuation, which may not be accessible or understandable to all readers. Rating: 2. 5. Constructiveness: An ideal review should offer constructive feedback so that developers or manufacturers can improve their products or respond to concerns. The statement \\"I hacked coc\\" contains no actionable feedback, suggestions for improvement, or clear indication of the reviewer's expectations. Rating: 1. Taking these factors into consideration, my overall rating for this review would be between 1 and 2, closer to 1. The review is vague and uninformative, and it does not provide any meaningful insight or feedback that would help others make a decision about the product or the app. Therefore, I would rate this review as \\"1 - least favorable\\" based on the provided scale."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Diaghilev turned to? During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".

David Flory, 68, was arrested Sunday at a Starbucks in Albuquerque on 40 counts of promoting prostitution. The professor, who has taught at Farleigh Dickinson University since 1969, has a vacation home in New Mexico. A specialist in elementary particle theory, Flory also spent a decade in the school administration, where he said he spent time working on human resource database systems and measuring academic productivity -- skills that were evident from the three-tiered system police say he created for rating the privileges of johns who used the prostitution service. Flory, a married father of three according to his personal website, was being held on a 100,000 bond Tuesday. He didn't respond to an e-mail message. His wife didn't return a phone message left at the couple's New York apartment. Albuquerque Police Lt. William Roseman told The Associated Press that Flory's password-protected website, Southwest Companions, had been the subject of a vice investigation for the last six months after police received tips from prostitutes and johns. Roseman said the site had been in operation about three years and had about 1,400 members -- about 200 prostitutes and about 1,200 johns. Most of the members were in the Albuquerque-Santa Fe area, though some postings originated in Phoenix and Denver. Flory and his wife, Sharon, a psychotherapist specializing in eating disorders, live in an apartment on New York's Upper West Side, about 10 miles from the Fairleigh Dickinson campus. They have a vacation house in Santa Fe called Casa de Los Arboles, or \\"house of the trees.\\" The alleged prostitution site apparently didn't make a lot of money. \\"He said he was not in this for the money,\\" Roseman told the AP. \\"He flat-out told us his thing was he wanted to create a safe place for prostitutes and johns to get together. He called it a hobby.\\" Roseman said Flory \\"had dates set up\\" with the prostitutes when he came to New Mexico but couldn't say for sure what happened during those encounters. Police said the Southwest Companions website had three levels or ratings for johns: probation, verified and trust. \\"In order to get off probation you had to sleep with one of the prostitutes on the website and she in turn would tell the moderator (Flory) what acts occurred, how much they paid and any comments,\\" he said. \\"That opened you up to verified status. Once you got into verified status that opened you up to different girls available. Then, some would e-mail the moderator, \`This is the act, this is how much he paid, these are my comments about it.\\"' After so many of those, Roseman said, members moved into trusted status, which afforded access to features such as training videos on what do if you got caught by police. Members who reached the trusted level also could rate prostitutes. Samantha Agosto, a 21-year-old nursing student at FDU who had Flory as a tutor a few years ago, said she never found anything either odd or remarkable about him. \\"I never got that creepy vibe from him,\\" she said in a telephone interview. \\"He was very friendly and very willing to give of himself to help a student, very willing to give his time.\\" According to Flory's personal website, he has two daughters, a stepdaughter and four grandchildren. In an interview with a university publication in February, he said he is a certified scuba diver and also said he has considered attempting a career in theatrical lighting design, a pursuit he'd followed in high school and college. Referring to his time spent in the administration, he wrote on his website: \\"Now I spend a lot of my time working and playing with computer systems and software.\\" A Fairleigh Dickinson University spokeswoman said the school was saddened by the arrest, but did not say if Flory had been suspended from his job.

Barely a week after the Pentagon said it planned to close the 96-year-old hospital between Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue, real estate brokers, D.C. planners, developers and politicians were laying claim to the property, a sign of the complicated discussions that ensue when the federal government pulls up stakes. The 113-acre complex is in the middle of an increasingly affluent neighborhood convenient to downtown and also is near the burgeoning commercial area of Silver Spring -- factors that argue for dense residential, retail or office development. But it is also a historic place, where war heroes and presidents have recuperated, and its redevelopment could trigger a preservation fight. And as a federal property, its decommissioning as a military hospital would be governed by tight restrictions, such as that the campus must first be offered to other government agencies. D.C. officials and neighborhood residents also would want a say. \\"What's attractive about Walter Reed is its size,\\" said Thomas R. Maskey, a senior vice president at Peterson Cos., a Northern Virginia developer of mixed-use projects. \\"There's not 113 acres anywhere around here that's going to be available. The size allows you to do a lot of different things that can really have an impact.\\" With congressional review of the Pentagon's base-closing plan ahead, it could be years before Walter Reed closes, and it may not happen at all if local officials succeed in blocking the proposed transfer of hospital staff to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda and Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County. And it could take years more before a plan for the property took shape. \\"There's a lot of legwork that has to be done before you can break ground and start redeveloping a site,\\" said Tim Ford, executive director of the Association of Defense Communities, a nonprofit group that tracks base closings and redevelopments across the country. \\"Just getting the land from the federal government is tough.\\" The Washington region is no stranger to the federal government rearranging its land use, but the aftermath isn't always consistent. The Cameron Station military base in Alexandria was quickly redeveloped into a mostly residential neighborhood after it was closed in the late 1990s. The District, in contrast, has been in a protracted debate over the fate of the federally operated and largely defunct St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Southeast. The 40-acre Southeast Federal Center was turned over to the District -- sort of. It is being redeveloped as a new headquarters for the Transportation Department, with some of the property slated for a private housing, retail and office development. Walter Reed, based on its size, history and location, would probably pose an even more complicated development problem. Ford said that when the military vacated its prime piece of real estate in San Francisco's Presidio, for example, there was a \\"constant battle\\" among residents, developers and D.C. officials before a compromise was reached to keep part of the 1,480-acre site as parkland and use other parts for commercial space. Developers said there would be no shortage of interest or ideas for the Walter Reed campus, which brokers said is worth 80 million to 100 million. Developer John Shooshan of Arlington, who has done office buildings and housing projects, said that because Walter Reed sits in a mostly residential area, bordering Rock Creek Park, it could be developed into a combination of single-family homes, condominiums and apartments. Summary:","response":"The Pentagon's proposal to close the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington has sparked interest from real estate brokers, developers and politicians, as the 113-acre site is situated in an increasingly affluent area near to downtown and Silver Spring. The size of the plot could allow for a range of developments, however, the historic nature of the site could trigger a preservation fight. Additionally, as a federal property, the campus would need to be offered to other government agencies first. The Pentagon's base-closing plan is still under congressional review, and it may be years before any development can take place."},{"question":"Article:The M62 has reopened after being closed eastbound at J21 Milnrow and westbound at J22 on the A672 Ripponden.

It also causes you to sweat, which can make the chafing worse. Avoid wearing clothes that are resting directly on your skin. Wear reasonably loose-fitting clothes to avoid friction and give your skin time to heal. Avoid tight belts, tight underwear, and clothes that cause you to sweat. All of these are keeping your skin from breathing and can make your chafing worse. In the winter, you may want to do the opposite. Looser clothes may trap your body heat and make you sweat more. Wear cotton whenever you can. Fancy polyester shirts and denim trousers may be tempting, but they can trap heat and cause you to sweat which can trigger chafing. Cotton dresses, shorts, and shirts are easy to find in a variety of styles as well. Giving your skin room to breathe is the best way to give the skin time to repair naturally. In general, you should always choose materials that feel good against your skin. Avoid any materials such as wool and leather. Many people chafe between the thighs when they’re running or working out. If this is you, pick up a pair of tight-fitting anti-chafing shorts. These shorts have padding for your thighs to keep the friction from doing damage. Since it’s hard to let this area breathe, this is probably the best way to handle the irritation. The minerals and oils in your skin transfer to your clothing after you wear it. When you re-wear clothing, you’re exposing your chaffed skin to those minerals and oils.

This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.

Options: - making love - feel good - happyness - wonderful thing - cloud judgment reasoning:","response":"Sex often makes various things happen in people, including: 1. Making love: Sex is a physical expression of love and intimacy between individuals. It can serve to strengthen the emotional bond between partners, making them feel closer and more connected. 2. Feel good: During sex, the brain releases various chemicals, such as oxytocin, endorphins, and dopamine, which contribute to feelings of pleasure, satisfaction, and well-being. These chemicals can help relieve stress and produce a sense of euphoria. 3. Happiness: Many individuals experience increased happiness after engaging in sexual activity. This is often a result of the release of feel-good chemicals mentioned earlier, as well as the emotional connection between partners. Regular sexual activity has been linked to higher levels of happiness. 4. Wonderful thing: People often refer to sex as a wonderful and enjoyable experience. This feeling can arise from the physical pleasure experienced during the act, as well as the emotional satisfaction it brings. 5. Cloud judgment: Sex can sometimes cloud a person's judgment, particularly when strong feelings of attraction or lust are involved. This might lead to poor decision-making, such as engaging in risky sexual behavior or allowing the sexual aspect of a relationship to overshadow other important aspects, like compatibility and communication. In summary, sex can lead to various experiences and feelings in people, such as making love, feeling good, happiness, and even clouding judgment in certain situations.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Bees make honey for elephants\\" - Sentence B: \\"Bees make honey for their children\\" Please answer this question gradually:","response":"To answer this question, first let's analyze both sentences. Sentence A: \\"Bees make honey for elephants.\\" This sentence suggests that bees produce honey specifically for the benefit of elephants. Sentence B: \\"Bees make honey for their children.\\" This sentence proposes that bees create honey to take care of their offspring. Now, let's evaluate the logic and accuracy of each statement based on facts about bees and honey production. Bees, especially honeybees, make honey by collecting nectar from flowers and storing it in their hives. The honey serves as a food source for the bees and their larvae when other food sources are scarce, such as during the winter season. Honey is produced and stored mainly for this purpose and is also on occasion harvested by humans for consumption. There is no known relationship between bees producing honey explicitly to benefit elephants. On the other hand, given the importance of honey as a food source for bees and their larvae, Sentence B is accurate in emphasizing the importance of honey production to the bees' offspring. Based on this information, it is clear that: - Sentence A: \\"Bees make honey for elephants\\" is not logical. - Sentence B: \\"Bees make honey for their children\\" is logical. Therefore, the sentence that is not logical is Sentence A: \\"Bees make honey for elephants.\\""},{"question":"What happens next?

Step-by-step justification: 1. Since people are already sitting in tubes on the river, it is safe to assume that they are participating in a leisure activity, such as floating or tubing. 2. The green tube is mentioned, but no context is given for whether it is part of the current scene or not. We need to evaluate the options that are related to the green tube and integrate it within the existing scenario. 3. Option a) seems negative, as it implies the green tube is stuck and not fully functional, which is contradictory to the overall leisure setting. 4. Option b) aligns with the current setting, where the green tube lands and the people are able to participate in the leisure activity of floating on the river. This option makes sense and maintains the tone of the scenario. 5. Option c) is again negative, as it implies an accident or misfortune for the people in the green tube. 6. Option d) simply states that the green tube is shown in the water, but this doesn't add much detail to the scenario and doesn't provide a clear connection to the ongoing activity.

People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Answer:","response":"Question: According to the article, what method is being used to study the early identification of dyslexia and reading difficulties in children?

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend had a greater chance of developing heart disease? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.","response":"Fred had a greater chance of developing heart disease due to his high cholesterol from eating junk food and fatty foods."},{"question":"I have a new situation: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. But I can use this background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: What is an answer for this question: Which case would see slower movement, case A or case C? A:","response":"To answer the question of which case would see slower movement, case A or case C, we will consider the information provided about the planets' orbits. Case A: John observed planet Mars. Case C: John observed planet Jupiter. According to the provided background information, a planet's year (sidereal period) depends on its distance from its star. The farther a planet is from its star, the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. Mars is closer to the Sun than Jupiter, as mentioned in the question. Therefore, since Jupiter is farther from the Sun than Mars, its orbital speed would be slower as it is less affected by the Sun's gravity. So, case C (planet Jupiter) would see slower movement compared to case A (planet Mars)."},{"question":"Article:The operator of the aircraft has been arrested by Capitol police.

Each case study should be relevant to its specific context in terms of time, location, and the subjects or problems being studied. 3. Methodological rigor: The definition must emphasize the importance of using a rigorous and systematic approach to collecting and analyzing data in a case study. This may include employing appropriate methods such as in-depth interviews, document analysis, or observations. 4. Triangulation: To strengthen the validity of case study findings, the definition should endorse the use of multiple sources of evidence and data collection methods. This helps to corroborate the findings and allows for a more robust understanding of the phenomenon being studied. 5. Rich, thick description: High-quality case studies should provide a detailed and contextualized account of the phenomenon being studied. Your definition should encourage researchers to use rich, thick descriptions that allow readers to fully understand the complexities of the case. 6. Transferability: A well-conducted case study should offer insights and findings that can be transferred or applied to other similar situations or contexts. Your definition should emphasize the importance of presenting findings in a manner that allows readers to draw comparisons and make connections to other cases or situations. 7. Reflexivity: The definition should highlight the importance of being reflexive throughout the case study process. Researchers should be aware of their own biases, preconceptions, and the potential influence of their presence on the study subjects and outcomes. 8. Ethical considerations: Finally, a robust case studies definition must incorporate the importance of adhering to ethical guidelines in research. This includes obtaining informed consent, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity, and protecting the well-being of participants.

On 30 May they were joined by 50,000 Left Bank Cossacks under hetman Ivan Samoilovich at the mouth of the Samora River where the Dnieper turns south. In the heat of summer, 180,000 men, 20,000 wagons and 100,000 horses set out down the east bank of the Dnieper. The huge force, which started too late and was perhaps not well organized, could only travel about 10km per day. When the Russians reached the Konskiye Vody river on the west-flowing part of the Dnieper, they found that the Tatars has set fire to the steppe . After a few days of marching over burnt land, their horses were exhausted, they were short of water and 130 miles from their goal at Perekop, however Golitsyn built a fortress at Novobogoroditskoe at the junction of the Dnieper and the Samara. On 17 June they decided to turn back. Question: How many days after a Russian army of about 132,000 soldiers led by knyaz Vasily Golitsyn left Okhtyrka did they decide to turn back? Answer:","response":"To find out how many days it took for the Russian army to decide to turn back, we need to calculate the days between leaving Okhtyrka (2 May, 1687) and deciding to turn back (17 June, 1687). To do this, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the number of days in May they were traveling: From May 2 to May 31, there are 30 days (31 - 2 + 1). 2. Calculate the number of days in June they were traveling: From June 1 to June 17, there are 17 days. 3. Add the numbers of days from both months: 30 days in May + 17 days in June = 47 days. So, the Russian army led by Knyaz Vasily Golitsyn decided to turn back 47 days after leaving Okhtyrka."},{"question":"Premise: I read last week's Committee of Advice for Dole, with some interest and not a little amazement. Hypothesis: Last week's Committee of Advice for Dole wasn't as interesting as previous editions, which was pretty disappointing as I usually look forward to reading them. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"Step 1: Understand the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: The user read last week's Committee of Advice for Dole and was amazed, but not in a positive way. Hypothesis: Last week's Committee of Advice for Dole wasn't as interesting as previous editions, causing disappointment. Step 2: Identify the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Both statements concern the user's reaction to last week's Committee of Advice for Dole. The premise conveys a sense of amazement that may not be positive, while the hypothesis asserts disappointment due to diminished interest compared to previous editions. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment occurs when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, we can consider the possibility that the user could be amazed by last week's edition for a reason unrelated to its level of interest compared to previous editions, such as being amazed by a particular event or decision included.

Article: Five years ago, when I taught art at a school in Seattle, I used Tinkertoys as a test at the beginning of a term to find out something about my students. I put a small set of Tinkertoys in front of each student, and said:\\"Make something out of the Tinkertoys. You have 45 minutes today - and 45minutes each day for the rest of the week.\\" A few students hesitated to start. They waited to see the rest of the class would do. Several others checked the instructions and made something according to one of the model plans provided. Another group built something out of their own imaginations. Once I had a boy who worked experimentally with Tinkertoys in his free time. His constructions filled a shelf in the art classroom and a good part of his bedroom at home. I was delighted at the presence of such a student. Here was an exceptionally creative mind at work. His presence meant that I had an unexpected teaching assistant in class whose creativity would infect other students. Encouraging this kind of thinking has a downside. I ran the risk of losing those students who had a different style of thinking. Without fail one would declare, \\"But I'm just not creative.\\" \\"Do you dream at night when you're asleep?\\" \\"Oh, sure.\\" \\"So tell me one of your most interesting dreams.\\" The student would tell something wildly imaginative. Flying in the sky or in a time machine or growing three heads. \\"That's pretty creative. Who does that for you?\\" \\"Nobody. I do it.\\" \\"Really-at night, when you're asleep?\\" \\"Sure.\\" \\"Try doing it in the daytime, in class, okay?\\" Question: The teacher used Tinkertoys in class in order to _ ? Options: A: know more about the students B: make the lessons more exciting C: raise the students' interest in art D: teach the students about toy design Answer:","response":"A: know more about the students In the article, Tinkertoys are used as a beginning-of-term test by the teacher to understand more about the students, their thinking styles, and their level of creativity. By using this activity, the teacher was able to observe which students followed instructions, which ones were comfortable innovating, and who hesitated to start, observing and learning about their thought processes. The information gathered from this activity most likely helped the teacher to adapt her teaching style and strategies to better suit each student's way of thinking and creativity, thus, the best option is A: \\"know more about the students.\\""},{"question":"What happens next? How to seek therapy if you are a teen Open the discussion. Often, the hardest part about opening up to your parents is starting the conversation. Take some time and decide what you want to say. 1). If your parents are not very accepting, you may have to say things like, \\" i wish you would listen to me more, but we know the last thing you want is for me to end up in jail or suspended. \\" listen to your parents' perspective of the situation, and make sure to help them with your communication.; 2). You might even want to write down your thoughts so that you can communicate them clearly. When you're ready to talk, make sure you and parent or guardian have time to talk without rushing off to something else.; 3). That doesn't mean ignoring it, it means beginning your conversation with both positive and negative statements. If you are facing your parent about your decision, ask them directly how you feel.; 4). Your phone will ring and give you two options. You can tell your parents that you want to talk.;","response":"5). Choose the right time and place. Pick a moment when your parents or guardian are relaxed and have time to engage in a longer conversation. A quiet and comfortable place, free from distractions, works best for such discussions. Avoid bringing this up during family gatherings or when they are busy with work or other concerns. This shows that you are sincere in your need for therapy, and they are more likely to give you their undivided attention. 6). Be honest and straightforward about your feelings and reasons. Clearly explain what you're experiencing, why you feel that therapy would be helpful, and any specific concerns or issues you feel need to be addressed. Providing tangible examples of situations where you have faced challenges, struggled with emotions, or felt overwhelmed can make it easier for your parents to understand your need for therapy. 7). Reassure them that seeking therapy is not a sign of weakness. Some parents may worry that your desire for therapy indicates a lack of resilience or strength. Emphasize the benefits of therapy, such as improving mental health, gaining tools to cope with life stressors, and having an impartial person to discuss issues with. This will help them to see therapy in a more positive light and better understand your decision. 8). Do your research. Be prepared with information about different types of therapy, potential costs, and therapists in your area. If you know of specific therapists or counseling centers you'd like to consider, have that information on hand to share with your parents. This demonstrates that you are proactive, informed, and committed to improving your mental health. 9). Be prepared for their questions and concerns. Your parents may have doubts or uncertainties regarding therapy. Answer their questions to the best of your ability, and be open to discussing their concerns. If you don't know the answer to a particular question, suggest researching together or offer to find the information on your own. 10). Offer solutions for any barriers they might raise. For instance, if finances or scheduling are concerns, explore options for lower-cost therapy, insurance coverage, or flexible appointment times. By acknowledging their concerns and offering possible solutions, you convey that you are committed to making therapy a reality and have considered the potential challenges. 11). Finally, be patient. Your parents may need time to process your request and think about the information you have shared. They may not immediately agree to support your decision, but giving them time and space to think can sometimes increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. Remember that initiating such conversations can be difficult, but taking the first step to seek help is crucial for your mental health and well-being. Even if your parents are initially unsure about the idea, don't get discouraged and keep the lines of communication open. They may come around and support your decision once they understand its importance to you and your well-being."},{"question":"Where is a handy place to store a steel pen in your office? Options: - car shop - desk drawer - car. - warehouse - hand Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Identify the context of the question. The question concerns finding a suitable location to store a steel pen in an office setting. Step 2: Evaluate each option based on the context. - Car shop: Not applicable since this location is not typically found within an office setting. - Desk drawer: This is a plausible location as desk drawers are common office storage spaces and can safely store pens. - Car: Not suitable because a car is outside of the office environment and would not provide convenient access to the pen when needed. - Warehouse: Not the most convenient location for office use as warehouses are primarily used for storing bulk items or equipment rather than individual pens. - Hand: Not practical for long-term storage, as pens should be safely stored to prevent loss or damage. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate option. Based on the evaluation, the best option for storing a steel pen in your office is the desk drawer, as it provides a safe and easily accessible storage space within an office setting."},{"question":"Title: good intro. to Nietzsche, and interesting to those familiar- Product review: I enjoy the two tape set very much.

The club announced the signing of Aston Villa midfielder Riccardo Calder and Doncaster goalkeeper Ross Etheridge on loan deals until the end of the season. Both players bring a wealth of experience and talent, aiming to contribute towards the team's objective of securing promotion. Riccardo Calder, a 22-year-old Jamaican midfielder, signed a professional contract with Aston Villa in 2015 after progressing through the club's youth ranks. Calder has had valuable first-team experience while on loan at various clubs in the lower divisions, including Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Doncaster Rovers. Known for his versatility, the Kingston-born midfielder is expected to give the Lincoln City manager more options in the middle of the park. Calder comes to the team with a reputation for being a talented and hardworking player, accustomed to playing in different positions across the midfield. His preferred role, however, is as a central midfielder, where he can utilize his exceptional passing ability and knowledge of the game to dictate play and set up goalscoring opportunities for his teammates. As a result of these qualities, Riccardo Calder is a valuable addition for Lincoln City as they approach the final run of fixtures in their push for promotion. Meanwhile, Ross Etheridge, a 26-year-old English goalkeeper, was signed from Doncaster Rovers on a similar deal. Etheridge began his career at Fulham before moving to Charlton Athletic. He later played for Accrington Stanley, Northampton Town, and Alfreton Town before joining Doncaster Rovers in 2016. Over the years, Etheridge has accrued substantial experience for a goalkeeper of his age and is expected to provide stiff competition for the number one spot at Lincoln City. Etheridge, who stands over 6 feet tall, is known for his shot-stopping ability, aerial prowess, and impressive reflexes. Moreover, his leadership skills and commanding presence in the box are crucial to marshaling the defense and fostering a sense of confidence among his teammates. The addition of Etheridge to the team will not only raise the standard of goalkeeping but also add much-needed depth to the position. The loan signings of both Riccardo Calder and Ross Etheridge are important developments for Lincoln City, especially at this critical stage of the season. The new recruits will inject fresh energy, experience, and quality into the side, providing the necessary impetus to fulfill their ambition of securing promotion. Moreover, the increased competition for places in the starting eleven will keep existing players on their toes, ensuring that they maintain high-performance levels. In conclusion, Lincoln City's acquisition of Riccardo Calder and Ross Etheridge on loan until the end of the season demonstrates a strategic move to bolster their squad. The signings of these talented players will give manager Danny Cowley more depth and flexibility in his team selection while sending a strong message to their opponents. With Calder and Etheridge now in the mix, the Imps will look to finish the season on a high and pursue their ultimate goal of promotion."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: turkey 's parliament on tuesday extended the government 's mandate to order military strikes against kurdish rebels holed up in neighbouring northern iraq .

Answer:","response":"Yes, both the Colorado River Aqueduct and Eastside Canal are located in the same state of California."},{"question":"Solve f = 18*f for f.. What is the answer??","response":"To solve the equation for the variable f, we have the following equation: f = 18*f We can begin by collecting like terms, which means we'll subtract f from both sides of the equation to get all instances of f on one side. This is a standard technique for solving algebraic equations. Step 1: Subtract f from both sides, 18*f - f = 0 This simplifies to 17*f = 0 The next step is division. In order to isolate f, we would need to get rid of the 17 in front of it, which entails dividing both sides by 17. Step 2: Divide both sides by 17, (17*f) / 17 = 0 / 17 Simplify to: f = 0. Step 3: Check solution. Plug f = 0 back into the original equation f = 18*f 0 = 18*0 0 = 0. The original equation holds true for f = 0. Therefore, our solution is correct: f = 0 is the solution to the equation."},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: Most graduate immunology schools follow the AAI courses immunology which are offered throughout numerous schools in the United States.

The Indian National Congress () (INC, often called Congress) is a broad-based political party in India. Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th-century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement, with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants. The Congress led India to independence from Great Britain, and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire. The Congress is a secular party whose social liberal platform is generally considered on the centre-left of Indian politics. The Congress' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya—the lifting up of all sections of society—which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people. The party primarily endorses social liberalism — seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice, and secularism — asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings. After India's independence in 1947, the Congress formed the government at center in most instances, and many regional state governments. Congress became India's dominant political party; , in the 15 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times, heading the central government for 49 years. There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947–64), and the most recent Manmohan Singh (2004–14). Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014, it remains one of two major, nationwide, political parties in India, along with the right-wing, Hindu nationalist, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

The term \\"important biomes\\" typically refers to ecologically significant habitats that support various forms of life. The best answer options relating to important biomes from the given list are: - (A) important habitats: A biome is indeed an important habitat that supports various types of plant and animal life. Each biome has specific climate conditions and native species that have adapted to that environment. - (G) Marshes, bogs, and swamps: These are examples of a specific type of biome called wetlands. Wetlands are important ecosystems that help purify water, reduce flood risks, and provide habitat for a wide variety of plants and animals. They can be found all over the world and are crucial for biodiversity and environmental health. Some other examples of important biomes not mentioned in the options include: 1. Tropical Rainforests: Found near the equator, these dense, warm, and wet forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. Tropical rainforests also play a critical role in regulating the planet's climate and generating oxygen. 2. Deserts: Characterized by their arid climate, deserts cover about one-fifth of the Earth's land surface and have unique plant and animal life adapted to survive in extremely dry conditions. 3. Grasslands (Savannas and Prairies): These wide-open areas are dominated by various grass species and support many grazing herbivores and their predators. Grasslands play an important role in supporting agricultural systems too. 4. Tundra: Located in the far northern regions of the Earth, the tundra is characterized by freezing temperatures and often treeless landscapes. Despite the harsh climate, the tundra supports a unique variety of plant and animal life adapted to survive in extreme conditions. 5. Temperate Forests: Found in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, temperate forests support a vast diversity of plant and animal life and function as critical carbon sinks by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis."},{"question":"Dave Dennis (born 20 January 1986 in Sydney) is a national representative rugby union footballer who plays professionally for the Exeter Chiefs He was educated at Richmond High School in Sydney, when he played in the Australian Schoolboys Rugby team in 2004.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"The perturbation in question is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand how a temperature drop affects the process of snowflake formation when the air is warmer, we must first understand the individual steps of the process and the role temperature plays in each: 1. Water in the clouds becomes very cold: Atmospheric temperature plays a crucial role in determining whether water in the clouds turns into ice crystals. If the temperature is below 32°F (0°C), the water is more likely to freeze and form ice crystals. If the air is warmer, the process may still occur, but it would require the presence of supercooled water droplets, which remain in a liquid state at temperatures below freezing until they come into contact with an ice crystal or other nuclei. 2. The cold water forms ice crystals: The formation of ice crystals is highly dependent on temperature. If the temperature is lower, ice crystals will form more easily. However, in a warmer atmosphere, they may need to find a surface to nucleate upon, such as a dust particle or another ice crystal. 3. The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets: Temperature affects the rate at which ice crystals grow. When the temperature drops, ice crystals can grow more rapidly as they absorb the supercooled water droplets. Conversely, warmer temperatures may slow down this process, as the melting of ice crystals becomes more prevalent. 4. Form snowflakes: As the ice crystals grow and merge, snowflakes start forming. Snowflakes usually form when the air temperature hovers around the freezing point. However, warmer air temperatures may result in the partial melting of snowflakes, causing them to become less symmetrical or potentially not forming snowflakes at all. 5. The snowflakes fall to the ground: When snowflakes become heavy enough, they fall to the ground due to gravity. The rate at which they fall can be influenced by the air temperature, as well. Warmer air temperatures could lead to snowflakes melting partially or entirely before reaching the ground, turning into rain or a mix of snow and rain. In the given scenario, the temperature drop is causing the air to be warmer than normal. This temperature change indirectly impacts several steps of the snowflake formation process. It could make it more challenging for ice crystals to form, slow down their growth, cause partial melting of snowflakes, and even influence whether the snow reaches the ground as snow or rain. The indirect impact occurs because the initial temperature drop has made the air warmer, and it's this warmer air that then impacts the various stages of the process."},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: French President Nicolas Sarkozy spends night in hospital after collapsing.

The incident took place near his weekend home, where the 54-year-old president was running through woodlands when he suddenly fainted. He was quickly taken to a hospital by his security team, prompting concerns for his health and national security, but the French minister has assured that the president is in good shape and will be discharged today. Upon examination, doctors have diagnosed President Sarkozy with a \\"minor\\" nervous condition that caused his blood pressure to drop. The French minister, in a statement to the media, has confirmed the news, \\"The news from the doctors is good.

Known for his active lifestyle and fitness levels, President Sarkozy has often been seen jogging and cycling in public, promoting a healthy lifestyle among his fellow countrymen. His collapse on Sunday could raise questions about his health and some may argue that the pressures of the presidency might be taking a toll on him. However, this incident is also a reminder that even the fittest of individuals may not be immune to sudden health issues. Given the importance of the French presidency and the influence France holds in the European community, any health-related issue of the president raises concerns of national security and stability. But reassurances from French authorities suggest that this incident is not expected to cause any disruptions to the country's governance in the coming days. As the president continues his convalescence, it remains prudent to be vigilant against any potential changes in his condition. Nevertheless, President Sarkozy's collapse serves as a cautionary tale for all to maintain a balance between personal health, public obligations, and mental wellbeing. It also highlights the importance of regular medical check-ups and being attuned to one's body, especially for those in positions of immense power and responsibility. It is our hope that President Sarkozy will make a full recovery and continue to promote the message of living a healthy and active lifestyle. In conclusion, French President Nicolas Sarkozy's collapse and subsequent hospitalization showcases the potential vulnerability of even the most powerful individuals. As the president embarks on his recovery journey, the French nation breathes a sigh of relief, knowing that this incident has not resulted in any severe repercussions for the country's stability and governance.

The former News of the World editor said she had been ‘vindicated’ after suffering ‘a maelstrom of controversy, of politics and of comment’. The 46-year-old insisted she was ‘incredibly proud’ of her campaigns as editor at the Sunday tabloid but appeared to acknowledge the pain caused to those whose phones were hacked by journalists, and that mistakes had been made. Scroll down for video. 'I am innocent': Rebekah Brooks, pictured with husband Charlie, has spoken for the first time after she was cleared of hacking charges at the Old Bailey. Speaking out: The former News International chief executive addressed reporters outside her London home. Ordeal: Surrounded by a media scrum outside the house, Mrs Brooks said the last three years had been 'tough' for her, her husband and those close to them. Support: Mr Brooks today paid tribute to the 'dignity' his wife had shown throughout a three-year 'witch-hunt' ‘I am innocent of the crimes that I was charged with and I feel vindicated by the unanimous verdicts,’ she said. ‘The. last few years have been tough for both of us and those closest to us,. but more importantly they have been tough for everybody, on all sides. that have been affected by the issues raised by this case.’ Asked. if she could have done more to prevent phone hacking at the News of the. World, Mrs Brooks told journalists: ‘It’s been a time of reflection for. me. I’ve learned some valuable lessons and will hopefully become the. wiser for it.’ Response: Mrs Brooks, 46, made no direct reference to Andy Coulson as she faced a barrage of questions from reporters. 'Vindicated': Mrs Brooks said she was innocent of all the crimes she was charged with, and felt 'vindicated' by the jury's unanimous verdicts. Perspective: Mrs Brooks said the trial had made her grateful for her 'happy and healthy' daughter, and the support of her mother. Grateful: Mrs Brooks said she was grateful to the jury following their decision to clear her of all charges. It was. the first time Mrs Brooks and her husband Charlie, 51, had spoken. publicly about the hacking scandal since they were charged in May 2012. Back. then Mrs Brooks condemned her prosecution as ‘nothing more than an. expensive sideshow, a waste of public money as a result of an unjust and. weak decision’, and her husband said she was ‘the subject of a. witch-hunt’. Yesterday Mr. Brooks said he stood by his comments, saying: ‘Everything, absolutely. everything we said, has been proved to be true. ‘Rebekah. has been through an unprecedented investigation of an incredibly. forensic and personal nature, the likes of which we have probably never. seen. ‘And I would just like to say how proud I am of Rebekah and the dignity she has shown.’ Asked if he still believed the prosecution was a witch-hunt, he nodded emphatically and replied: ‘Yes. Unity: The couple both spoke for the first time since the end of the hacking trial, which saw them and three others unanimously cleared of hacking charges. Andy Coulson was found guilty. Mrs Brooks was wearing a £180 'Edie' dress from Boutique by Jaeger, and carrying a £475 'Robinson' by Tory Burch tote-style bag. Tough: Mrs Brooks' voice broke and she appeared to be close to tears as she gave the statement. She would not be drawn on Mr Coulson's fate or whether she should have done more to deal with criminality at the News of the World. Mr. and Mrs Brooks spoke as they left the £5million townhouse in. Clerkenwell, central London, which they had rented for the duration of. the eight-month trial so that they would be close to the Old Bailey. A. tired-looking Mrs Brooks said they were desperate ‘to spend some. much-needed time with Scarlett’, their two-year-old daughter. Scarlett. was born in January 2012, just weeks before the couple were arrested. Their. trial heard how Mrs Brooks had been unable to conceive, despite. fertility treatment, and Scarlett was born after a cousin agreed to a. surrogate pregnancy. She. ignored questions about how she felt about the conviction of her former. deputy editor and lover Andy Coulson, the only person found guilty at. the trial. Coulson, 46, who. later became Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of communications. in Downing Street, faces prison when he is sentenced next week alongside. three former News of the World news editors and private detective Glenn. Mulcaire. Mr Brooks said he was ‘very sad’ for Coulson, his wife and their three young sons. He said they had not heard from Mr Cameron – with whom they were close friends before the trial – since Tuesday’s acquittal. Time of reflection: Mrs Brooks told the waiting reporters that she had 'learned some valuable lessons', and hopefully was 'the wiser for it' Mixed emotions: At times Mrs Brooks smiled and at others she was close to tears, and said she would spend her time supporting her colleagues still on trial but would not be drawn on her own career going forward. Tribute: Mr Brooks, said he was already back working full time as a horse trainer, said his wife went 'through an unprecedented investigation of an incredibly forensic and personal nature, the likes of which we have probably never seen' Back home: The couple said they were heading back to Oxfordshire to spend more time with their daughter. Mrs. Brooks – who wore a £180 butterfly print Jaeger dress and carried a. £475 Tony Burch ‘Robinson’ stripe tote bag – refused to answer any. questions about her plans for the future. She. is known to have received payouts totalling £16million following her. resignation as chief executive at News International, although that was. understood to include the legal fees for her defence. She appeared to have memorised a lengthy statement and stared straight. ahead as she spoke, although her legs were visibly shaking. Asked. about the journalists still facing trial whom she worked with at the. News of the World and The Sun, she said: ‘I am incredibly proud of the. many journalists I have worked with throughout my career and the great. campaigns that we have fought and won. ‘All I can say to you all is that today my thoughts are with my former colleagues and their families who face future trials. I am going to do everything I can to support them as I know how anxious the times ahead are.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Rebekah Brooks is a lady who used to work as an editor for a newspaper called News of the World.

The weakness of the span was overlooked until it collapsed. His weakness increased as he became older.","response":"No, the word \\"weakness\\" does not have the same definition in the given sentences. Although the word \\"weakness\\" conveys a general sense of being less strong or less capable in both examples, the context in which it is used provides specific, distinct meanings in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"The weakness of the span was overlooked until it collapsed,\\" the word \\"weakness\\" refers to the structural deficiency or lack of stability in a physical object, in this case, the \\"span.\\" A span could be a bridge, an arch, or any other construction element that spans a gap or space. In this context, the weakness refers to an inadequacy in the materials, design, or construction of the span that led to its eventual failure and collapse. This weakness could be due to faulty engineering, poor materials, or damage sustained over time. In the second sentence, \\"His weakness increased as he became older,\\" the word \\"weakness\\" refers to a loss or reduction in one's physical strength, endurance, or overall health. This type of weakness typically affects people as they age, due to factors such as the natural aging process, muscle atrophy, or a decline in overall health and fitness. Here, the weakness is of a personal and biological nature, as opposed to the structural and engineering-oriented weakness mentioned in the first sentence. Even though both sentences use the word \\"weakness\\" to convey a sense of vulnerability or failing, the respective contexts within each sentence give the word distinct meanings related to the specific subject in question. In the first case, it is the structural aspect of a physical object, while in the second case, it is the personal, physical aspect of an individual's health and well-being that is being referred to."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: AIP Advances EDITOR A.T.

Answer:","response":"The Twenty-third Amendment refers to the amendment made to the United States Constitution that granted the District of Columbia the right to participate in the Electoral College system and allocated the District with three electors. Although this amendment is related to the electoral college, it does not specifically answer the question about when the electoral college votes. To answer your question about validating the suggested answer, it is important to understand the context of the question it addresses. The original question you provided is asking for the timeline or event during which the electoral college casts their votes. The suggested answer, however, provides information about the result of the Twenty-third Amendment in the context of the District of Columbia and its electors. While the suggested answer offers relevant information about the electoral college system and the District of Columbia's role in it, it does not precisely address the specific question asked. To provide a correct answer: The electoral college votes typically occur in mid-December, after each individual U.S. state conducts its general election in November. The electors from each state gather in their respective state capitals to cast their votes for the President and the Vice President in separate ballots. The exact date varies depending on the election year, as it is determined by the provisions stated in the U.S. Code - Title 3, Section 7, which sets the meeting for the electors on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. For instance, during the 2020 election, the electoral college votes took place on December 14th, 2020.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","response":"If fewer people recycle, it would indirectly impact the recycling process. Although the process itself remains unchanged, the volume of recyclable materials entering the process will be greatly reduced. As a result, the effectiveness and efficiency of recycling programs and centers would be affected. The following are some consequences of this indirect impact: 1. Reduced resource availability: As fewer materials are recycled, there will be a limited supply of recycled materials for manufacturers to use in their production processes. This might cause manufacturers to rely more heavily on new or virgin materials, which could lead to the depletion of natural resources and increased environmental degradation. 2. Higher costs: Recycling centers rely on economies of scale, which means they become more cost-effective when processing larger volumes of materials. With fewer recyclables, the cost per unit of material processed will rise, which can make recycling less financially viable and potentially lead to closures of recycling centers. 3. Wasted potential: When fewer people recycle, the potential for turning waste materials into valuable resources is not fully realized. This means that more waste is sent to landfills or incinerated, contributing to pollution and the release of greenhouse gases. 4. Lower demand for recycled material: With less material available, there may be a decrease in demand for recycled materials, forcing manufacturers who work with recycled products to either find alternative materials, modify their production processes, or lower their output. This can affect industries that depend on recycled materials and result in job losses. 5. Limited innovation: Recycling helps drive innovation, as companies and inventors devise new ways to repurpose and reuse materials. With less recycling taking place, the incentive to develop and implement innovative recycling technologies may be diminished. In conclusion, if fewer people recycle, it will indirectly impact the recycling process by affecting the availability of recycled materials, increasing costs, reducing efficiency, and having negative environmental and economic consequences. Encouraging more people to recycle is crucial in order to reap the full benefits of the recycling process and contribute to a more sustainable future."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: Johnny James Simmons, is an American actor, and is known for his role as who, in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a 2012 American coming-of-age drama film?

Can we draw the following conclusion? Plants in soil are more nutritious Available options: +Yes. +It's impossible to say. +No.","response":"It's impossible to say definitively that plants grown in soil are more nutritious across the board, as various factors can influence the nutritional value of a plant, regardless of the growing medium. In order to adequately address this question, let us explore some of the alternative methods of growing plants and the factors that may affect their nutrition levels. Alternative to soil-based cultivation, hydroponics is a popular method that involves growing plants in nutrient-filled water without the use of soil. In this system, plant roots are supported by an inert medium like perlite or coconut coir, and they are exposed to essential nutrients dissolved in water. There are several other methods closely related to hydroponics, such as aeroponics (where plant roots are suspended in air and misted with nutrients) and aquaponics (plants are grown using water from fish tanks, which is rich in organic nutrients). Each of these methods offers unique advantages and some limitations as well, but all allow for plant growth without soil. The nutritional value of plants is determined by various factors, including the type of growing medium (soil or hydroponic), nutrient availability, environmental conditions (light, temperature, and humidity), and the specific plant species being grown. One of the major advantages of hydroponics and its related methods is the ability to precisely control nutrient levels, environmental conditions, and other aspects of plant growth. This can lead to increased yields and potentially more nutritious plants. Some studies have shown that hydroponically grown plants can possess higher levels of certain nutrients compared to their soil-grown counterparts, although results may vary based on the specific plant species and nutrient being assessed. On the other hand, soil-based cultivation has the natural benefit of a diverse microbial community that supports plant health and nutrient uptake. Moreover, soil contains trace minerals and organic matter that may contribute to the overall nutritional value of plants. However, soil-grown plants are more susceptible to diseases, pests, and fluctuating external conditions, which could impact the quality and nutritional content of the plants. In summary, it's impossible to say whether plants grown in soil are more nutritious than those grown using alternative methods such as hydroponics, aeroponics, or aquaponics. The nutritional value of plants depends on numerous factors, and while some studies have found differences in nutrient content between soil-grown and hydroponic plants, these results are not consistent across all plant species and nutrient types. As a result, it's essential to consider the specific growing conditions and practices being employed, as well as the type of plant being grown, when evaluating the nutritional value of plants grown in different media."},{"question":"Marcus wants to buy a new pair of shoes.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"In order to determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it is essential to first understand the meaning of both the given premise and the hypothesis. Entailment is a concept in logic and language where the truth of one statement or proposition necessarily follows from the truth of another. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. Premise: \\"yeah i can't afford to go to them\\" This premise implies that the speaker does not have sufficient financial means or resources to attend a certain event or to participate in a specific activity. The statement indicates a limitation for the speaker due to financial constraints. Hypothesis: \\"I have more than enough to pay for the event.\\" The hypothesis asserts that the speaker has ample financial resources to cover the expenses associated with attending or participating in a particular event or activity. This statement suggests a level of financial comfort or capability that exceeds the requirements of the event in question. Given the understanding of both the premise and hypothesis, it becomes apparent that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. Quite the contrary, the two statements represent opposing scenarios. The premise conveys an inability to afford or pay for the event, while the hypothesis suggests an abundance of financial resources for the same event. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"I have more than enough to pay for the event\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"yeah i can't afford to go to them\\" as the two statements present contradictory situations. If the premise is true, the hypothesis cannot be true, thereby negating the concept of entailment between these two propositions."},{"question":"Leo: If \\"A man laying on the ground with his arm under a car white a little boy is watching him.\\" does that mean that \\"A man repairing a car in his garage while his song watches him.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Mei: OK, So, let's think first... Me:","response":"It is not possible to tell. To justify this answer, let's break down the information given in both sentences: 1. In the first sentence, \\"A man laying on the ground with his arm under a car while a little boy is watching him,\\" we gather that there is a man on the ground with his arm under a car, and a little boy is observing the situation. However, the sentence does not specify whether the man is repairing the car or not. He could be doing something entirely different, like retrieving a lost item. 2. In the second sentence, \\"A man repairing a car in his garage while his son watches him,\\" the situation is clearer. The man is explicitly repairing a car, and his son is watching him. Additionally, this scenario takes place in a garage. From analyzing these two sentences, we cannot definitively determine whether they describe the same situation. The first sentence lacks the necessary information, and the second sentence contains additional details that may or may not match the first statement. So, it is not possible to tell if they are the same scenario."},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: A Must Read!

Options: - pet - rude - tropical forest - sun itself - tree Reasoning process:","response":"To determine the most plausible answer, let's analyze each option and consider the context given: the snake was very cold inside its cage. Option 1: Pet A snake cannot pet things as it doesn't have body parts capable of that action, like hands or paws. This option is not relevant to the snake's cold situation. Option 2: Rude Being rude is related to disrespectful behavior or attitude, which is irrelevant to the situation of the snake being cold. Option 3: Tropical Forest The options don't indicate possible animal behavior, but a tropical forest is a warm environment. This could be a reasonable thought as a proper temperature for a snake, but it doesn't describe what the snake would do when it's cold. Option 4: Sun itself When an animal, such as a snake, feels cold, it seeks warmth to regulate its body temperature. Basking in the sun is a natural behavior many cold-blooded animals like snakes use to warm up. They absorb heat from the sun's rays. So, if a snake is cold, it would look for a warm spot, like exposing itself to the sun. Option 5: Tree Climbing a tree doesn't answer the issue of the snake being cold, and not all snakes seek trees for comfort or protection. Based on the reasoning process, the most plausible action for a cold snake at the first opportunity is to \\"sun itself\\" to warm up."},{"question":"Q: Where are the seeds in gymnosperms found?

His 14,000-strong land and naval forces sacked Prome on 13 July 1608 after a bloody siege of eight months. His 12,000-strong forces then attacked Toungoo, then ruled by his cousin, Natshinnaung, in August 1610. After a siege of 23 days, Natshinnaung agreed to become a vassal on 4 September 1610. But Natshinnaung was deeply unhappy with his reduced status, and secretly invited de Brito of Syriam to attack Toungoo. In July 1612, Syriam and Martaban forces ransacked the city for ten days, and left, taking Natshinnaung to Syriam. In response, Anaukpetlun's army of 13,000 left Ava for Syriam on 26 December 1612. A flotilla of 80 war boats and 30 cargo boats was also sent down the Irrawaddy to blockade the port. The Burmese forces overcame Portuguese outer defences, and finally blockaded the port on 24 February 1613. But Portuguese gunners and musketeers kept the Burmese at bay for 34 days while waiting for reinforcements from Goa to arrive. On 29 March 1613, however, the Burmese successfully brought down a section of the walls, from their tunnels below. The city was sacked. On 7 April 1613, de Brito his son and Natshinnaung were all executed by impalement. A month later, on 14 May 1613, Binnya Dala of Martaban, submitted. The ruler was nominally tributary to Siam but had ruled the region like a sovereign since the death of Naresuan in 1605. Alarmed, the Siamese sent an army to Ye, south of Martaban, to prevent the Burmese from marching down the coast. But the Siamese did not try to retake Martaban.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Conoclinium coelestinum cures cancer.\\"?","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph above, we cannot conclude that Conoclinium coelestinum, or the blue mistflower, cures cancer. The paragraph primarily discusses the classification and reclassification of the plant within botanical taxonomy, focusing on its move from the genus Eupatorium to Conoclinium. There is no mention of any medicinal properties, uses, or research related to the blue mistflower's potential role in cancer treatment or cure. To determine whether Conoclinium coelestinum plays a role in curing cancer, it is necessary to refer to scientific research and clinical studies that evaluate the potential medicinal properties and applications of the plant. In such research, the plant's chemical constituents, potential interactions with human cells, and any observed therapeutic effects would be investigated and documented. Only with solid evidence from reputable sources can any claims about a plant's ability to cure cancer be substantiated. It's worth noting that many plants are being studied for their potential roles in medicine, including cancer treatment and prevention. The field of ethnopharmacology is dedicated to understanding the traditional uses of plants and their potential pharmacological properties, and this research may reveal valuable information about the medicinal properties of various plant species.

She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two.

The group claimed to have knocked the Xbox and PlayStation gaming networks offline over Christmas. Soon after, it set up a website that let anyone who paid use its software to deluge other sites with data. The attack that exposed the customer list is one of several aimed at the group and its tools. Investigative journalist Brian Krebs broke the news that the database behind the Lizard Stresser tool had been compromised. The Stresser let those who paid use it to overwhelm websites or kick people offline by bombarding the sites they were using with data. Mr Krebs did not name who got at the data but said he had acquired a dump of the entire roster of 14,241 people who signed up. Anyone visiting the Stresser site was warned about the attack by text on the main page's login box which urged people to change the password they created when they registered. In a blogpost, Mr Krebs said the Lizard Squad had not taken many precautions to protect the login and contact information surrendered by users. \\"All registered usernames and passwords were stored in plain text,\\" said Mr Krebs, adding that only a few hundred of those who signed up had paid to use it. Tech news site Ars Technica also got hold of the database dump which was briefly posted on the Mega file-sharing system. It said most of those who used it were gamers keen to stop rivals playing a particular game. Minecraft servers were a favourite target of the Stresser users, it said. Ars Technica said the dump of the database could spell problems for anyone who had used it because the IP addresses of many of them were poorly obscured and could, with a little work, be recovered. The plundering of the database comes soon after other computer experts took apart the tools that Lizard Squad has been using. One exposed the source code of a program used to attack people on IRC chat networks, In addition, soon after the Stresser site was created, computer science student Eric Zhang managed to enumerate the names of all the people who had signed up using a very simple script. \\"That took just 10 minutes to do,\\" he said. He said he was not surprised that the entire database was plundered because when he looked at the site, public access to the server behind it had not been closed off. \\"If you look at the site it's clearly run by someone who does not have much formal experience in software engineering,\\" he said. \\"Most of what they are doing is not really impressive,\\" he said. \\"Anyone can do it. All it takes is time.\\" Mr Krebs said Lizard Squad was being targeted by security professionals irked by their sudden notoriety. He said: \\"There seems to be a general sense in the security research community that these guys are in way over their heads, and that if we can't bring to justice a bunch of teenagers in Western nations who are rubbing it in everyone's faces, then that's a sad state of affairs.\\" However, he added, the time it took to carry out investigations and find members of the group had helped it survive.

Instead get the original. The theme is still valid. Don't let to much power into a machine. And the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling.","response":"The sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment by stating that the movie is a failed attempt at being a sequel, as it destroys the original plot. The reviewer also mentions having low expectations for the movie, but still ends up considering the time spent watching it as a waste. The lack of suspense, poor acting, and numerous technical errors are highlighted as major shortcomings of the movie. The reviewer particularly points out their disbelief in the technical aspects since they identify as a computer geek. They also criticize the movie for trying to combine elements from other genres (war movies and 24 hours) without success. In conclusion, the reviewer strongly advises against watching the movie, suggesting that it is a complete waste of time and not even worthy of being a low-budget TV movie. They recommend watching the original movie instead, praising its themes, acting, and plot as more exciting and compelling."},{"question":"How do I get over a break up?

Article: It's time you started eating sensibly. Experts at the first Chinese Students Nutrition and Health Festival in Kunming last week listed eight bad eating habits. *Watching television while having meals or snacks. Doing this means you don't pay attention to your food, forget how full you are, and so overeat. It can also cause digestion diseases. One way to avoid this is only to eat in certain areas of your home. * Replacing meals with snacks. Many students think that eating small snacks can help them diet. But it often results in overeating and health problems related to a lack of vegetables, carbohydrates ,proteins and vitamins. Snacking only works if it is well planned and includes healthy foods such as nuts, vegetables, fruit and yogurt. *Having drinks rather than water. Fizzy drinks and fruit juice are usually high in calories and sugar, which can cause weight problems. Water is important in making your brain cells and every organ in your body work properly. For your body to burn fat, it needs at least eight glasses of pure water a day. Liquids like soda and coffee actually take water away from your body. *Refusing to drink milk. Milk is the best natural food--it provides you with protein, which makes your bones strong and teeth healthy. * Choosing meat and certain vegetables over others. Different foods provide different kinds of nutrition. If you don't have a balanced diet, this can result in malnutrition and a weaker body. *Eating in front of the computer and staying there after meals. Take a walk after eating and it helps your stomach digest the meal. *Buying from roadside snack bars. If you shop at these places, be careful--many are not clean enough. * Eating throat tablets as if they were sweets. If you eat throat tablets when you have no throat disease, they may affect the bacteria in your mouth and cause real throat problems. Question: _ can possibly cause digestion problem.

Imran Khan Niazi PP, HI (Urdu: \`mrn Hmd khn nyzy) (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician, former first-class cricketer and philanthropist who leads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and serves as a member of the National Assembly. Prior to entering politics, Khan played international cricket for two decades in the late twentieth century. Khan was born to a Pashtun family in Lahore, Punjab, in 1952 and educated at Aitchison, Worcester, and later at Keble College, Oxford. At the height of his career, in 1982, the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad. As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, out of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the rest of 26 were drawn. He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie. In the team's second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's. Khan's first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981-1982. He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat. Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95. By the end of this series in 1982-1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain. This same Test series against India, however, also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years. An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 and he made a successful comeback to international cricket in the latter part of the 1984-1985 season. In India in 1987, Khan led Pakistan in its first-ever Test series win and this was followed by Pakistan's first series victory in England during the same year. During the 1980s, his team also recorded three creditable draws against the West Indies. India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 World Cup, but neither ventured beyond the semi-finals. Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. In 1988, he was asked to return to the captaincy by the president of Pakistan, General Zia-Ul-Haq, and on 18 January, he announced his decision to rejoin the team. Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan to another winning tour in the West Indies, which he has recounted as \\"the last time I really bowled well\\". He was declared Man of the Series against West Indies in 1988 when he took 23 wickets in 3 Tests. Khan's career-high as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Playing with a brittle batting line-up, Khan promoted himself as a batsman to play in the top order along with Javed Miandad, but his contribution as a bowler was minimal. At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself.

When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. Context: Richard's Council of the North, described as his \\"one major institutional innovation\\", derived from his ducal council following his own viceregal appointment by Edward IV; when Richard himself became king, he maintained the same conciliar structure in his absence. It officially became part of the royal council machinery under the presidency of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in April 1484, based at Sandal Castle in Wakefield. It is considered to have greatly improved conditions for northern England, as it was, in theory at least, intended to keep the peace and punish law breakers, as well as resolving land disputes. Bringing regional governance directly under the control of central government, it has been described as the king's \\"most enduring monument\\", surviving unchanged until 1641. In December 1483, Richard instituted what later became known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal representation could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts. Richard's death at Bosworth resulted in the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England since the succession of Henry II in 1154. The last legitimate male Plantagenet, Richard's nephew, Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of Richard III's brother Clarence), was executed by Henry VII in 1499. The only extant direct male line of Plantagenets is the House of Beaufort, headed today by Henry Somerset, 12th Duke of Beaufort. But the Beaufort line was barred from the succession by Henry IV. Question: Was the Court of Requests a success?. Whats the answer?","response":"The Court of Requests was largely considered a success during its time. Established by King Richard III in December 1483, it aimed to provide a legal platform for the poor who could not afford legal representation. The court's primary function was to hear and resolve the grievances of the common people without the burden of legal fees, making it a significant innovation in the sphere of social justice and the judicial system during the 15th century. One of the main factors contributing to the court's success was its alternative approach to the traditional legal system. At the time, litigation costs were high, and the judicial process could be complex and intimidating for the ordinary population. The Court of Requests simplified this process and eliminated the financial barriers often associated with legal action, thus empowering the lower social classes to access the justice system. In doing so, it gained a positive reputation as a notable means of providing legal redress to those in need. The Court of Requests continued to operate well beyond Richard III's reign, further attesting to its success. Throughout the Tudor period, the court retained its focus on providing justice to the underprivileged. Under the reign of Henry VIII, the Court of Requests expanded its jurisdiction and gained additional authority to enforce decisions, which further enhanced its effectiveness in addressing grievances. However, it is important to acknowledge that the court also faced criticism and challenges during its existence. Some detractors argued that the informal nature of the court could lead to inconsistent decision-making or the possibility of bias by the officials responsible for presiding over cases. Additionally, the court often had to compete with other legal institutions, which, in some instances, caused confusion or overlapping jurisdictions. Despite these challenges, the overall legacy of the Court of Requests is largely positive. It demonstrated a recognition of the importance of an accessible and affordable justice system for all citizens, regardless of their social status or financial means. This commitment to social justice contributed to the long-lasting influence of the court, which continued to function in varying capacities until its abolition during the English Civil War in 1641. Thus, although the Court of Requests was not without flaws, its accomplishments in offering an accessible justice system for the poor reveal it to be a success in many respects."},{"question":"Cele 250 de milioane de euro alocate consolidării instituţionale se vor axa mai ales asupra dezvoltării societăţii civile, a protecţiei sârbilor şi a altor minorităţi şi a întăririi legii de drept.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Sullana Province is a landlocked province in the Piura Region in northwestern Peru. It is the northernmost province in the Piura Region. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Manuel Arturo Odría Amoretti (November 26, 1896 February 18, 1974) was the President of Peru from 1948 to 1956, essentially ruling as a military dictator. - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments.

It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. - Miguel Checa District is one of eight districts of the province Sullana in Peru . It was created by law on 10 November 1950 by the government of President Manuel A. Odría . The administrative center of the district is the village of Sojo which is approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) west of the town of Sullana on the Paita Highway . Of interest in Miguel Checa District are the archaeological site and huaca \`\` La Mariposa '' , and the colonial mansion \`\` Casa de Sojo '' . The district was named after Miguel Checa who built the \`\` Casa de Sojo '' in 1910 . - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about .

Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland. - The Amazon River (or ; Spanish and ) in South America is the largest river by discharge of water in the world, and according to some experts, the longest in length. The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazons most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the Mantaro River in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac confluence, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn confluences with the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters at Manaus, the river's largest city.

Follow her on Twitter. President Obama: Twenty-seven people are dead, 20 of them children, and you just told the nation that we’re all going to have to “extend a hand to those in need.”* “We’ve endured too many of these tragedies,” you rightly noted, clearly moved by the particular horrendousness of what took place in Connecticut today. And then, holding back your tears, you said this: I react to news like this, “not as a president, but as a parent.” Advertisement God, that is unbelievably wrong. React as a president. Get Slate in your inbox. Earlier today, your press secretary, Jay Carney, speaking for you, said that today is not the day to talk about gun control. “There is, I am sure, will be, rather, a day for discussion of the usual Washington policy debates, but I do not think today is that day.” Right, right, today’s not the day because we wouldn’t want to politicize a tragedy. That might make you look crass. And more important than stopping future elementary school students from being shot in the face and head and chest and little legs is for you to show a little tact by rising above your unseemly urge to make this country better. Also, you don’t want to offend anyone directly involved in the shooting. Like the parents of the kids who were murdered this morning while learning basic addition and how to write their ABCs. I’m sure they just want you to stay out of it for the day—keep it to yourself, will ya? Because no one likes a president who would immediately and decisively stand up to stop something like this from happening again. That’s just too political, and you are a statesman. Plus, the benefit of not “capitalizing” on the tragedy is that, in a few days, most of us will put this whole thing behind us. We have Christmas presents to buy and trees to decorate—this is a very busy time of year! So if you wait this one out, just kind of do the bare minimum of your job, our outrage will probably pass, and you can avoid any of those “usual Washington policy debates.” Those are such a yawn, amirite? Advertisement History is on your side. Just this week there was a shooting in a Portland, Ore., mall—did you hear about it? It’s receded in my mind, too. Remember Aurora? Yes, the one with Batman in it! You were running for your second term when that horrific mass shooting happened, so it was definitely not the time to do anything constructive. And then there was another one in Wisconsin—details are hazy in my mind because after a while these rampages all run together. Carney had you covered then, too: The White House on Monday all but ruled out the possibility that President Barack Obama would make a push for new gun control laws in the aftermath of the shooting rampage in Oak Creek, Wis. Press secretary Jay Carney noted that Obama had called for better enforcement of existing laws in the wake of the massacre at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater last month. \\"I have nothing new to announce,\\" Carney said at his daily briefing. In fact, you ended up winning the election with barely a mention of gun control and got to trot out Gabrielle Giffords in a moving moment at your Democratic convention, so that worked out. I don’t know what you plan to do after your presidency, but unless you are hoping to replace Wayne LaPierre, you are probably safe to go out on a limb here today. Bill Clinton was a lame-duck president at the time of Columbine, but he pushed for tougher regulations and politicized the hell out of that school shooting. Still, that guy was never known for his political skill, so I see your point. Anyway, I know you have a very busy schedule and are really looking forward to kicking back for the weekend and hugging your kids a little tighter before bed tonight. TGIF. But could you just let us all know: When would be a better day? ||||| Several Democratic lawmakers, as well as gun control advocates, said that Friday's fatal shootings at a Connecticut elementary school should move the president and Congress to swiftly address the issue of gun violence in America. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) called on President Obama and Congress to have a \\"serious discussion about gun control\\" in response to the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Nadler's statement came as details continued to emerge about the shooting. According to Connecticut State Police have reported that 20 children and 7 adults, including the shooter, have lost their lives. The alleged shooter, Adam Lanza, 24, of Hoboken, New Jersey, killed his father in Hoboken before driving to the Connecticut school, where he killed his mother, a teacher at the school, and the other adults and children, according to multiple media reports. ADVERTISEMENT \\"I am absolutely horrified by news of the cold-blooded shooting of dozens of children in Newtown, Conn.,\\" Nadler said in a statement on Friday. \\"Yet another unstable person has gotten access to firearms and committed an unspeakable crime against innocent children. We cannot simply accept this as a routine product of modern American life.\\"If now is not the time to have a serious discussion about gun control and the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our society, I don’t know when is. How many more Columbines and Newtowns must we live through? I am challenging President Obama, the Congress, and the American public to act on our outrage and, finally, do something about this.\\"Another New York Democrat, Rep. Nita Lowey, called the shooting \\"senseless and heartbreaking\\" and said there needed to be \\"concrete action\\" to prevent further gun violence. \\"We cannot tolerate mass shootings as a mere inconvenience or a normal part of our everyday lives,\\" Lowey said. \\"Easy availability of the deadliest weapons to the most dangerous people has cost countless lives and caused immeasurable suffering, never more so than today.

I agree, now is not the time to talk about gun laws – the time for that conversation was long before all those kids in Connecticut died today.\\" Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added his voice to those calling for action to address gun violence. \\"Today is a day for mourning and prayer, but we must immediately get to work to end these senseless, mass killings of innocent Americans. Together, we must act now to stop the carnage,” Van Hollen said in a release. At a press conference, President Obama said meaningful action should be taken to prevent future shooting tragedies. The president said \\"it is time to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,\\" an indication that Obama could be prepared to confront gun control. Responding to Obama's press conference, Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said his organization was encouraged by Obama's comments. \\"We were moved by President Obama's raw emotion during his remarks today,\\" Gross said. \\"We are committed to working with him to channel it into the change that is too long overdue.\\" In 2010 the Brady campaign gave Obama a failing grade on pushing for stricter gun laws. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) responded that Obama needs to do more than call for action. \\"Calling for �?meaningful action’ is not enough. We need immediate action. We have heard all the rhetoric before,\\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \\"What we have not seen is leadership – not from the White House and not from Congress. That must end today. This is a national tragedy and it demands a national response. My deepest sympathies are with the families of all those affected, and my determination to stop this madness is stronger than ever.\\" Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), who introduced legislation to ban high-capacity magazine clips in automatic weapons, also called for action to improve gun control. \\"This is a day of great sadness in America, and our hearts go out to the victims and their families,\\" Lautenberg said. \\"This latest shooting tragedy is an unthinkable act of violence carried out against young children and innocent people. Americans are sick and tired of these attacks on our children and neighbors and they are sick and tired of nothing being done in Washington to stop the bloodshed. If we do not take action to address gun violence, shooting tragedies like this will continue. As President Obama said, we must act now 'regardless of the politics.'\\" — This story was last updated at 4:35 p.m. ||||| The incoming chairwoman of the House Republican Conference urged caution in passing new gun laws. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), speaking in an interview with C-SPAN set to air Sunday, was asked whether it was time to review current gun laws in light of a shooting rampage in Connecticut. ADVERTISEMENT \\"We need to find out what happened and what drove this individual to this place,\\" McMorris Rodgers said. \\"I think we have to be careful about new —suggesting new gun laws. We need to look at what drives a crazy person to do these kind of actions and make sure that we’re enforcing the laws that are currently on the books. And yes, definitely, we need to do everything possible to make sure that something like this never happens again.\\"McMorris Rodgers's comments came in the aftermath of a shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn. on Friday. The shooting resulted in at least 20 children dead as well as an estimated seven adults including the shooter, according to Connecticut state police.Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), one of the firstreleased a statement on the shooting in which he called for tightening existing gun laws.\\"If now is not the time to have a serious discussion about gun control and the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our society, I don’t know when is,\\" Nadler said. ||||| In the wake of the deadly Connecticut school shooting, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy said she has warned the White House “the gloves are off” if President Obama fails to act on the issue. McCarthy (D-N.Y.), the foremost gun control advocate in Congress, said she spoke with White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew before Election Day and told him she will exert pressure on the White House to push for gun control legislation. “I said, ‘Jack, I know the president is going through an election and I’m telling you after the election I’m coming out full force,’” McCarthy told POLITICO Friday. “I was just giving the White House a heads up that the gloves are off on my side and I was going to do everything I possibly could. … If that meant embarrassing everybody, that’s what I would do.” Embarrassing the White House, McCarthy said, meant building a large-scale public campaign to ban assault weapons. She pledged to continue to work with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others to build support for her cause. “I want to talk to the White House. I know that they can’t give me an answer tonight, but I want to know what they’re going to do. I need to know what they’re going to do.” The Connecticut school shooting sent TV bookers and reporters seeking out McCarthy, a Democrat just elected to her ninth term whose husband was killed and son severely injured in a 1993 mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road. She has long sought to pass gun control legislation, most recently fighting to enact laws forbidding high-capacity gun clips like ones used in past mass shootings. It’s not yet clear if similar clips were used in the Friday massacre. McCarthy said she was pleased with Obama’s somber tone in his four-minute White House statement acknowledging Friday’s incident, but said action should have been taken long ago. “I agree, this is not the time to talk about (gun control),” she said. “It should have been talked about years ago when we started having these mass shootings. It should have been done when Gabby Giffords was shot.” (This post has been updated.)

To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan.

In the mid-1920s, citizens in Løgstør reduced a selection, which appeared with a number of suggestions for a bridge. However, the initiative stranded controversy about the alignment and funding. In 1936, the idea was resumed by the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Transport as a possible employment measure, and in 1939 the construction of the bridge, which was funded by Aalborg, Hjørring and Thisted Amter, began. The bridge was projected by Christen Ostenfeld. The initiation took place on 18 June 1942. The bridge cost about 3.5 million DKK. During the German occupation of Denmark, the bridge was strategically important for the German shipments of crew and equipment to and from Norway. Therefore, a military support point was built in 1943-44, consisting of 11 concrete plants on the north side and 6 on the south side. In addition, minefields and other types of barriers were introduced. Two large Flak bunkers on the south side and one on the north side are still available and are available. The other smaller bunkers have either been removed or located in a private area without public access.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step. 1. More conservation occurs: If there is more focus on conserving resources, it may lead to the growth of more plants and trees to increase the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 2. More resources filling the pores (stomata): Since stomata are primarily responsible for gas exchange, including taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, an increase in plants and trees would mean more stomata are available to facilitate the gas exchange process. 3. Perturbation influence on the second effect (Water absorption by roots and transportation to leaves): The water absorption and transportation processes are essential for photosynthesis, as water plays a crucial role in producing food and releasing oxygen in plants. Now, let's determine the impact of more conservation on the perturbation in the second effect. By conserving resources and promoting the growth of more plants and trees, the amount of stomata available for gas exchange will increase. This in itself has no direct impact on the water absorption and transportation processes in plants. However, if we were to consider that more plants and trees will require more water to sustain their growth and carry out photosynthesis efficiently, we can infer that the demand for water absorption and transportation would increase. In other words, more conservation could indirectly lead to an increase in water absorption and transportation through plants' roots and stems.

Step 2: Analyze the structure of the premises The statement tells us that there is a group of people and they are gathered around a mural. The location of this event is specified as an urban area. Step 3: Determine the logical relation between the premises and the conclusion We need to examine if \\"People are gathered around a mural\\" logically follows from the given statement. Step 4: Compare the premises and the conclusion The conclusion states that \\"People are gathered around a mural,\\" which aligns with the premise that a group of people (which means people) are gathered around a mural. The difference is that the premise specifies the location as an urban area, while the conclusion does not mention any location. Step 5: Assess if the conclusion logically follows from the premises Despite the difference in the specified location, the conclusion \\"People are gathered around a mural\\" still accurately captures the essence of the premise and follows logically. The location detail is unnecessary to validate the conclusion.

Unfortunately, this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project.

The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head.

He is the mutant son of Professor Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness including a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers. The television series Legion premiered on FX network in 2017. Charles Xavier met Gabrielle Haller while he was working in an Israeli psychiatric facility where she was one of his patients. Xavier was secretly using his psychic powers to ease the pain of Holocaust survivors institutionalized there. The two had an affair that resulted in the birth of their son David. Xavier was initially unaware of this, as Gabrielle never told him she was pregnant. When he was very young, David was among the victims of a terrorist attack, in which he was the only survivor. The trauma of the situation caused David to manifest his mutant powers, incinerating the minds of the terrorists. In the process, he absorbed the mind of the terrorist leader, Jemail Karami, into his own. Being linked to so many others at their time of death, he was rendered catatonic, and remained in the care of Moira MacTaggert at the Muir Island mutant research facility. The trauma caused David's personality to splinter, with each of the personalities controlling a different aspect of his psionic power. Karami struggled for years to separate his consciousness from David's. Using David's telepathic abilities, he reintegrated the multiple personalities into David's core personality. Some of the personalities resisted Karami, and two proved to be formidable opponents: Jack Wayne, a swaggering adventurer, who commands David's telekinetic power, and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who controls David's pyrokinetic power. Wayne intended to destroy Karami's consciousness to preserve his own independent existence within David's mind. Neither personality succeeds, and Karami, Wayne, and Cyndi continue as David's dominant personalities. During his time at Muir Island, David emerged from his catatonia. Soon after, David was possessed by the Shadow King, who used his powers to psychically increase the amount of hatred in the world and feed on the malignant energy. During this time, the Shadow King, as David, killed the mutant Destiny. The X-Men and X-Factor fought the Shadow King, and as a result, David was left in a coma.

Cardboard and other absorbent scrap material can be used as a makeshift tarp. If your doors have any marks or dents, now is the time to take care of them. Rub the spot to wear away the material around it. Keep doing this until the damage disappears, then sand the surrounding areas to blend them in and smooth out the finish.

See options at the end The answer could be found in the scroll, but not in the book, as the writing in the Pick from: [I] scroll was so cryptic. [II] book was so cryptic.","response":"The answer could be found in the scroll, but not in the book, as the writing in the scroll was so cryptic. The ancient scroll, carefully preserved and handed down through generations, contained mysterious symbols and coded messages that had been written by a secretive order of scholars and mystics. While the book, a more accessible and straightforward text, also touched upon related topics, it did not possess the depth or concealed knowledge embedded within the scroll's enigmatic language. The cryptic nature of the scroll's writing was, in part, a deliberate choice by its authors. They sought to both protect and preserve their treasured knowledge from falling into the wrong hands. The cryptic script and obscure symbols served as a kind of lock, allowing only those who possessed the key to unlock its hidden wisdom. In contrast, the book was written in a more conventional language, making it accessible to a wider audience. However, this accessibility came at the expense of the depth and richness of the secret teachings contained within the scroll. While the book could provide the reader with a general understanding of the subject, it lacked the transformative insights and esoteric knowledge that the scroll contained. To truly understand the scroll's meaning, one needed not only the key to decipher its symbols but also the eyes to see beyond the veil that obscured its hidden teachings. This required an in-depth knowledge of symbolism, a keen intuition, and a willingness to look beyond the surface to the deeper, hidden layers of meaning. Over time, as the scroll was carefully studied and interpreted by those who had the skills and abilities to unlock its secrets, the teachings it contained were gradually integrated into various schools of thought and practice. This, in turn, led to the growth and development of new knowledge and wisdom, which might then be incorporated into more accessible forms, such as the book, ensuring that at least part of the scroll's content could reach a wider audience. Nevertheless, the scroll remained elusive and enigmatic, its cryptic language continuing to challenge and inspire seekers of wisdom for generations to come. Ultimately, the choice of the scroll as the repository of this hidden knowledge served to protect those sacred teachings, ensuring that only the most dedicated and diligent students would be able to access the transformative power and insights it contained. To the committed, the scroll represented an unquenchable source of wisdom and inspiration, a testament to the human desire to explore the depths of knowledge and understanding that lay hidden within the world and within ourselves."},{"question":"Q: Context: The Arroyo Seco Parkway, formerly known as the Pasadena Freeway, is the first freeway in the Western United States.

The abysmal service, subpar food quality, and overall unhygienic conditions have compelled me to leave a candid account of the unfortunate events that transpired. First, let's begin with the reservation experience. Despite reserving a table in advance, my party and I were forced to wait for an intolerable 45 minutes before being seated. Worse still, the staff seemed to be unapologetic and nonchalant about this ordeal, which only added to our collective frustration. As for the ambiance, the place was utterly chaotic. The music was not just ear-splittingly loud but also wholly inappropriate for the type of establishment that \\"________\\" claims to be. It was virtually impossible to hold a conversation without screaming our lungs out, and diners around us were visibly put-off by the cacophony. Now, let's move on to the showstoppers of the evening — the food and drinks. The server took a painstakingly long time to bring our beverages, making it evident that they were both understaffed and poorly trained. When the drinks did arrive, they not only were lukewarm but also seemed diluted beyond tasting recognition. As if the wait hadn't been excruciating enough, the food only managed to deepen our disappointment. The dishes not only arrived at erratic intervals but were wildly inconsistent in terms of taste and presentation. My steak, requested medium-rare, arrived burnt to a crisp. The accompanying vegetables were overcooked, soggy, and tasteless. The pasta dish, which my friend ordered, had the distinct flavor of canned tomato sauce and stale noodles. Furthermore, we discovered a hair nestled amongst the cold and dreary fries that came with the burger. When we pointed it out to the server, we received lackluster apologies and half-hearted assurances that it wouldn't happen again. However, we weren't expecting much considering we'd previously asked the server for recommendations only to be met with an indifferent shrug and an unhelpful \\"everything's good.\\" Speaking of unhygienic conditions, the restrooms were atrocious. The odor emanating from the facilities was alarming, and basic sanitation appeared to be an afterthought. Despite the pandemic and obvious emphasis on cleanliness, hand sanitation stations were demonstrably absent from the premises. This was particularly concerning, considering that the staff was also not observed following proper hygiene protocols, such as wearing masks or gloves. While I understand that all establishments can have an off day, the cavalier attitude displayed by the staff and management, coupled with the inedible food and insufficient hygiene measures, has me convinced never to return to \\"________.\\" There are numerous alternatives in the area, and I strongly recommend that anyone considering a visit to this establishment should take their business elsewhere.

Reinforce sitting behavior with a clicker. Train your dog to sit or stay when the door is open. Be patient when training your dog. Keep your dog focused.\\"","response":"Title: The Art of Teaching Your Dog to Sit and Stay: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction Teaching your dog to sit and stay is a fundamental part of obedience training that can benefit both you and your canine companion. Not only can these commands help prevent your dog from engaging in undesirable behaviors, such as jumping on guests or bolting out the door, but they can also foster a stronger bond between you and your furry friend. In this article, we will explore the method to train your dog to sit and stay, emphasizing on rewarding natural sitting behavior, using a clicker, and maintaining patience during the training process. Step 1: Be Observant and Reward Natural Sitting Behavior Before jumping into using commands, it is essential to observe your dog and encourage good habits that arise naturally. Keep an eye on your dog and when you notice them sitting down without being prompted, shower them with praise and affection. This step lays the foundation for understanding better what is expected of them and increases the likelihood of success when you start using commands. Step 2: Begin Issuing the 'Sit' Command Once your dog has become familiar with the concept of sitting and receiving rewards, it's time to introduce the 'sit' command. Select a specific word or phrase and be consistent in using it. When your dog is in a standing position, issue the command and gently guide their hindquarters to the ground if they don't sit on their own. Then, immediately offer praise and a treat to reinforce the positive behavior. Step 3: Reinforce Sitting Behavior with a Clicker To further strengthen your dog's understanding of the 'sit' command, use a clicker as part of the training process. The clicker can be used to 'mark' the moment your dog complies with the command and offers an unmistakable link between the action and the reward. Over time, your dog will associate the sound of the clicker with performing the actions, making the training process more efficient. Step 4: Train Your Dog to Sit or Stay When the Door is Open To avoid potential safety hazards, it's crucial to teach your dog to sit or stay when the door is open. Begin by working on the 'sit' and 'stay' commands individually, and once your dog is proficient in both, bring the two commands together. Practice this training near the door by asking your dog to sit and stay, then opening the door slightly. Gradually increase the door's openness, rewarding your dog for maintaining their position. Step 5: Be Patient When Training Your Dog Patience is an essential aspect of effective dog training. Each dog has a different learning curve, and progress may be slower or faster than anticipated. Maintaining patience and calmness throughout the training process will improve your bond with your dog and lead to a more rewarding and enjoyable experience for both of you. Step 6: Keep Your Dog Focused Although training sessions can be fun, it's important to keep your dog's focus and minimize distractions. Choose a quiet space to work in, keep training sessions short (about 10-15 minutes), and be consistent with your commands and rewards. Over time, your dog's ability to concentrate on the task at hand will improve, leading to more successful training sessions. Conclusion Teaching your dog to sit and stay can be an enjoyable and fulfilling aspect of pet ownership. By looking for and rewarding natural sitting behavior, using a clicker, and practicing patience, you can help your canine companion learn these essential commands and improve their overall behavior and obedience. Remember, consistency and a strong bond between you and your dog are fundamental for successful dog training."},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more contact is made with a virus happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can indeed have a direct and indirect effect on the process. Direct Effect: Hypothetically, if more contact is made with the virus, theoretically, more viral particles can enter and potentially infect the host organism, thus leading to more cells being targeted and possibly damaged, which is contrary to the desired effect of having less cell damage. Indirect Effect: However, it is also crucial to consider the immune system's role in this process. If more contacts are made with the virus, the immune system's response may also increase, potentially minimizing the number of cells that the viruses can infect and damage. This effect, though, is highly dependent on the individual's immune system strength and resilience. Lastly, regular exposure also increases the chances of developing immunity, either through the development of antibodies from a previous encounter or through vaccination. This immunity can help reduce cell damage due to future encounters with the virus, thus achieving the stated goal indirectly. However, this should not be used as a strategy to expose oneself deliberately to a virus, especially lethal ones, as this could result in severe illness or death. In summary, while more contact with the virus might typically suggest more potential cell damage, the complexity of the immune response and the development of immunity can play significant roles, potentially leading to less cell damage in the long run."},{"question":"Translate to Czech: Consell de Cent, 389 Planta PR, Puerta 2 08009 Barcelona ESPAÑA Date, entry into force and nature of the decision On 24 January 2012, decision by the Board of Directors of the National Bank of Belgium to lift the decision of 4 March 2011 of the Commission for Banking, Financial Affairs and Insurance to suspend the performance of all current insurance agreements, except for the payment of advances under clearly-defined conditions, under Article 26 § 1 subpara.

It has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. What it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me for one second. When the end-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer Christopher Smith (in his debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the \\"creep\\" in the London subway. The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor George Clooney who's in town to present his new film. She falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards or sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! I really dug the creep-character! He's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. I reckon this isn't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content, but I forgive Smith and I think it's better this way than going over the top completely, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\"-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the Creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! There's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There also is some acting-talent present in this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film \\"Anatomie\\". Creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I'll keep an eye on. Make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film... Would you say this review is positive or negative?","response":"I would say this review is mostly positive. The reviewer appreciates the tension, adrenaline-rushing action, and the gore in the movie. They also emphasize the fascinating character of the \\"creep\\" and the effectiveness of the abandoned London subway setting.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If there is an increase in sedimentation, it can potentially have an effect on the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the environment. To understand this, we need to first analyze the process of sedimentation and then explore how it might influence the production of carbon dioxide, as well as how it could impact the second effect mentioned, which is engines producing carbon dioxide. Sedimentation is the process where solid particles, such as minerals, organic matter, and dead organisms, settle out of a fluid or are accumulated as sediment. This process plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, as it can affect the distribution and storage of carbon-containing compounds, including carbon dioxide. An increase in sedimentation might have both direct and indirect impacts on the CO2 levels in the environment: 1. Direct impact: When the sedimentation rate increases, it leads to an increase in the burial of organic carbon present in the sediment. When organic matter is buried and protected from oxygen in the environment, it slows down the decomposition process, reducing the release of CO2 back into the atmosphere. This means that increased sedimentation could potentially lead to less CO2 being released into the atmosphere as a result of the decomposition of organic matter. 2. Indirect impact: Increased sedimentation can affect the productivity and diversity of ecosystems, such as oceans and forests, which are known to be significant carbon sinks. These ecosystems absorb a considerable amount of CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in the form of biomass. If sedimentation alters these ecosystems' ability to function efficiently, it might result in an imbalance in carbon uptake, leading, in turn, to an increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Now, let's examine the potential influence of increased sedimentation on the second effect mentioned, which is engines producing CO2. Increased sedimentation, as mentioned earlier, can have an impact on the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This might affect the availability and quality of natural resources, such as fuel sources like fossil fuels or biofuels that are used in engines. If increased sedimentation leads to a degradation of these resources or makes them less available, it could result in a decreased use of engine-based systems, decreasing CO2 emissions produced by engines. However, if increased sedimentation results in a more significant reliance on non-renewable energy sources or less efficient engines due to a shortage of alternative fuel sources, it could lead to an increase in CO2 emissions produced by engines. In conclusion, the overall effect of increased sedimentation on carbon dioxide levels in the environment is complex. It could lead to less CO2 being released into the atmosphere due to a delay in the decomposition process, but it might also lead to an imbalance in carbon uptake by ecosystems, potentially increasing CO2 levels. The influence of increased sedimentation on the CO2 emissions produced by engines is also situation-dependent and could result in either more or less CO2 emissions. As a result, the overall effect of increased sedimentation on CO2 levels in the environment and its influence on engine-produced CO2 emissions cannot be conclusively predicted as more, less, or no effect without considering specific scenarios and the interconnected factors at play."},{"question":"I wish I can give no star at all.

But that doesn't matter. We think this race needs a dose of Biden, and here's why: Biden and President Barack Obama have one of the most well-documented bromances in the history of bromances. They work out together. They lunch weekly together. They eat Shake Shack after they work out. They even take selfies. But despite the bromance, it's unclear whether President Obama would be on Team Biden. Obama's administration has strong ties with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and it will certainly be a difficult situation to navigate if Biden and Clinton go head to head. Asked about a potential Biden 2016 campaign, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest didn't say whether President Obama would be on board. Everyone knows that Biden makes some pretty amazing faces, but did you know that he is also one of the foremost experts in making finger guns? Biden's finger guns show us that he can lead the free world and have swag. Biden posted this #TBT in 2014 as part of a campaign to let young people know that they should consider getting health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Using the power of a short-sleeved button down and vintage shot (#nofilter) and social media, Biden made it clear to young people that health insurance matters. Short sleeve button-downs are coming back but health care has always been in style. #Bornin88? Then #GetCovered. #TBT pic.twitter.com/XeMmUPC2Go — Vice President Biden (@VP) July 31, 2014 Instead of going to the White House Correspondents dinner, Biden and 'Veep' Selina Meyers aka Julia Louis-Dreyfus ran around Washington D.C. in a yellow Corvette, ate ice cream and wrecked some havoc at the Washington Post. They even got matching tattoos. Finger guns and flashy sports cars aside aside, Biden is considering the run because of a conversation he had with his son, Beau Biden. As Maureen Dowd reported in the New York Times, Beau had strongly advocated for the idea in one of the last conversations between the two: “Dad, I know you don’t give a damn about money,” Beau told him, dismissing the idea that his father would take some sort of cushy job after the vice presidency to cash in. Beau was losing his nouns and the right side of his face was partially paralyzed. But he had a mission: He tried to make his father promise to run, arguing that the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values. Biden speaks frequently about what family means to him. In a moving speech at Yale University's commencement, Biden talked about how his extended family supported him when he lost his first wife and his daughter in a car crash and how he found redemption by focusing on his sons. Back then, he was a newly elected senator. Biden would commute for four hours a day — between Delaware and Washington — in order to spend time with his family. As Biden puts it, his definition of success is when his children \\"turn out better\\" than him. Beau Biden died of brain cancer shortly after Biden gave this speech.

Speculation that Vice President Joe Biden could enter the 2016 presidential race, with a decision likely to be made by September. 2. Biden's meeting with Massachusetts Sen.

The challenges Biden would face in winning the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton's strong campaign and fundraising efforts. 4. Factors that make Biden a potentially appealing candidate, including his close relationship with President Obama, his charisma and swag, and his focus on healthcare and family values. 5.

But Mr Farron also advocated replacing the current system of continuous-at-sea deterrence with more irregular patrolling patterns. And he accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of being \\"weak and dangerous\\" on defence matters. Earlier this week, Mr Corbyn - a long-standing opponent of nuclear weapons - said \\"all aspects\\" of defence would be reviewed if he won power in the snap election on 8 June. \\"I have made clear there would be no first use of it and that any use of nuclear weapons would be a disaster for the world,\\" he told Andrew Marr on BBC One. His party, however, issued a statement later the same day clarifying that Labour as a whole was in favour of renewing the existing Trident nuclear weapons system. MPs overwhelmingly voted earlier this year to build four new submarines to carry missiles armed with nuclear warheads. They are intended to replace the existing Vanguard fleet from the early 2030s at an estimated cost of Â£31bn. Mr Farron was expected to make his comments in a speech to supporters in Portsmouth, but the Lib Dems said the visit had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. The pre-released text of his speech said: \\"If you say that you would never press the button, as Jeremy Corbyn seems to have suggested, that makes a mockery of having a deterrent or indeed sound defences.\\" He added that the Liberal Democrats are committed to Nato, the European Union and the United Nations. \\"We believe that our safety and security as a country is best achieved through co-operating with the UK's allies,\\" he said. \\"That is why we are committed to maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent, because there is nothing to gain from walking away from the table and turning our back on those who rely on our protection.\\" Switching from a continuous at-sea deterrent to irregular patrols \\"would maintain the ability to surge to more frequent armed patrols, or drop down to a low-readiness posture if the security situation allows\\", he argued. Mr Farron also said the party's long-term goal will \\"always be a nuclear-free world\\", and it would use the UK's position to lead international efforts towards multilateral disarmament. The Lib Dems have faced division on the issue in the past, with some activists calling for Trident to be axed, saying it is expensive and unnecessary. A commitment to replacing Trident was a Conservative manifesto pledge in the last general election in 2015.

Adam W. Purinton, 51, allegedly shot Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32; Alok Madasani, 32, of Overland Park, and another bar patron, 24-year-old Ian Grillot of Grandview. Kuchibhotla died at a hospital after the 7:15 p.m. shooting in Austins Bar & Grill near 151st Street and Mur-Len Road.

SUBSCRIBE NOW Purinton also is charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder in the shootings of Madasani and Grillot. Witnesses said Grillot was shot after he intervened. Madasani was released Thursday from a hospital, where Grillot is improving. The two even talked with each other Thursday. In a video released by the University of Kansas Health System, Grillot spoke about how he jumped at the shooter. “It wasn’t right, and I didn’t want the gentleman to potentially go after somebody else,” Grillot said. (See sidebar.) Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe announced the charges against Purinton during a press conference at Olathe police headquarters. He was joined by federal law enforcement officials who said that they are investigating in conjunction with Olathe police to determine if the shooting was a bias-motivated hate crime in violation of the victims’ civil rights. At least one witness reportedly heard the man yell “get out of my country” shortly before shooting Kuchibhotla and Madasani. The man fled on foot. A manhunt ensued. Five hours later, Purinton reportedly told a bartender at a bar in an Applebee’s in Clinton, Mo., that he needed a place to hide out because he had just killed two Middle Eastern men, The Star has learned. The bartender called police, and Purinton was arrested without incident, Assistant Clinton Police Chief Sonny Lynch said. Purinton was not armed. “It was a tragic and senseless act of violence,” said Olathe Police Chief Steven Menke. After his arrest in Clinton, Purinton — a Navy veteran, IT specialist, former pilot and air traffic controller who lives in a comfortable suburban home — was booked into the Henry County Jail. Purinton appeared before a judge in Henry County and waived his right to fight extradition. Bond was set at 2 million. It was not known how soon he would be returned to Johnson County. Both Howe and Eric Jackson, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Kansas City office, cautioned they were too early in their investigation to assign a motive or call it a hate crime. “We’re less than 24 hours in,” Howe said. “We want to be sure of the facts versus speculation.” Jackson said it was not “uncommon” for joint federal and local law enforcement investigations into possible hate crimes. Tom Beall, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Kansas, said his office would be evaluating the case as more facts are gathered in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice. “There will probably be more to come later from us,” Beall said. SHARE COPY LINK Jon Cassat, vice president of communications for Garmin, speaks about employees who were victims of Wednesday's shooting in Olathe. Two associates of the Aviation Systems Engineering team, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, were shot. Kuchibh Garmin engineers Kuchibhotla and Madasani were employees of the Aviation Systems Engineering team at Garmin Ltd., headquartered in Olathe. Garmin officials broke the news to employees in an email Thursday morning. “Unfortunately, two associates on our Aviation Systems Engineering team, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, were shot. We are devastated to inform you that Srinivas passed away and Alok is currently recovering in the hospital,” Garmin said in the email. In a public statement, Garmin said, “We’re saddened that two Garmin associates were involved in last night’s incident, and we express our condolences to the family and friends of our co-workers involved. Garmin will have grievance counselors on-site and available for its associates today and tomorrow.” Kuchibhotla posted on LinkedIn in 2014 that he managed helicopter programs. He had a master’s degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso. He earned his bachelor’s degree at the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in India. A 2014 post on LinkedIn said Madasani was an aviation program coordinator manager at Garmin. He studied at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and at Vasavi College of Engineering in India. Two GoFundMe pages have been set up for the Garmin workers and a third for Grillot. One, for Kuchibhotla’s family, said “Srini was the kindest person you would meet, full of love, care and compassion for everyone. He never uttered a word of hatred, a simple gossip, or a careless comment. He was brilliant, well mannered and simply an outstanding human being. “His wife Sunayana and his family are now faced with incredible grief and a multitude of expenses. “We’ve set up this fund to help them with the funeral expenses and other ongoing grief/recovery support costs. This includes the very expensive process of carrying his mortal remains back to India, so his parents can say goodbye one last time to their beloved son.” By Thursday evening, contributors had exceeded the 150,000 goal for Kuchibholta’s fund. The other GoFundMe page was set up by a western Shawnee man who was not personally connected to either of the victims or their families but was upset about what appeared to be “a vicious hate crime.” “Madasani will likely face extensive medical bills and the family of Kuchibhotla will now have to deal with the death of their beloved son, both financially and emotionally,” Brian Eric Ford wrote on the page. “Let’s send a message that we will support those who are targeted — and stand against all who wish to spread hate — by raising funds to help the victims of this horrendous act of senseless violence.” Ford said he planned to present the money raised to Garmin. Contributors had pledged more than 19,000 of the 50,000 goal by Thursday evening. A third victim, Ian Grillot, was shot in the hand and chest. A GoFundMe site had been set up for him and had raised 67,000 of its 80,000 goal. On Wednesday night, Kuchibhotla and Madasani had been at the bar for about 30 minutes or so. Around that same time, Grillot, a sometimes daily regular who either stops for a drink or grabs something to eat, was in the parking lot. “Ian’s a really good guy,” said Garret Bohnen, who has served him at Austins. “He’s been going there forever. We’ve always had a good time with him. He’s always one to defuse stuff.” Witnesses said Purinton was drinking and spouting racial slurs at Kuchibhotla and Madasani. At one point, Purinton is thought to have been kicked out of the bar before coming back and shooting. Grillot stepped in and was shot.

Grillot intervened after a man was yelling racial slurs at two men he reportedly thought were Middle Eastern. One of those men died. This footage is from Community grieves The Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations on Thursday called for prosecutors to file hate crime charges against Purinton at both the state and federal level. Moussa Elbayoumy, board chairman of the Kansas chapter, said that doing so would “send a strong message that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be tolerated.” He noted that two southwest Kansas men were sentenced in federal court on Wednesday in connection with a hate attack on three Somali Muslims outside an African grocery store in Dodge City in 2015. And CAIR’s national headquarters in Washington, D.C., has seen an unprecedented increase in hate incidents targeting Muslims and other minority groups since the Nov. 8 election, Elbayoumy said. Indeed, he said, a report about to be released on Islamophobia in America is expected to show that last year was the worst on record for incidents of bias toward mosques. Olathe Mayor Michael Copeland on Thursday said he was shocked and saddened. “We pray that those in mourning will find comfort in the outpouring of love and support across our community,” Copeland said. Austins remained closed Thursday, a day after the shooting. Owner Brandon Blum, family and staff gathered there Thursday afternoon. In a statement later Thursday, Blum expressed empathy for the victims and their families. “We are so sorry that this happened on our premises,” Blum said. “We have never experienced any sort of tragedy like this in our 30 years. For all of our loyal friends and patrons, we want to thank you for your ongoing support.” Blum said the bar would re-open Saturday to give staff and patrons some time to process the shooting. “We will be working diligently doing anything we can to support and help the parties that were involved,” he said.

Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, is a small Polynesian island located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, famous for its gigantic stone statues, called moai. The island has long held mysteries for historians, archaeologists, and tourists alike, which is why it comes as no surprise that a creative genius like Albee would be drawn to its enigmatic appeal. In this article, we will delve into Albee's journey to Easter Island, exploring its sights and sounds through his creative lens and perspectives. A Journey of Inspiration Edward Albee, having conquered the world of theater, sought out new landscapes to inspire his literary creations. Upon learning about Easter Island's history and enigma, he realized that it was an ideal destination for fueling his imaginative pursuits. Thus, Albee set off on a journey to the remote island, ready to absorb its palpable energy. Exploring the Moai Statues Upon arriving on Easter Island, Albee was immediately captivated by the vast, open landscape, marked by the towering moai statues. These monuments were created by the Rapa Nui people between 1250 and 1500, and they continue to mystify researchers today, who debate the meaning behind them and the methods of their construction and transportation. Albee, being an artist himself, was not merely content with observing from afar. He ventured closer, attempting to decipher the faces carved into the stone, contemplating the emotions they conveyed. The moai acted as muses for Albee, provoking existential questions that would later make their way into his work, blending the small island's rich history with the playwright's masterful storytelling skills. The Rapa Nui Culture and Heritage Though best known for the enigmatic moai, Easter Island also boasts a wealth of cultural heritage, and Albee was determined to take it all in. He attended local festivals with traditional music and dance performances, marveling at how the Rapa Nui people preserved their ancient customs despite centuries of colonization and external influence. Edward Albee also immersed himself in the island's history, visiting the renowned Rano Raraku quarry, where the stone for the moai statues was sourced, and the Orongo ceremonial village. It is at the latter where the unique Birdman cult rituals were performed until the latter half of the 19th century. The Lessons from Easter Island As a world-class playwright, Albee approached his journey to Easter Island not simply as a sightseeing tour but as an opportunity to learn and grow as an artist. He came to realize that Rapa Nui's history was punctuated by episodes of environmental and societal collapse. Overpopulation paired with the depletion of limited resources led to conflict and the decline of once-thriving communities. This story resonated with Albee, who saw in it a cautionary tale for modern society – a theme that would make its way into his later work. Conclusion Edward Albee's travels to Easter Island provided the playwright with a wealth of inspiration, derived from the island's captivating landscape, majestic moai statues, and the resilience of Rapa Nui culture. The lessons he gleaned during his time on the island – themes of societal and environmental collapse, and the importance of preserving cultural heritage – were woven into his subsequent theatrical masterpieces. Easter Island's enigma proved to be the perfect catalyst for Edward Albee's creative genius, resulting in his continued impact on the world of theater and the human experience."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, California, the eldest son of Audree Neva (nee Korthof) and Murry Wilson. His two younger brothers were Dennis and Carl. He has English, Swedish, Dutch, German, and Irish ancestry. When Brian was two, the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby Hawthorne, California. Speaking of Brian's unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, his father said that, as a baby, he could repeat the melody from \\"When the Caissons Go Rolling Along\\" after only a few verses had been sung by the father. Murry Wilson said, \\"He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him.\\" At about age two, Brian heard George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which had an enormous emotional impact on him. A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially deaf to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully, being to blame. While Brian's father Murry was ostensibly a reasonable provider, he was often abusive. A minor musician and songwriter, he also encouraged his children in this field in numerous ways. At an early age, Brian was given six weeks of lessons on a \\"toy accordion\\" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him. At Hawthorne High School, Brian was on the football team as a quarterback, played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year. He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of the Four Freshmen by listening to short segments of their songs on a phonograph, then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard. He received a Wollensak tape recorder on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals. Surviving home tapes document his initial efforts singing with various friends and family. In his senior year at Hawthorne High, in addition to classroom music studies, he sang at lunch time with friends like Keith Lent and Bruce Griffin. Brian and Keith worked on a revised version of the tune \\"Hully Gully\\" to support the campaign of a classmate named Carol Hess when she ran for senior class president. Enlisting his cousin and frequent singing partner Mike Love as well as his own brother Carl, Brian's next public performance featured more ambitious arrangements at a fall arts program at his high school. To entice Carl into the group, Brian named the newly formed membership Carl and the Passions. The performance featured tunes by Dion and the Belmonts and the Four Freshmen (\\"It's a Blue World\\"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Brian in the audience that night, Al Jardine, who would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys. Did he live with his parent?","response":"Yes, he did live with his parents. When Brian was two years old, his family moved from Inglewood to a different house in nearby Hawthorne, California. His dad loved music too and encouraged Brian and his brothers to play and sing from a young age. They practiced together at home, so Brian lived with his mom and dad during this time."},{"question":"You will be given a sentence.

Article: Dorothea Dix left home at an early age--of her own free will--to live with her grandmother. At fourteen, Dorothea was teaching school at Worcester, Massachusetts. A short time after she had begun teaching, she set up a school for young girls in her grandparents' home. Stress was placed on moral character at Dorothea's school, which she conducted until she was thirty-three. She was forced to give up teaching at her grandparents' home, however, when she became ill a few years of inactivity followed. In 1841 Dorothea began to teach again, accepting a Sunday school class in the East Cambridge, Massachusetts prison. Here she first came upon insane people locked up together with prisoners. In those days insane people were treated even worse than prisoners. There were only a few madhouses in the entire country. Therefore prisons, poor houses, and houses of correction were used to keep the insane. Dorothea Dix made a careful investigation of the inhuman treatment of the insane. It was considered unfeminine for a woman to devote herself to such work at this time. But this did not stop Dorothea Dix from providing proper medical care for the insane. Gradually, because of her investigations, conditions were improved. More than thirty mental institutions were founded or rebuilt in the United States because of her hard work. Dorothea also spread her investigations to England and to other parts of Europe. During the Civil War, Dorothea served as superintendent of women hospital nurses in the Union army.

The sound of clacking gradually fills the room as my brother reluctantly turns up the volume. I can tell he's pressing hard on the button, jamming his thumb down in defiance or muted anger. He doesn't like for anyone to tell him what to do with the remote. But my grandmother wants the volume up, so we turn it up. We're all sitting along the edges of the tiny living room, staring at the fuzzy black-and-white images as they hazily walk across the television screen. I can hear a siren outside, barely discernable and then gone entirely. \\"Who's that?\\" my brother asks, evidently past his momentary and barely-noticeable indignation over the remote. \\"Uncle Arehl, and maybe his sister, Edna,\\" my grandmother says, leaning in closer. \\"I think it's Edna,\\" she says, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing a disease, as if the verdict was somehow relevant to someone who has only the vaguest idea who Arehl's sister is, or was. Uncle Arehl (I don't know precisely whose uncle he is, or for what the two initials of his name once stood) saunters slowly across a dry, patchy lawn, and the camera follows him. For some reason I'm more interested in the lawn--if it can be called that--than in the people on it. The sun in the movie is blazing, and everyone filmed looks only briefly at the camera before averting their faces once again to look at the stubbly grass. The camera pans once again and I can see an incredibly rutted path leading from the porch to the fence at the edge of the yard, broken pieces of concrete amid deep tire tracks fossilized in sun-baked mud. The fence is low, wire like a chain-link, but lower, with metal stakes holding it up instead of tubes. Question: How long had they been watching the movie?

However, I must admit that from the get-go, my experience using this app has been nothing less than disappointing, horrendous, and frustrating. Firstly, the installation process was painfully slow and confusing. The app was not user-friendly, providing no proper instructions or guides about its usage. I had to scour the internet to find resources that could help me understand the app's functions and packages. For a company as big and reputed as Google, I find this reluctance to be considerate of their users quite alarming. Once I started using the app, I realized that it eats up a significant amount of battery life. For an app that's supposed to assist with my device's smooth functioning, it caused my phone to constantly heat up and slow down significantly. My battery would drain drastically, forcing me to uninstall other essential apps to manage battery life. The app also came with a host of unwanted and intrusive permissions, granting itself access to my personal information and location data without properly explaining the necessity for such permissions. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe, realizing that my privacy was being invaded by this seemingly untrustworthy app. Moreover, the constant stream of updates and bug fixes became unbearable. With each update, new issues and errors emerged, which further hampered the app's performance. Notifications for these updates would incessantly pop up on my device, interrupting me during important tasks or conversations. One would expect a seamless and smooth user experience from an app associated with Google, but instead, com.google.android.gms seems hell-bent on being nothing more than an appalling, defective app that poses a threat to its users' privacy. Customer support was equally unhelpful and inefficient. They were unresponsive, vague, and had a lackluster attitude towards addressing my concerns. It's disheartening to see such poor customer service from a widely recognized company. In conclusion, my experience with this app has been nothing short of a total disaster. Its poor performance, intrusive permissions, constant updates, battery consumption, and unhelpful customer support make me question Google's priorities in providing a user-friendly app. I would not recommend this app to anyone and strongly advise users to find alternatives that protect their privacy and provide a better experience. This app might come from a big-name company, but it scores a solid 1 star for its lack of commitment to users' needs and privacy concerns."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"When did the first true birds appear?\\" is in \\"The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving dinosaurs, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs. True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period.

Article: People diet to look more attractive.Fish diet to avoid being beaten up,thrown out of their social group,and getting eaten as a result.That is the fascinating conclusion of the latest research into fish behavior by a team of Australian scientists. The research team have discovered that subordinate fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors.\\"In studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals,a male and female,had breeding rights within the group,\\" explains Marian Wong.\\"All other group members are nonbreeding females,each being 5-10% smaller than its next largest competitor.We wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation.\\" The reason for the size difference was easy to see.Once a subordinate fish grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it causes a fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group.More often than not, _ is then eaten up. It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast. The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small. While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable. The research has proved the fact that voluntary dieting is a habit far from exclusive to humans.\\"As yet,we...

In the first sentence, it says that when employees' arrival and departure times for a pay period are established, they become the basis for recorded T&A data unless there are material variances or deviations. The second sentence states that the basis of the schedules comes from employees' arrival and departure times. Essentially, both sentences underline that employees' arrival and departure times serve as the foundation for the schedules being created.

Standing in the hall is his brother-in-law, Ollie Higgins (Phillip Coolidge). Title and credits are shown over the march to the chamber. In a nearby lab, Dr. Warren Chapin (Vincent Price) prepares for the state required autopsy of the convicted and executed man. The body is wheeled from the execution chamber to the lab on a gurney. Chapin does his work and Ollie comes in to watch. They chat about the electrocution and Chapin notes, \\"This man's vertebrae are cracked.

William Castle's psychological horror film revolves around Dr. Warren Chapin's (Vincent Price) research into the Tingler's existence and his attempts to prove its deadly effects. Martha (Judith Evelyn), a deaf and mute woman who is also Ollie Higgins' (Phillip Coolidge) wife, becomes the Tingler's next victim. She is unable to scream, which prevents her from releasing the fear-induced tension within her body. This creates a perfect environment for the Tingler to thrive, as it continues to inflict pain and torment on her. As the movie unfolds, Martha experiences increasing levels of fear and anxiety due to a series of strange and frightening occurrences in her apartment. The Tingler ultimately capitalizes on this amplified fear, causing her immense pain. Eventually, the Tingler drives Martha to the point of death as she is unable to scream and release the tension that the Tingler feeds on. After Martha's death, Dr. Chapin manages to extract the Tingler from her spine, proving its existence and the significance of his research. He then further emphasizes the importance of screaming as a natural response to fear, not only as a way to alleviate tension but also as an act that can potentially save a person's life from the deadly grasp of the Tingler."},{"question":"Eight Hornets were also deployed from Perth to RAAF Base Pearce in October 2011 to protect the CHOGM meeting in nearby Williamstown .

The moment I walked in, I was greeted with the pungent smell of burnt food, which didn't exactly ignite my appetite. To add to it, the lighting was too dim making it almost impossible to read the menu properly. I could barely see my food clearly, and when you're eating at a place with questionable hygiene, that's not exactly a comforting thought. Now let's talk about the service - a complete disaster. It took an entire eternity for someone to come and take my order, and when they finally did, the server had no clear idea about the menu items and was unable to answer any questions regarding ingredients or possible allergens. Clearly, the staff was undertrained, if they received any training at all. Communication was a struggle, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it took almost an hour for our food to arrive. When the food finally came, it was a true disaster. I ordered their \\"signature dish,\\" which was supposed to be a delicious piece of art, but turned out to be a travesty. The dish was utterly lacking in flavor and seasoning. The meat was overcooked, making it dry and tough to chew. The vegetables, on the other hand, were undercooked and nearly inedible.

Solve this problem.","response":"To solve the equation 0 = 414*j - 430*j - 256 for j, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms On the left-hand side of the equation, we have two terms that both involve the variable j (414*j and -430*j). We can combine these terms by performing the subtraction operation as shown: 0 = (414 - 430)*j - 256 Step 2: Perform the subtraction Now, we perform the subtraction operation in the parentheses: 0 = (-16)*j - 256 Step 3: Isolate the variable term To isolate the j term, we need to move the constant term (-256) to the other side of the equation. This can be done by adding 256 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 256 = (-16)*j - 256 + 256 256 = -16*j Step 4: Solve for j Finally, to find the value of j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the j term (-16): 256 / -16 = -16*j / -16 -16 = j So, j = -16."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

(October 2015) Calvin \\"Babyface\\" Simms (Marlon Wayans) is a very short convict. With the help of his goofball cohort Percy (Tracy Morgan), Calvin plots a jewellery shop robbery to steal one of the world's largest diamonds. After the successful robbery, the duo are almost arrested, but not before Calvin manages to stash the diamond in a nearby woman's purse. The thieves follow the handbag's owner to her home where they discover a couple, Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa Edwards (Kerry Washington), who are eager to have a child. Calvin and Percy hatch a plot to pass Calvin off as a baby left on the couple's doorstep. Darryl and Vanessa, wanting a child, immediately adopt the baby as their own. However, Vanessa's dad Francis \\"Pops\\" (John Witherspoon) has a bad feeling about Calvin. Friends of the couple find Calvin odd as well. A local goon named Walken (Chazz Palminteri), discovers the deception and demands the diamond from Percy. Percy sells out Darryl and now Calvin, in a series of comedic maneuvers, manages to rescue Darryl and have Walken arrested. Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police. Before he leaves, Calvin thanks Darryl for taking care of him even though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl would make a great father for a real child someday. Calvin is about to be out of Darryl's life for good, as Darryl watches him leave. Calvin is crying hysterically, so Darryl decides to let Calvin stay and from that point on, the two men become the best of friends.

Because of their very high frequencies, gamma rays have more energy than any other electromagnetic waves. Q: Which of the electromagnetic waves have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies? Choices: - ultraviolet - beta - plasma - gamma A: A:","response":"The electromagnetic waves that have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies are gamma rays. This is evident from the given paragraph, which states, \\"Of all electromagnetic waves, gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies.\\" Gamma-rays are extremely high-frequency and powerful forms of electromagnetic radiation. Their superior energy levels allow them to penetrate materials that other forms of electromagnetic waves cannot. Comparing gamma rays to the other choices: - Ultraviolet: Ultraviolet waves have relatively shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies compared to visible light, but their frequencies are still not nearly as high as those of gamma rays. - Beta: Beta doesn't refer to an electromagnetic wave; instead, it refers to beta particles, which are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted in the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei, and therefore it doesn't fit as an answer to the question. - Plasma: Plasma is not a type of electromagnetic wave, but rather a state of matter that consists of a collection of charged particles, such as ions and electrons.

Denis Villeneuve has masterfully crafted an intelligent and immersive science fiction drama that raises thought-provoking questions, while also boasting impressive visual effects and exceptional performances. The film opens with linguistics professor Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) being recruited by the military to assist in decoding alien communications. Earth has been visited by twelve mysterious monolithic spacecraft, whose occupants attempt to contact humanity for unknown reasons. Assisted by theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Dr. Banks tries to unravel the aliens' complex language known as the \\"logograms.\\" Amy Adams' portrayal of Dr. Louise Banks is nothing short of remarkable. As the character grapples with personal losses while attempting to communicate with the extraterrestrials, Adams weaves a multi-layered performance that is both subtle and emotionally powerful. Jeremy Renner's Ian Donnelly provides an endearing contrast to Adams' character, as well as a sense of camaraderie throughout the film. Forest Whitaker completes the main cast, providing a commanding presence as Colonel Weber, the military officer overseeing the team's collaboration with the aliens. The narrative of \\"Arrival\\" is constructed with masterful skill by screenwriter Eric Heisserer, who adapted the film from the short story \\"Story of Your Life\\" by Ted Chiang. Heisserer creates a world steeped in mystery, with the aliens' motives and their impact on humanity gradually revealed in ways that challenge traditional storytelling conventions. The non-linear aspect of the narrative, combined with clever twists and turns, keeps the audience engaged and guessing until the very end. Denis Villeneuve's direction, paired with Bradford Young's cinematography, lends a distinctly brooding visual style to the film. The landscapes surrounding the spacecraft are vast, desolate, and eerie, creating an atmosphere of dread and wonder. The aliens, known as Heptapods, interact with the human characters from behind a foggy translucent barrier, enhancing the sense of otherworldliness and inaccessibility. The visual effects employed are both practical and seamlessly integrated, ensuring that the narrative doesn't become overwhelmed by spectacle. The exploration of language and communication in \\"Arrival\\" takes center stage. The film delves into the intricacies of deciphering an entirely alien form of communication and showcases the importance of collaboration and understanding. It is fascinating to watch Adams' and Renner's characters as they piece together the Heptapods' language, which is depicted as circular, intricate symbols. The concept of linguistic relativity, the idea that one's perception of the world is shaped by their language, presents a central theme in the story, allowing for a more philosophical and introspective examination of the human condition. \\"Arrival\\" is a landmark in the sci-fi genre -- a mature and contemplative film that challenges viewers to engage with big ideas and complex emotions. Anchored by Adams' spellbinding performance, this cerebral narrative makes a powerful statement about the importance of empathy, understanding, and the unshakable bonds that tie us together. Unraveling the mysteries of the Heptapods serves as a captivating journey that stays with you long after the credits roll."},{"question":"Answer the following question, with explanation first.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"I rode the motorcycle off the ramp\\" - Sentence B: \\"I rode the motorcycle off a lion\\"","response":"To determine the nonsensical sentence, let's analyze both sentences. - Sentence A: \\"I rode the motorcycle off the ramp\\" In this sentence, the subject (I) rides a motorcycle, which is a normal activity. The action performed is \\"riding off a ramp,\\" which is a possible scenario in motorcycle stunts or just in everyday life, like exiting a parking area. So, this sentence makes sense. - Sentence B: \\"I rode the motorcycle off a lion\\" In this sentence, the subject (I) again rides a motorcycle. However, the action is \\"riding off a lion.\\" Riding a motorcycle off a lion is not a plausible scenario. Lions are living creatures, making them an unlikely structure to support or be involved in riding a motorcycle. So, this sentence is nonsensical.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS, which, in turn, had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company, but then sold off). ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom, but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia. RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company. The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC's other labels. This allowed ARC's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records. Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label. Wallerstein, who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company, restored Columbia's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing (LP) record before he retired as Columbia's chairman in 1951. James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records.

For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Which would be lighter, item A or item B? A:","response":"Item B would be lighter. This is because item A represents the Earth, which has a mean specific gravity of 5.515, while item B represents a sample of surface rock with a typical specific gravity between 2.7 and 3.3. The higher specific gravity of the Earth (item A) indicates that its composition includes denser materials, particularly in its core. As a result, the surface rock (item B) is much lighter than the Earth as a whole (item A)."},{"question":"Write a question about the following article: There were 4,280 households of which 32.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.2% were married couples living together, 16.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 38.7% were non-families. 32.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 14% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Разнообразие полиэстеров широко используется в промышленности, в частности в производстве текстиля, пленок, резины, пластиков, стекловолокна, фотографических и ксерографических материалов. Он также является основным компонентом в производстве сверхпрочных материалов, таких как кевлар и вектран. В текстильной промышленности, полиэстер является одним из самых популярных синтетических волокон из-за своих преимуществ перед натуральными материалами, такими как хлопок, шерсть и шелк. Полиэстер стал известным на мировом рынке как сильный и удобный материал благодаря его доступности, многофункциональности и прочности. Он устойчив к износу, и его свойства можно легко модифицировать с помощью добавок, что позволяет создавать различные типы тканей, такие как микрофибра, тафта и шиншилла. Преимуществом полиэстера является его устойчивость к усадке, быстрая сушка и способность сохранять форму даже после многократных стирок. В комбинации с натуральными волокнами, он способствует повышению прочности материала. Полиэстер также устойчив к воздействию ультрафиолетовых лучей и стаьк к выгоранию. Тем не менее, у полиэстера есть некоторые недостатки. В отличие от натуральных волокон, полиэстер плохо проводит воздух, что может привести к дискомфорту при использовании этой ткани в жаркую погоду. Он также представляет определенные экологические проблемы связанные с использованием не возобновляемых ископаемых углеводородов, таких как нефть, для производства полимеров, а также микропластиками, которые могут попасть в окружающую среду и водные ресурсы в процессе стирки. В заключение, хотя полиэстер имеет множество преимуществ для производства текстиля и других продуктов, важно помнить о его возможных недостатках и экологическом воздействии. В частности, потребители должны знать о разнице между полиэстером и биоразлагаемыми альтернативами, а также о том, как использовать и утилизировать продукты из полиэстера наиболее эффективно и экологически безопасно."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"The BeiDou-2 system began offering services for the Asia-Pacific region in December 2012.

The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other... contains an answer for the question: How many species of fish are in the river that's main stem is 187 miles long and its tributaries?, what is it ?

The main stem of the Willamette River is 187 miles (301 km) long, and it flows entirely within northwestern Oregon in the United States. Despite the presence of dams and other man-made structures, the river and its tributaries continue to provide a habitat for a diverse range of fish species, including many types of salmon and trout."},{"question":"Next question: who played dallas in the 1986 movie stagecoach?","response":"The 1986 television movie \\"Stagecoach\\" is a Western film directed by Ted Post and is a remake of the classic 1939 film by the same name, originally directed by John Ford.

A pair of researchers at the University of Texas showed that the supposedly anonymized data released for the contest, which included movie recommendations and choices made by hundreds of thousands of customers, could in fact be used to identify them. That brought the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, and also drew a lawsuit from KamberLaw L.L.C. On Friday, bowing to privacy concerns, Netflix said it was shelving its plans for a sequel to the first contest. In a post on a company blog, Neil Hunt, Netflix’s chief product officer, explained that the company had “reached an understanding” with the F.T.C. and settled the lawsuit. “The resolution of both matters involves certain parameters on how we use Netflix data in any future research programs,” he said. Netflix, Mr. Hunt wrote, will continue to “explore ways to collaborate with the research community” to improve its recommendation system. The three-year competition for the first Netflix Prize, which began in 2006, offered 1 million to the first group that could improve the predictive accuracy of the company’s movie recommendation software by at least 10 percent. A seven-person team, led by two current and one former employee of AT&T Labs, won the contest. Summary:","response":"Netflix had to cancel its 1 million contest aimed at finding the best method to improve its movie recommendations system due to privacy concerns. The contest involved allowing computer scientists and statisticians to dig through Netflix's video rental data, which was supposed to be anonymized. However, researchers from the University of Texas discovered that the data could be used to identify individual customers. This led to scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and a lawsuit from KamberLaw LLC. Netflix then decided to shelve its plans for a follow-up contest. Despite canceling the contest, the company still intends to collaborate with the research community to enhance its recommendation system. The original contest, which began in 2006, was won by a team led by current and former employees of AT&T Labs."},{"question":"Teacher:This task is to translate a news commentary given in Dutch language into Portuguese language.

The earthquake struck 37 miles from the port city of Iquique, at a depth of 12.4 miles below ground. It was initially measured at 7.0 on the Richter scale, which was later revised to 6.7. Worse in Chile: 100,000 people were ordered to higher ground in the wake of the first Chile tremor on Sunday evening. Meanwhile, in Chile: This map, released by the U.S. Geological Survey, shows the point off the Chilean coast where their 6.7 mag earthquake happened Sunday evening. It caused the Chilean Navy to issue an evacuation order in case of a tsunami, though the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said they were not expecting one. The ONEMI emergency office said that preliminarily no damage or injuries had been reported. Nobody seems to have been injured by the quake. Chile's massive copper mines mines, clustered in the mineral-rich North, appeared unscathed.

The album featured Lewis's hit \\"High School Confidential\\", but producer Sam Phillips did not include Lewis's bigger hits such as \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On.\\" The album is sometimes referred to as \\"High School Confidential\\". Can we draw the following conclusion? jerry lee lewis was the first album by jerry lee lewis","response":"It is accurate to conclude that \\"Jerry Lee Lewis\\" was indeed the first album released by the renowned American musician, singer, and songwriter, Jerry Lee Lewis. This debut record was released in 1958 and marked the beginning of his long-lasting, successful career in the rock and roll industry. The creator of this eponymous album, also known as \\"High School Confidential\\", has shaped the way for future generations of rock and roll artists and has solidified his place as a pioneer in the genre. Born in Ferriday, Louisiana, in 1935, Jerry Lee Lewis showed an early interest in music and taught himself how to play the piano at a young age. In his teenage years, he was influenced by both blues and southern gospel music, leading him to develop his unique style. His true breakthrough came when he signed a contract with Sun Records in 1956, which was a pivotal moment in his life. Under the guidance of legendary producer Sam Phillips, Lewis began to create his distinct brand of music, firmly establishing himself in the world of rock and roll. The debut album, \\"Jerry Lee Lewis\\", is a collection of tracks that showcases the undeniable talent and potential of the young singer and songwriter. The album's opening track, \\"Don't Be Cruel,\\" perfectly encapsulates Lewis's unique blend of rock and roll, honky-tonk, and country music. Other key tracks include \\"High School Confidential,\\" which is not only the most well-known song on the album, but it also reached number 21 on the Billboard pop chart, demonstrating the widespread appeal and impact of his music. Interestingly, as the original prompt stated, the record did not feature some of Lewis's most iconic hits, such as \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On,\\" both of which were released as singles prior to the album. This decision by both Lewis and Sam Phillips led some critics and fans to view the debut album as somewhat of an incomplete representation of the artist's early work and meteoric rise to fame. However, it does not detract from the overall significance and legacy of the album in the annals of music history. As the first album released by Jerry Lee Lewis, \\"Jerry Lee Lewis\\" (1958) is not only a testament to his incredible musical abilities but also a milestone moment in the history of rock and roll. With a career spanning over six decades, Jerry Lee Lewis has released numerous studio albums, live albums, and compilations, further solidifying his status as a legend in the music industry. Nevertheless, it is his debut album that marked the beginning of his extraordinary journey and undoubtedly paved the way for future icons of rock and roll."},{"question":"Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

Study A explained how increased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. On the other hand, study B showed how decreased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. Rob found the studies very interesting. Would study B see less or more wildlife population than study A? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. A:","response":"Given the information provided, we can infer that Study A discusses the effects of increased greenhouse gases on climate change, which is closely associated with global warming. This warming leads to the extinction of natural habitats and a reduction in wildlife population. In contrast, Study B examines the effects of decreased greenhouse gases on climate change. Since decreased greenhouse gases would likely result in reduced warming compared to increased greenhouse gases, it can be inferred that Study B would see less adverse effects on natural habitats and as a consequence, likely maintain a higher wildlife population than Study A. In summary, Study B is expected to have a comparatively higher wildlife population than Study A due to the reduced impact of greenhouse gases on climate change, resulting in less habitat destruction and a lower rate of species extinctions."},{"question":"Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

The next important date in the history of photography was in 1837.That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading-room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. The kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travellers brought back wonderful photos from all round the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, photography was developed . Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of film and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.Mathew Brady was a famous American photographer. He took many pictures of great people. The pictures were unusual because they were very lifelike . Photographers also became one kind of art by the end of the 19th century.

Article: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \\"disturbing schools\\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \\"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline.

You can never get more work out of a machine than you put into it. In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine. That’s because a machine must use some of the work put into it to overcome friction. Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines involve motion, so they all have friction. How much work is needed to overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efficiency. During the summer Anthony found it was way too hot to be comfortable. He went out to his garage to get an old fan. The fan was spins on a metal bearing but because it is old it was slightly rusted. When he turned the fan on it spun very slow, struggling to move. He then decided to lubricate the bearing that rotates the fan blades and the fan started spinning normally. Will reducing the friction in a machine make the machine require more or less work? A:","response":"Reducing the friction in a machine will make the machine require less work. When friction is reduced, less work is needed to overcome the force that opposes motion, which allows the machine to work more efficiently.

Question: Why might some graduates choose not to be attending school later in life? Options: A. detention B. stupidity C. overwhelmed D. dropping out E. much work A:","response":"Some graduates might choose not to attend school later in life primarily due to factors such as being overwhelmed or having too much work (options C and E). I will elaborate more on these reasons, but it is important to note that each individual's circumstances may vary, and there could be a combination of factors at play. C. Overwhelmed: As students progress through their academic careers, the demands of higher education can be increasingly challenging. The workload, social pressures, and balancing personal duties with academic responsibilities can lead to some graduates feeling overwhelmed. Moreover, they might face the harsh reality of student loans, which puts additional pressure on them to quickly find employment or a means of supporting themselves after graduation. In these cases, the stress and anxiety of continuing with formal education might deter them from pursuing further studies or entering graduate school later in life. E. Much Work: Upon graduation, some individuals may find themselves delving into the job market or joining family businesses. They may be fortunate enough to land well-paying or fulfilling jobs that align with their skills, values, and interests. In such situations, they may prioritize their careers over returning to academia, as they perceive it as a better investment of their time and resources. Additionally, graduates who have entered the workforce may find it difficult to maintain a work-life balance. The demands of their jobs, coupled with personal and family commitments, could make it challenging—or even impossible—for them to dedicate the time and energy required to attend school later in life. In this sense, much work and other responsibilities can be a significant barrier to their pursuit of further education. In conclusion, though each individual's motivations and circumstances may differ, being overwhelmed and having too much work are common reasons some graduates might choose not to attend school later in life. These factors, along with other personal and professional commitments, can contribute to a decision to prioritize other aspects of life over continuing education."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given triplets.

Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, this information is most likely about Isidore II of Constantinople, who was the Archbishop of Constantinople and the Ecumenical Patriarch from June 1463 until August 1464. Isidore II succeeded Gennadius Scholarius, who was a notable theologian and philosopher, and played an essential role in uniting the Latin and Greek churches in the Council of Florence. The mentioned chronology aligns with the historically recorded events, with Isidore II's term lasting over a year between June 1463 and August 1464. As the Archbishop of Constantinople, Isidore II was the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Church of Constantinople was the primary religious institution in the Byzantine Empire. The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is an essential figure in the Orthodox Church, serving as the first among equals in a hierarchy of bishops and the spiritual leader of millions of faithful Orthodox Christians worldwide. During the time of Isidore II, the Eastern Orthodox Church faced tremendous challenges, including the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. However, Isidore II and his predecessor, Gennadius Scholarius, worked tirelessly to ensure the survival and continuity of the Orthodox faith in Constantinople and the greater Byzantine Empire.

In the autumn of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\\"Young France\\"). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected Jean Cocteau's 1918 Le coq et l'arlequin in favour of a \\"living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness\\". Messiaen's career soon departed from this polemical phase. A:","response":"The answer to the question \\"Whose nickname was Mi?\\" from the given article is: Mi was the affectionate nickname that Olivier Messiaen, a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, had for his wife Claire Delbos.

A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

More and more Americans express frustration and disillusionment today with the political institutions that govern the nation. They clamor for an alternative to the incestuous and pernicious atmosphere dominating the capital. They see a vast array of lobbyists, elected officials and entrenched interests manipulating the levers of power for their own enrichment at the expense of ordinary citizens. The discontent isn’t confined by ideology or political philosophy. As Donald Trump confounded the pundit class in ignoring convention and protocol on his way to securing the Republican presidential nomination, a long-time socialist generated throngs of enthusiastic supporters on the left and almost derailed the Democratic coronation of Hillary Clinton. “Change is in the air,” activist Marianne Williamson wrote, “as old patterns fall away and new energies are emerging.” And so it is. History tells us that agents for reform often generate fear and alarm among those intent on preserving their cushy sinecures. It’s hardly a shock, then, that the 2016 campaign has produced a barrage of unceasing vitriol directed toward Mr. Trump. But let us not be distracted by the social media sideshows and carnival clatter. Substantive issues are in play this November. Our allies on the world stage watch nervously as America retreats from its position of strong leadership leaving strife and conflict rushing to fill the void. The past eight years have pushed us 20 trillion into debt, obligations that will burden our children and grandchildren. The nation’s economy sputters under the growing weight of federal edicts and regulations that smother growth and innovation. Obamacare threatens to crash and burn. The middle class struggles. An administration promising hope and unity instead brought division. Yet Hillary Clinton promises to lead us down the same path. She’ll cuddle up to the ways and perks of Washington like she would to a cozy old blanket. Mr. Trump instead brings a corporate sensibility and a steadfast determination to an ossified Beltway culture. He advocates for lower taxes and a simplified tax code, in contrast to his opponent’s plan to extract another 1 trillion from the private economy in order to enlarge the bureaucracy. Mr. Trump understands and appreciates the conditions that lead to prosperity and job creation and would be a friend to small business and entrepreneurship. Mrs. Clinton has spent most of her adult life on the public payroll. Of particular importance is the U.S. Supreme Court. The next president may be charged with filling multiple vacancies, shaping the court’s direction for a generation. Mr. Trump prefers nominees who recognize the Constitution’s checks on federal authority as a bulwark against tyranny. Mrs. Clinton would be a disaster in this regard. Protections enshrined in no fewer than five amendments in the Bill of Rights could be eliminated or diminished under a progressive high court. Mrs. Clinton has already expressed support for empowering censors to regulate political speech — and even ban movies and books — by rewriting the First Amendment under the guise of campaign finance reform. Count on this to be a litmus test for her high-court nominees. Expect the Second Amendment to fare no better. The individual right to bear arms would be a likely casualty of a Clinton presidency. In addition, it’s not hard to envision a liberal court further eroding the Fifth Amendment’s restrictions on government confiscation of private property and simply pulling the plug on the Ninth and 10th amendments, which have long been on life support. Make no mistake, a Hillary Clinton administration would indulge the worst instincts of the authoritarian left and continue to swell the bloated regulatory state while running the nation deeper into the red in pursuit of “free” college and health care. Yes, Mr. Trump’s impulsiveness and overheated rhetoric alienate many voters. He has trouble dealing with critics and would be wise to discover the power of humility. But neither candidate will ever be called to the dais to accept an award for moral probity and character. And we are already distressingly familiar with the Clinton way, which involves turning public service into an orgy of influence peddling and entitlement designed to line their own pockets — precisely what a disgruntled electorate now rises up to protest. Mr. Trump represents neither the danger his critics claim nor the magic elixir many of his supporters crave. But he promises to be a source of disruption and discomfort to the privileged, back-scratching political elites for whom the nation’s strength and solvency have become subservient to power’s pursuit and preservation. Donald Trump for president. ||||| Photo With polls showing him sliding nationally, Donald J. Trump received a bit of welcome news on Sunday in one battleground state as the editorial page of Nevada’s largest newspaper, The Las Vegas Review-Journal, endorsed him for president. It is the first major newspaper to give Mr. Trump its blessing, though it may come with something of an asterisk: The Review-Journal was bought late last year by the casino magnate and billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a Trump supporter and longtime Republican benefactor. The editorial described Mr. Trump as flawed but nonetheless preferable to Hillary Clinton. “Mr. Trump’s impulsiveness and overheated rhetoric alienate many voters,” its endorsement said. “He has trouble dealing with critics and would be wise to discover the power of humility.” “But neither candidate will ever be called to the dais to accept an award for moral probity and character,” the editorial continued. “And we are already distressingly familiar with the Clinton way, which involves turning public service into an orgy of influence peddling and entitlement designed to line their own pockets — precisely what a disgruntled electorate now rises up to protest.” Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The editorial warned that an administration led by Mrs. Clinton “would indulge the worst instincts of the authoritarian left and continue to swell the bloated regulatory state while running the nation deeper into the red in pursuit of ‘free’ college and health care.” The endorsement comes at a time when Mr. Trump is in growing need of support: An ABC News tracking poll released on Sunday showed Mrs. Clinton beating him nationally by 12 percentage points.

The Dallas Morning News editorial page gave her its first endorsement of a Democrat since 1940. And The Cincinnati Enquirer, whose editorial page also endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said that the last Democrat to receive its endorsement was Woodrow Wilson. Until Sunday, the biggest newspapers to endorse Mr. Trump were the Santa Barbara, Calif., News-Press and St. Joseph, Mo., News-Press. The Review-Journal’s editorial page rejected what it suggested was overwrought fear-mongering about Mr. Trump. “Mr. Trump represents neither the danger his critics claim nor the magic elixir many of his supporters crave,” the endorsement said. “But he promises to be a source of disruption and discomfort to the privileged, back-scratching political elites for whom the nation’s strength and solvency have become subservient to power’s pursuit and preservation.” ||||| Donald Trump picked up his first major newspaper endorsement of the November election over the weekend when the Las Vegas Review-Journal became one of the few to back the Republican nominee. “These are turbulent times,” the newspaper, which is owned by Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, said in an editorial. “More and more Americans express frustration and disillusionment today with the political institutions that govern the nation.

Last week, the Santa Barbara News-Press and St. Joseph News-Press became the first two since the primary season to back the brash billionaire.

Related: Right-leaning newspapers bail on Trump On Sunday, she picked up another: the Cedar Rapids Gazette, which hasn’t endorsed a Democrat for president since 1964. “Do not throw up your hands and say the game is rigged,” the Gazette said while arguing against Trump. “Do not put your faith in a candidate who has proved in business and his personal life that he does not have a long-term strategy; that he cannot hold his temper; that he has utter disregard for the common good; that he lacks the basic understanding of governance, public service or what many of us would consider common decency.” Unsurprisingly, Clinton also grabbed the endorsement of the New Yorker magazine on Sunday.

(CNN) -- Three attacks were made on Royal Dutch Shell oil facilities in Nigeria on Sunday, according to a company spokesman who said details were not immediately available. Investigating the attacks will be difficult because they happened in remote areas, Royal Dutch Shell says. The attacks were against pipelines in the eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, said the spokesman, Rainer Winzenried. \\"Shell is investigating the impact on facilities, the environment and the production capabilities,\\" he said.

Every day for sixty million years, seabirds have performed mind-boggling acts of derring-do: circumnavigating the globe without rest, diving more than 200 meters in treacherous seas for a bite of lunch, braving the most unpredictable weather on the planet as if it were just another Tuesday and finding their way home in waters with few, if any, landmarks. But now seabirds, like so many other species, may have met their match. Conservationists have long known that many seabird populations are in decline, but a recent paper in PLOS ONE finds the situation worse than anticipated. According to the researchers, seabird abundance has dropped 69.7% in just 60 years – representing the deaths of some 230 million animals. “I was very surprised with the result, it was considerably greater than I’d expected,” said Edd Hammill, co-author of the paper, with Utah State University. “What we should take away from this is that something is serious amiss in the oceans.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Brown Booby (Sula leucogaster) is listed as Least Concern and is found throughout the pantropical oceans. However some populations are suspected to be in decline owing to disturbance and unsustainable levels of exploitation. Photograph: Ben Lascelles/Birdlife International Ben Lascelles, a Senior Marine Officer with Birdlife International, who was not involved in the study, said he found the research alarming because the decline appeared practically indiscriminate, hitting a “large number of species across a number of families.” Seabirds, which include any bird that depends largely on the marine environment, comprise nearly 350 species worldwide – an astonishing variety of extreme-loving birds. For example, the indefatigable wandering albatross, which sports the largest wingspan on the planet; the child-sized Emperor penguin, the only bird that breeds during the Antarctic winter; and the tiny storm petrel that practically capers on the water as it feeds – they are named for St. Peter after all. But, given that seabirds inhabit both the open ocean and the shoreline, this eclectic mix of birds faces a litany of threats: overfishing, drowning in fishing lines or nets, plastic pollution, invasive species like rats in nesting areas, oil and gas development and toxic pollution moving up the food chain. And as if these weren’t enough, the double-whammy of climate change and ocean acidification threatens to flood nesting sites and disrupt food sources. “Seabirds are particularly good indicators of the health of marine ecosystems,” explained lead author, Michelle Paleczny with the University of British Columbia and the Sea Around Us Project. “When we see this magnitude of seabird decline, we can see there is something wrong with marine ecosystems. It gives us an idea of the overall impact we’re having.” Bu with such a large number of species across such a wide variety of environment one is left asking: how did the scientists count so many birds? Counting Birds First, the team of researchers scoured all the population data on seabirds available. They found demographic data on 3,213 populations. But they couldn’t use all of theses counts, since conservationists had surveyed many of these far-flung populations just once or twice – not enough to show a real trend The team eventually selected 513 populations that had been counted at least five times. In all, these populations represented about 19 percent of the world’s seabirds. Still, Hammil said he believes the team’s findings “are an accurate representation of what is happening worldwide.” He added, “although we did not include every population, all seabird families were included, and we included populations from every major coastline in the world.” Paleczny also said that when the researchers looked at the differences between monitored and unmonitored populations, they saw “no evidence that the monitored populations are declining more.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Near Threatened Black-footed Albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) is a species at risk of accidental bycatch in fisheries of the North Pacific. However, simple mitigation measures have proved to be very effective at keeping seabirds off the hooks. Photograph: Ben Lascelles/Birdlife International The findings are also bolstered by past research. In 2012 a paper in Bird Conservation International found that 28 percent of seabird species are threatened with extinction with 47 percent in decline. This meant, in all, seabirds were about twice as likely as land-based birds to be threatened with extinction. “The trends for many seabird species have clearly been downwards for a number of years, and this paper provides further evidence of this,” Lascelles said. Still, Paleczny and Hammil’s research arguably paints an even more alarming picture of the state of the world’s seabirds. For example, according to them, the tern family has fallen by 85%, frigatebirds by 81%, petrels and shearwaters by 79%, and albatrosses by 69%. Such dismal findings point to one of the study’s patterns: open ocean birds – such as albatrosses, frigatebirds, petrels and shearwaters – are generally faring worse than birds that stick near the coasts. “[Open-ocean] seabirds are hit especially hard due to their large geographic ranges. Because these species travel so far, there is a greater chance they will encounter threats,” said Hammill who noted that coastal birds “in some cases” are doing better because of improved management of breeding areas and improved fishing gear. But even when threats were minimised, Lascelles noted that recovery requires diligence and patience. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A gannet grabs a fish by its beak, 2014, in Shetland, Scotland. Gannets, and other seabirds, depend on abundant fish populations to survive. Photograph: Richard Shucksmith/BarcroftMedia “Most seabirds are long-lived and slow reproducing, this means even quite small increases in mortality can lead to significant population declines, which they take a long time to recover from.” And even some widely-dispersed coastal birds are undergoing heavy declines. For example, the study found that cormorant and shag populations have fallen by 73%. Going Forward Given all the threats facing the world’s seabirds, it’s fair to ask: where do we start when it comes to conservation? “We already have solutions to many of the threats...it’s just they need scaling up and implementing across industries and geographies,” Lascelles said. “Increased efforts should be made to rid seabird colonies of invasive species, reduce bycatch in fisheries or the ensnaring of birds in fish nets, and setting up conservation areas.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Laysan Albatross adult and chick on nest dwarfed by pile of marine debris collected on Midway Atoll coast by volunteers.

Photograph: Alamy Paleczny also called for the creation of international marine protected areas to cover the wide ranges of seabirds. Protected areas in the oceans lag far behind those on land. Currently, only 2% of the world’s oceans are under some form of protection and less than half of those ban fishing altogether. In contrast, nearly 15% of the world’s terrestrial landscape is protected. With so little of the ocean theoretically closed to fisheries – less than 1% – it’s hardly shocking that many seabirds are suffering from overfishing. Indeed, an illuminating study from 2012 found that whenever fish abundance dropped below one-third of maximum levels, seabird populations began to fall in response. “What this is saying is that [seabirds] have evolved to exploit average to above-average feeding conditions,” co-author Ian Boyd told Mongabay in 2012. “This isn’t really very surprising, but some things don’t become obvious until the evidence is right in front of you.” At the time, Boyd said their findings should result in a new campaign to save “one third for the birds” (and other marine predators) from the world’s fisheries. But to Hammill the “most pressing issue” is plastic pollution. Long neglected by environmentalists – perhaps due to the intractability of the problem – the issue of plastic pollution in the oceans has been slowly getting more notice. A paper released last month found that 90% of the world’s seabirds likely have plastic in their stomachs. “I have seen everything from cigarette lighters...to bottle caps to model cars. I’ve found toys [inside seabird guts],” co-author Denise Hardesty, with CSIRO, told the Associated Press. Up to 90% of seabirds have plastic in their guts, study finds Read more Seabirds continually mistake plastic for fish eggs, devouring large amounts. Plastic in animals’ stomachs not only release deadly toxins, but can also lead to slow starvation by obstructing the animals’ bowels. Birds even feed plastic bits to their young, killing their fledglings en masse. In the end, large-scale actions to help seabirds could also go a long way in cleaning-up our increasingly trashed marine ecosystems. “The oceans are still woefully under protected and fisheries need greater management and enforcement. All of these activities need investment and support of governments around the world to make them happen,” Lascelles said. “These actions will build resilience in the seabird populations in the short term, which they need in the face of emerging threats such as climate change.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest No other bird breeds further south than the Near Threatened Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae).

However a number of simple mitigation measures are available, and where they have been implemented the reduction in bycatch has been dramatic. Photograph: Ben Lascelles/Birdlife International ||||| Consider the albatross. A bird that mates for life and flies over 6,000 miles for food, the albatross has seen profound population declines over the past several decades. It appears now as though a harbinger for its own demise. Or take the Fiji petrel, a black, tube-nosed bird that spends almost its entire life skimming the oceans. The petrel, the albatross and other birds suffer when the oceans are polluted and overfished and a new study in PLOS One suggests they are paying a heavy price. Since the 1950s, the study concludes that seabird numbers have dropped by nearly 70 percent. \\"Seabirds are particularly good indicators of the health of marine ecosystems,\\" said University of British Columbia's Michelle Paleczny, a co-author of the study and a researcher with the Sea Around Us project. \\"When we see this magnitude of seabird decline, we can see there is something wrong with marine ecosystems. It gives us an idea of the overall impact we're having.\\" Daniel Donnecke For the study, the researchers compiled information on more than 500 seabird populations from around the world, representing 19 percent of the global seabird population. They found overall populations had declined by 69.6 percent or the equivalent to a loss of about 230 million birds in 60 years. Some of worst drops were in the Southern Hemisphere, which includes Australia, Antarctica, most of South America and a third of Africa. Among the families hardest hit have been Sternidea, which includes terns and saw declines of 85.8 percent. That was followed by Frigatidae, a family which includes frigatebirds and saw declines of 81.7 percent. Then there was Procellariidae, a family that includes petrels and saw declines of 79.6 percent and Phalacrocoracida, a group that includes cormorants and shags, saw drops of 73.6 percent. The family of Diomedeidae, which includes albatross, saw declines of 69 percent. \\"We are seeing a serious and worrying decline,\\" said Rory Crawford, a senior policy officer with BirdLife International's marine Programme, which in 2012 estimated that nearly half of seabird populations were in trouble. Daniel Donnecke \\"It's a large number of species across a number of families that are in decline and that is alarming,\\" he said. \\"This is not about going to one location. It's about a broad range of threats effecting sea birds.\\" The study concluded that the dramatic declines were caused by a range of factors, including overfishing of the fish seabirds rely on for food. Hundreds of thousands of birds each year get tangled in fishing gear and die or are sickened by oil spills or plastic pollution. They also face threats to their colonies from invasive predators such as rats that feast on their eggs. Other factors include destruction and changes to seabird habitat as well as the environmental and ecological changes caused by climate change. They are especially vulnerable because of their dependence of a wide swath of open water for food, traveling the world's oceans to forage for food and returning to the same colonies to breed. George Wallace, vice president for oceans and islands at the American Bird Conservancy, said the impacts especially on long-distance fliers like the petrels and shearwaters shows just how much \\"humans have altered the planet.\\" Sea Around Us \\"They may be responding to oceanic conditions that are thousands of miles from their breeding colonies,\\" he said. \\"If you are a Hawaiian petrel that undertakes a foraging flight that literally takes up most of the northern Pacific Ocean and you don't find food, that is a tremendous exertion of energy and a chick that won't be fed.\\" A big part of the problem, Paleczny said, was the absence of efforts to protect many of these birds. \\"Our work demonstrates the strong need for increased seabird conservation effort internationally,\\" Paleczny said. \\"Loss of seabirds causes a variety of impacts in coastal and marine ecosystems.\\" Crawford agreed, saying increased efforts should be made to rid seabird colonies of invasive species, reduce bycatch, or the ensnaring of birds in fish nets, and setting up conservation areas for all aspects of the birds' life cycles from breeding sites to migratory routes. \\"There are things we can do. What we need is investment and support of governments around the world to make this happen,\\" Crawford said. \\"These actions will build resilience in the seabird populations in the short term, which they need in the face of climate change.\\" In a sign of hope, some bird populations have increased their numbers. A group called Hydrobatidae, which includes storm petrels, saw its numbers rise more than 45 percent while the family of Alcidae, which includes puffins and murres, climbed 9.1 percent. The researchers didn't explain why some groups appeared to be thriving or whether this reflected all species within the groups, although it could be attributed to successful efforts to rid several Pacific islands of cats, rats and other invasive species. And in another conservation success, Birdlife recently worked with fishermen in South Africa to reduce bycatch by 99 percent and thus give a boost to the albatross. \\"What I'm encouraged about is that we know what the solutions are,\\" Crawford said. \\"We know the seabirds will respond spectacularly well if we remove invasive species from their breeding colonies. We know that we can reduce seabird bycatch in fisheries with simply measures that are not costly and don't affect the efficiencies of the fishery operation.\\" ||||| Seabird population changes are good indicators of long-term and large-scale change in marine ecosystems, and important because of their many impacts on marine ecosystems. We assessed the population trend of the world’s monitored seabirds (1950–2010) by compiling a global database of seabird population size records and applying multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) modeling to estimate the overall population trend of the portion of the population with sufficient data (i.e., at least five records). This monitored population represented approximately 19% of the global seabird population. We found the monitored portion of the global seabird population to have declined overall by 69.7% between 1950 and 2010. This declining trend may reflect the global seabird population trend, given the large and apparently representative sample. Furthermore, the largest declines were observed in families containing wide-ranging pelagic species, suggesting that pan-global populations may be more at risk than shorter-ranging coastal populations. Despite the global importance of seabirds, both to marine ecosystems and as indicators of marine ecosystem status, analysis of their population trends is typically limited to the relatively small spatial and temporal scales at which data are collected. The only global assessment of seabird population status, based on extinction risk as assessed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, indicates that one third of seabird species are threatened with extinction, one half are known or suspected to be in decline, and at least four species are extinct [ 12 ]. Seabird population changes are good indicators of long-term and large-scale change in marine ecosystems because seabird populations are relatively well-monitored, their ecology allows them to integrate long-term and large-scale signals (they are long-lived, wide-ranging and forage at high trophic levels) [ 10 – 11 ], and their populations are strongly influenced by threats to marine and coastal ecosystems. These threats include entanglement in fishing gear, overfishing of food sources, climate change, pollution, disturbance, direct exploitation, development, energy production, and introduced species (predators such as rats and cats introduced to breeding islands that were historically free of land-based predators) [ 12 ]. Knowledge of changes in seabird populations is also inherently important because seabirds play important roles in island and marine ecosystem processes, function and resilience, by acting as predators, scavengers, cross-ecosystem nutrient subsidizers, and ecosystem engineers [ 2 , 13 – 16 ]. In order for the trend estimated for the monitored population to be representative of the global population, the monitored sub-sample would have to be representative of the global population, so we would expect the taxonomic diversity and spatial distribution of the monitored populations to be diverse and reflective of the overall global population. To assess this, we compared the monitored populations (i.e., those 513 populations with >4 records) and the unmonitored populations (i.e., those 2696 populations with 1–4 records) the diversity and representativeness of taxa, marine regions, declining populations, and missing populations (i.e., populations with no records). In the Eqs 1 and 2 , x is a m*T matrix representing the state of the random variable X t at each time t. The parameter w is a m*T matrix of the process errors at time t, with a mean 0 and covariance matrix Q t . Parameter y represents a n*T matrix of the observation, some of which may be missing. v is a n*T column vector of the non-process errors, the observation errors at t and multivariate and normal with mean 0, and covariance matrix R t . u and a are parameters. As each of the seabird populations was reproductively and often geographically isolated, we assumed they had independent random errors (diagonal Q matrix) and had different population parameters (u and a). As the population census data were collected by different groups utilizing different techniques (even within the same population), and some species are easier to detect than others, we stipulated independent observation variances for each population (diagonal and unequal R matrix). However, much of the variation in process error may be the result of environmental, rather than demographic stochasticity, meaning that populations may show similar trends and the assumption of independent process error is invalid. We therefore tested the assumptions of independence by running subsequent versions of the MARSS model where process and measurement errors were set as equal for each population. We used maximum likelihood with an Expectation-Maximum algorithm to estimate population trends as an auto-regressive stochastic process for all populations that had at least five records in their time-series (a prerequisite). These 513 of the total 3213 populations ( S1 Table ) are hereafter referred to as the monitored portion of the global seabird population. MARSS models provide an estimate of the population size in the years when no survey was conducted. Using this technique we were then able to obtain population estimates for all of the 513 monitored populations between the years 1950–2010. To represent the overall trajectory of monitored seabird populations, we summed the estimated number of seabirds, and their standard errors across all populations for each year, and plotted the trajectory. To understand how the fixed parameters (u and a) contributed to the population trajectory compared to the random variances (Q and R), we calculated the size of Q and R as a proportion of u and a. We obtained data from primary sources including journal articles, books, and unpublished reports. We obtained population sizes as breeding pairs or total population; for comparison between the two, we converted records reported in breeding pairs to total population assuming that the population includes 30% non-breeders, a commonly assumed estimate for global seabird studies [ 18 – 20 ]. If a population size was reported as a range (e.g., 100–200 breeding pairs), we assumed the population size to be the geometric mean of the minimum and maximum records; the geometric mean is the square root of the product of a pair of values, and is applied in ecology to approximate central tendency [ 21 ]. For an example of the population database contents, see S3 Table . The database derived from our study is maintained by the Sea Around Us Project and will be made publicly available at www.seaaroundus.org . The monitored population, in comparison with the unmonitored population, contained a slightly higher percentage of declining populations, but also a higher percentage of increasing populations. Based on available data and methods described above, overall decline was detected in 38% of the monitored populations and 27% of the unmonitored populations, increase was detected in 61% of monitored populations and 29% of unmonitored populations, and no change was detected in 1% of monitored populations and 44% of unmonitored populations (the latter is due to the high number of populations with only one population record). Threatened species (i.e., status of Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List) comprised 26% of monitored species; this percentage is slightly lower than that across all of the world’s species (i.e., 28%) [ 12 ]. The taxonomic diversity of the monitored population was high, but not reflective of the taxonomic composition of the global seabird population. Half of all seabird species (i.e., 162 of 324) were represented in the monitored portion of the population ( S1 Table ). The extent to which each species was monitored varied; 17% of monitored species had 100% of their populations monitored, and 43% of species had at least 50% of their populations monitored. Thirteen families (i.e., all except Pelecanoididae) were represented in the monitored portion of the global seabird population ( Fig 3 ). The extent to which each family was monitored varied from 1–5% (Hydrobatidae, Fregatidae, Phaethontidae, Stercorariidae), 12–20% (Procellariidae, Sternidae, Alcidae), 34–44% (Laridae, Sulidae), 54–59% (Phalacrocoracidae, Pelecanidae, Spheniscidae), and 89% (Diomedeidae). Of the seven numerically abundant seabird families that together account for approximately 97% of the global seabird population (Procellariidae, Alcidae, Sternidae, Spheniscidae, Pelecanoididae, Hydrobatidae, Laridae), two were poorly represented (Pelecanoididae and Hydrobatidae, jointly accounting for <1% of the monitored population) while the remaining five families were relatively well represented (jointly accounting for 92% of the monitored population). We found considerable differences in the population trajectories of different families over time. Of the monitored populations, we found overall increases in Alcidae (9.1%), Hydrobatidae (45.4%), and Sulidae (1.1%), and decreases in Diomedeidae (69.0%) Frigatidae (81.7%), Pelecanidae (35.3%), Laridae (17.4%), Phaethontidae (25.8%), Phalacrocoracidae (73.6%), Procellariidae (79.6%), Spheniscidae (32.3%), Stercorariidae (65.4%), Sternidae (85.8%). When Q and R matrices were set as diagonal and unequal (independent process and non-process errors used for each population), MARSS modeling revealed a substantial decline in seabird populations throughout the modern industrial era. This decline represented a 69.7% loss between 1950 and 2010, in the monitored portion of the global seabird population ( Fig 2 ). The overall value of u across all populations was -8868.25, implying that on average, each seabird population lost a considerable number of individuals per year. A substantial proportion of this loss was due to large declines in the five most abundant populations, all located in the southern hemisphere. Between them, the populations of Sooty Terns (Sternidae) from French Polynesia and South Orkney, the South Sandwich Island populations of both Soft-plumaged Petrels and Kerguelen Petrels (both Procellariidae), and the Peruvian population of Guanay Cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae) accounted for over 30% of the total numbers of seabirds in the sampled population in 1950; all of these populations were reduced to less than 5% of their initial size by 2010. Discussion Drivers of a declining trend in the monitored portion of the global seabird population The cause of the estimated overall decline in seabird populations is likely a suite of threatening human activities—introduced species at nesting colonies (e.g., rats, cats), entanglement in fishing gear at sea, overfishing of food sources by humans, climate change and severe weather, pollution, disturbance, direct exploitation (harvesting chicks, eggs, adults), development, and energy production [12]. Some of these threats affect most species across the globe (e.g., climate change is a global process, although some regions will be more detrimentally affected), while others will be more local processes, or impact species disproportionately based on their ecology and/or life-history attributes (e.g., overfishing of food sources has a strong negative impact on seabirds with small body size, specialized diets, energetically expensive foraging, and surface foraging [23]). The impacts of some threats pre-date our seabird population data [24–27] and therefore a potentially large percentage of seabird populations were already suppressed prior to our 1950 baseline. Additionally, exploitation of other marine taxa (e.g., whales, sea otters, fish) has contributed indirectly to changes in seabird populations by altering the quantity, quality and spatial distribution of their prey [28]. While seabird conservation efforts have been successful in reducing mortality of some species in recent decades, for example, banning some direct exploitation [27], eradicating some introduced predators [29], reducing some entanglement in fishing gear [30], these efforts are evidently not sufficient in terms of stopping or reversing large-scale seabird decline, especially as new threats emerge, notably industrial harvesting to food [31]. Throughout the 1950–2010 timeframe of our study, overall threat rates have likely increased alongside growth in human population and industrialization although there may be annual variation in threats and threat response. Relatively low variation was observed in the rate of decline of the monitored population of seabirds throughout the timeframe (Fig 2), perhaps due to the continuous growth and expansion of threats and/or the lack of temporal resolution in available data. Climate oscillations can contribute to patterns in seabird abundance by affecting prey availability [32], although they are not likely the driving cause of the observed decline, as the continuous decline of seabirds over the timeframe of this study does not mirror any known climate oscillations. The interaction of climate cycles with threatening human activities may however be at play; in both Peru and California, depletion of seabird prey by fisheries has contributed to decreased resilience of seabirds to natural climate cycles, resulting in declines under poor climatic conditions and lack of natural rebound under good climatic conditions [33–34]. Global significance of the estimated trend in the monitored portion of the global population Although the monitored portion of the world’s seabirds represents a subsample of the global seabird population, and we therefore cannot be certain the decline we have uncovered represents the pattern for the global seabird population, our relatively large sample suggests that a substantial global decline has occurred. Our findings also correspond with the highly threatened status of many of the world’s seabird species [12]. Investigation of how well our subsample represents the global population revealed no strong bias towards particular taxa, marine regions or declining populations. Half of all seabird species were represented and thirteen of fourteen families were represented. While families were not sampled in proportion to their numerical abundance, there was no apparent bias in sampling related to the proportion of threatened species per family [12]. For example, particularly well-represented families (in absolute and relative terms) include both families containing relatively high percentages of threatened species (Spheniscidae, Procellariidae, Diomedeidae) and relatively low percentages of threatened species (Alcidae, Laridae), while two families with particularly high percentages of threatened species are poorly represented (Hydrobatidae, Pelecanoididae) [12]. Sampling effort was not even across marine regions, but there was no apparent relationship between sampling effort and overall threat intensity across marine regions; of the regions with strongest threatening human activities, some were relatively well-monitored (northeast Atlantic) while others were relatively poorly monitored (Asia) [1]. While the monitored portion in comparison with the unmonitored portion of the global population contained a slightly higher percentage of declining populations, it also contained a much higher percentage of increasing populations (because the unmonitored population had a high number of populations with only one record), and a slightly lower representation of threatened species. A seabird global population estimate derived from our data was similar to an existing global estimate, suggesting that only a small minority of the global seabird population lacks some degree of population monitoring during the timeframe of the study. Overall, the lack of bias observed in the taxa, marine regions, and declining populations in the subsample, in addition to indication that most of the world’s population has been sampled at least once, suggests that the trend observed for the monitored portion of the population may reflect an overall trend in the global seabird population. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"A new study has found that the world's seabird populations have declined by almost 70% in just 60 years, which is worse than initially estimated. The alarming decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including overfishing, ocean plastic pollution, entanglement in fishing gear, invasive species, oil and gas development, and toxic pollution. Seabirds are vital indicators of the health of marine ecosystems, and their decline signifies that there is a serious problem within the world's oceans. Solutions to the issue include increased efforts to remove invasive species from seabird colonies, reducing bycatch in fisheries, and implementing marine conservation areas."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Step 1: Choose a general topic For generating a context and a hypothesis, let's choose a general topic that is relevant and interesting.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More Chicken snakes nest near you happens, how will it affect LESS birds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having more chicken snakes nesting near the area will indeed have effects, both direct and indirect, on the process involving birds, their eggs, and their lifecycle. Chicken snakes, also known as rat snakes, are known for their predatory behavior towards small birds and their eggs. They are quite successful climbers and can easily reach nests that are located high up in the trees. Therefore, the increase in the population of chicken snakes in an area can affect the process of bird reproduction significantly. 1. Direct Effects: The immediate and most obvious effect of an increase in the population of chicken snakes around bird nests is the increased predation of bird eggs and fledgling birds. Chicken snakes are adept at climbing and hunting, thus they can easily access the bird nests. They feed on the eggs, reducing the number of eggs that can potentially hatch into baby birds, causing a significant decrease in the bird population. 2. Indirect Effects: Apart from the direct predation, there are several indirect effects as well. An increase in the population of chicken snakes can cause stress among bird populations. Birds might perceive the area as unsafe for nesting and breeding, hence they might start looking for other areas for nesting, leading to a decrease in the bird population in the affected area. 3. Disruption of life cycle: The increased presence of chicken snakes also disrupts the normal lifecycle of birds. With their eggs under threat, fewer birds reach adulthood, which directly affects their chances of finding a mate. This disrupts another phase in their life cycle: the laying of eggs and the creation of new generations. 4. Alteration of Habitat: If birds start leaving the affected area in search of safer nesting sites, this also results in an alteration of the local habitat. Other species dependent on these birds for their survival could be impacted negatively too, leading to an imbalanced ecosystem. 5. Evoked Defensive Mechanisms: Birds might start developing new defensive mechanisms or strategies in response to the increased snake threat, which could possibly alter their existing lifestyle and behavior. They might build their nests in new unfamiliar areas, leading to more stress and possibly lower survival rates. In conclusion, the increase in the population of chicken snakes near a bird's habitat would decrease the number of birds, as it threatens their survival at various stages, right from the egg to adult stage, thereby disrupting the described process - 'A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs'."},{"question":"Pope John XXIII did not live to see the Vatican Council to completion. He died of stomach cancer on 3 June 1963, four and a half years after his election and two months after the completion of his final and famed encyclical, Pacem in terris. He was buried in the Vatican grottoes beneath Saint Peter's Basilica on 6 June 1963 and his cause for canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by his successor, Pope Paul VI, who declared him a Servant of God. In addition to being named Venerable on 20 December 1999, he was beatified on 3 September 2000 by Pope John Paul II alongside Pope Pius IX and three others. Following his beatification, his body was moved on 3 June 2001 from its original place to the altar of Saint Jerome where it could be seen by the faithful. On 5 July 2013, Pope Francis – bypassing the traditionally required second miracle – declared John XXIII a saint, after unanimous agreement by a consistory, or meeting, of the College of Cardinals, based on the fact that he was considered to have lived a virtuous, model lifestyle, and because of the good for the Church which had come from his having opened the Second Vatican Council. He was canonised alongside Pope Saint John Paul II on 27 April 2014. John XXIII today is affectionately known as the \\"Good Pope\\" and in Italian, \\"il Papa buono\\".

[-] Erin had damaged their new car.","response":"Patricia had damaged their new car. Erin, an ambitious software engineer, had just bought her dream car after years of hard work and dedication. As soon as she laid her eyes on this top-of-the-line Sedan with its sleek black finish and state-of-the-art technology, she knew it was the one. Carefully and meticulously, she had saved penny after penny, only allowing herself this one significant splurge. The day Erin brought her sparkling new car home, her neighbors and friends were in awe as they admired her accomplishment. Patricia, Erin's neighbor and close friend for over a decade, was one of those friends. As a gesture of goodwill, Erin had decided to let Patricia test drive her new car around the block. Little did Erin know that this would turn into one of her biggest regrets. Patricia eagerly hopped into the driver's seat, excited to try out Erin's new car. Though Patricia wasn't a reckless driver, she became easily distracted when inside the vehicle. As she was maneuvering through the neighborhood, showing off her knowledge of the high-tech gadgets, she suddenly heard an alarming \\"CRUNCH\\" sound. Whirling her head, Patricia saw that she had carelessly sideswiped a parked car owned by neighborhood resident Mike, who had caught the entire incident on his security camera. Patricia's heart raced, and her face flushed red with embarrassment. Once back at Erin's house, the two women stepped out of the car, both utterly dismayed by the significant damages. Mike, having seen the event unfold on his camera, approached Erin and Patricia, demanding compensation for his ruined car. Because Erin's car was uninsured, the incident had severe implications on her finances. Patricia, overwhelmed with guilt, apologized profusely to both Erin and Mike, promising to cover the damages but never followed through. Months went by, and Patricia continued to offer platitudes with no actions to back them. The friendship between Patricia and Erin strained over the incident, and Erin found herself struggling with crippling debt that she had not prepared for. Finally, she decided that the only solution was to take legal action against Patricia. Erin filed a lawsuit against Patricia in civil court, seeking restitution for the damages to both her and Mike's vehicle. The aftermath of the car accident had not only left Erin with a damaged car but had severely damaged her trust and friendship with Patricia as well. Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the once-close friends faced off and bore their grievances. Thoroughly reviewing all the evidence, including multiple witness statements and video documentation from Mike's security camera, the judge declared Patricia guilty of willful negligence. The verdict stated that Patricia was required to cover all costs related to the damages caused to both Erin and Mike's cars, including any additional legal fees. Despite winning the case, Erin found herself heartbroken over the loss of her treasured friendship. It seemed that their years of care and laughter had crumbled under the weight of Patricia's negligence and failure to take responsibility for her actions. It was a pyrrhic victory, and the once jubilant friends went their separate ways, lamenting the events that led them to this point. A single incident, one lapse of judgment, led to a series of life-altering consequences for both Patricia and Erin. Not only did it mar their strong friendship, but the incident also saw the destruction of financial security for the protagonists. A testament to the fact that sometimes, a momentary lack of focus can result in a lifetime of regret and consequences."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: In America, after middle school comes high school, which includes grades 9 through 12.

One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short?

After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,... Answer:","response":"Andres Serrano used three bodily fluids for the album cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums. For the Load album cover, Serrano created the artwork titled \\"Blood and Semen III\\" by pressing a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. This visual piece marked a significant change in the band's musical direction and image. For the Reload album cover, Serrano employed a different combination of fluids. In this case, he used a mixture of blood and urine to create the artwork. The Reload album was a follow-up to Load, containing songs that were not included in the previous release. Both album covers showcased Serrano's unique artistic style and played a role in redefining Metallica's image during that period.

The veteran is trying to hide these emotions, implying that they are powerful and possibly vulnerable emotions. Taking these points into consideration, we can eliminate some options: - Whisper: This option doesn't fit the emotional context and seems irrelevant to the situation. - Appreciation: While the veteran might appreciate the museum experience, this option alone doesn't convey the intensity of the emotions described in the situation. - Take pictures: This is an action that might reflect interest or admiration, but it doesn't strongly demonstrate the emotional experience of the veteran in this context. - Feeling proud: While the veteran might feel proud, the context described suggests more intense emotions that the veteran tries to hide, making this choice less likely. We are left with: - Cry: This option appears to fit the context best, as it demonstrates a strong emotional reaction that the veteran is trying to hide. Crying can be connected to revisiting memories or past events that hold emotional significance to the veteran.

The legal dispute arose when the fan-funded production company, Axanar Productions, sought to produce a prequel to the popular Star Trek franchise, which was originally created in 1966 and set in the 23rd century. The prequel was titled \\"Axanar\\" and aimed to tell the story of Garth of Izar, a legendary Federation captain who played an essential role in the defeat of the Klingon Empire during the Four Years War. The issue at hand was the fact that Paramount Pictures and CBS Studios held a copyright over the intellectual property in the Star Trek universe, including but not limited to characters, locations, technology, and even the Klingon language. The Klingon language was developed in the early 1980s by linguist Marc Okrand for use in Star Trek films and TV series. Since its introduction, the Klingon language has gained a considerable fan following, with enthusiasts learning and even creating new words based on its complex and intricate grammar rules. However, Paramount and CBS Studios maintained that they held exclusive rights to the use of the language in commercial productions. In their lawsuit, Paramount and CBS Studios claimed that Axanar Productions was infringing upon their copyright by using the Klingon language, among other elements from the Star Trek universe, without obtaining the necessary license or permission. The studios argued that the unauthorized use of their copyrighted material in a fan-funded production had the potential to cause damage and dilution of their intellectual property value. In response, Axanar Productions argued that the Klingon language, as a \\"useful system,\\" was not protected under copyright law. They maintained that the principles of language, culture, and speech should not be subject to the control and ownership of a private corporation. This counterargument sparked a debate over the extent to which fictional languages can be copyrighted. The case was ultimately settled out of court in January 2017. As a part of the settlement agreement, Axanar Productions agreed to make substantial changes to the script and follow the newly created guidelines by CBS and Paramount for fan films. These guidelines included restrictions, such as limiting the use of copyrighted material and reducing the length of fan films to ensure that they remain true to their non-commercial nature. The Axanar lawsuit not only underscored the importance of adhering to licensing agreements and intellectual property rights but also led to a broader discussion on the copyright status of constructed languages and their place within popular culture."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: 1990 for the following movie plot: On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail. Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather calms down happens, how will it affect more cocoons hatch. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the weather calms down, it may affect the number of cocoons that hatch. The calming weather could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects: Calm weather may provide a more stable and safer environment for both caterpillars and cocoons, increasing the likelihood of successful hatching. Warmer and stable temperatures may also contribute to the faster development of the pupa inside the cocoon, leading to more cocoons hatching. Indirect effects: Calm weather may also lead to a healthier environment for plants on which caterpillars feed. This could result in better nourishment for the caterpillars, giving them a higher likelihood of reaching the cocoon stage and eventually hatching. The calm weather may also reduce the number of predators or parasites that could harm the caterpillars and cocoons, thereby improving their chances of survival and hatching. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of calmer weather can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of caterpillars becoming butterflies, potentially leading to more cocoons hatching."},{"question":"Paul: Did you water the plants?

Sara and her husband Peter (Martin Donovan), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a âFor Rentâ sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy (Ty Wood) and cousins Wendy (Amanda Crew) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a funeral home; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary. Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu (Elias Koteas), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall. The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt's illness and bizarre behavior. The children find a box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt's visions, at a sÃ©ance, emitting ectoplasm.

Concepts included in the sentence: 1. Astrophysicist: An astrophysicist is a scientist who studies the physics and chemistry of celestial objects such as stars, planets, galaxies, and the cosmic background radiation that permeates the universe. They investigate phenomena ranging from black holes to cosmic rays to uncover the laws governing the universe's structure and evolution. 2. Novel method: This term indicates that the astrophysicist discovered a new, original, or innovative technique or approach to solving a problem, making a measurement, or answering a question. 3. Expanding universe: The expanding universe is the observation that galaxies and other celestial objects are moving away from each other, implying that the universe is constantly growing in size. This concept is a key aspect of modern cosmology and was first theoretically predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. 4. Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR): The cosmic microwave background radiation is the thermal radiation that fills the universe and is a remnant from the hot, dense state of the early universe, which has cooled and expanded over time. Discovered in 1964, its near-uniformity in all directions provides strong evidence for the big bang model of the universe's origins. 5. Advanced algorithms: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a computation. Advanced algorithms, in this case, refers to complex or sophisticated mathematical and computational techniques designed to process and analyze the data collected from the cosmic microwave background radiation. These algorithms often involve statistical methods, machine learning, or numerical simulations. 6. High-performance supercomputer: A high-performance supercomputer is a powerful computing system capable of processing data and performing calculations at extremely high speeds. These machines are often used for complex, data-intensive scientific calculations and simulations, such as those required to analyze the cosmic microwave background radiation data.

Step 1: Determine the best time for the sailing lessons Christopher first needed to find a suitable time for both himself and Eric to begin the sailing lessons. He knew that Eric was quite busy, so he thought it would be best to find a weekend where they both had free time. Step 2: Gather appropriate equipment and resources Before the lessons could begin, Christopher needed to make sure he had the right equipment to begin sailing. He made a list of essential items such as a life jacket, non-slip shoes, gloves, and sunglasses. He also decided to look into renting a beginner-friendly sailboat, as he did not own one himself. Step 3: Learn and understand sailing terminology Christopher thought it would be helpful to familiarize himself with some basic sailing terminology before starting his lessons with Eric. He looked up terms such as \\"port,\\" \\"starboard,\\" \\"bow,\\" and \\"stern\\" so that he would have a foundational understanding of what Eric would be teaching him. Step 4: Schedule and prepare for the first lesson Once Christopher and Eric had found a date that worked for them both, Christopher started preparing for his first sailing lesson. He gathered his equipment, double-checked the weather forecast to ensure conditions were safe for sailing, and made sure to arrive at the marina early. Step 5: Begin sailing lessons with Eric Christopher met Eric at the marina and they boarded the rented sailboat. Eric began teaching Christopher all about boat handling, safety procedures, and essential maneuvers. Christopher paid close attention and diligently practiced each new skill under Eric's guidance.

Although the majority of Americans favor stronger gun control measures, they never seem to happen. This is in large part due to the actions of a single organization, the National Rifle Association. Historically, the NRA supported hunting, marksmanship, safety training – and common sense gun laws. But a faction takeover of its leadership in 1977 brought into power a group with extreme views, which have now become the NRA party line. Many members of the NRA don’t support its more extreme policies. For example, 74% of NRA members support requiring background checks for anyone purchasing a gun, and 71% support prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns – positions that are the opposite of the NRA stance. So why do they remain members? One reason is financial – NRA members receive valuable discounts on things like insurance and hotel stays. The myriad of discounts offered to NRA members by corporations are listed on the membership benefits page on the NRA site. These partners of the NRA include MetLife, LifeLock, eHealth, Norton Security, Allied Movers, NorthAmerican Van Lines, Hertz, Avis, and the First National Bank of Omaha. Indeed, the NRA touts the many special discounts as number two in its list of reasons to join the organization, and stresses the “access to hundreds of dollars in savings.” These corporate partnerships not only help the NRA attract and retain members, but also provide funds for the NRA that help fuel its extremist agenda. It’s time to tell companies that it is no longer acceptable for them to be associated with the NRA. Let’s send a message to the NRA membership benefits partners they must end sever their relationships with the NRA. This petition is aimed at 25 of the companies involved in the NRA membership benefits program. This is because 25 is the limit for a Change.org petition. Let’s start with these 25, and then go after the others later. In addition to signing and sharing this petition, please look at our Google document which lists all of the partner companies and contact information for them, and consider also reaching out to the companies directly to show your displeasure. ||||| In this Feb. 22, 2018, photo, Dana Loesch, spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), at National Harbor, Md.

She is poised, photogenic... (Associated Press) CHICAGO (AP) — Dana Loesch is the new public face of the National Rifle Association, an organization long associated with older white men. At 39, she's poised, photogenic and a skilled public speaker, yet she's not softening the message of the NRA as it becomes an increasingly active voice in the nation's culture wars, with positions on everything from immigration to the media. In the aftermath of the shooting deaths of 17 people, mostly students, at a Florida high school, it's Loesch who has been the NRA's main messenger. The NRA dispatched Loesch last week to a CNN town hall, where she was questioned by students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the Valentine's Day shooting. Often brash and combative, Loesch was measured and even-tempered, though she was booed when she left the stage. Charlie Sykes, a longtime conservative radio host who has been critical of the NRA, said Loesch's skill is communicating with a broad range of Americans while retaining the ultra-conservative base built by Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president and CEO since 1991. \\"Imagine Wayne LaPierre sitting in that seat and you realize the significance of Dana,\\" Sykes said. \\"She can bring the hot sauce without having that persona\\" of an angry white man. Even before taking over as NRA spokeswoman last year, Loesch had a robust conservative following, cultivated on social media — she has more than 46 million Twitter followers — and through years of television and radio appearances, including on her own radio program, \\"The Dana Show.\\" The day after the televised town hall, she was back in her more familiar mode, speaking to a far friendlier audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington. Loesch defiantly defended NRA's 5 million members, who she said \\"will not be gaslighted into thinking that we're responsible for a tragedy that we had nothing to do with.\\" And, her voice dripping with condescension, she addressed journalists from the mainstream media, who she said \\"love mass shootings\\" because \\"crying white mothers are ratings gold.\\" Her criticism of the media recalled an NRA video last summer in which she attacked The New York Times in a way that some on the right and the left feared could incite violence. In the video, Loesch said NRA members have \\"had it\\" with the newspaper's \\"fake news\\" and warned: \\"Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow. ... In short? We're coming for you.\\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said she was not in the least reassured by Loesch's appearance at the town hall, especially after she attacked the media the following day. \\"She's younger. She's a woman and a mom. She's television-ready,\\" Watts said. \\"But her rhetoric is just as radicalized, if not more, than Wayne LaPierre's.\\" Loesch grew up in a blue-collar family in a small Missouri town near St. Louis, reared mainly by her mother after her parents' divorce. She told The Times that she recalls her grandfather hunting deer and raccoon, but also a night her grandfather stood on the porch with a shotgun to protect her aunt from an estranged husband. \\"Looking back, I think I always wanted to know that I was safe,\\" she told the newspaper for an article published last month. Loesch studied journalism at Webster University, but dropped out when she became pregnant with her first son. She soon began writing a blog about motherhood and started her radio program. She later helped found the St. Louis tea party and had stints as a political analyst at Breitbart News Network and The Blaze. Loesch, who has said she keeps a handgun near her bed and has a tattoo on her forearm with a reference to a Bible passage calling for Christians to wear holy armor, has never been afraid of being provocative. During a 2012 radio show, Loesch said she didn't have a problem with Marines who urinated on dead Taliban soldiers, declaring: \\"I'd drop trou and do it too.\\" ___ Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| CLOSE Companies being urged to cut ties with the gun rights group, advocating a NRA boycott.

United is notifying the NRA that we will no longer offer a discounted rate to their annual meeting and we are asking that the NRA remove our information from their website. — United Airlines (@united) February 24, 2018 Delta is reaching out to the NRA to let them know we will be ending their contract for discounted rates through our group travel program. We will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website. — Delta (@Delta) February 24, 2018 Both companies said they had asked the NRA to remove these offers from its website. \\"United is notifying the NRA that we will no longer offer a discounted rate to their annual meeting and we are asking that the NRA remove our information from their website,\\" the airlines said on Twitter. The moves, in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., follow decisions this week by rental car companies Hertz, Enterprise and Avis Budget to end their NRA discounts. The NRA defended itself Saturday in a statement while condemning firms that have decided to cut off their relationship with the organization: \\"The law-abiding members of the NRA had nothing at all to do with the failure of that school's security preparedness, the failure of America's mental health system, the failure of the National Instant Check System or the cruel failures of both federal and local law enforcement.\\" The NRA continued by saying that corporations who \\"decided to punish NRA membership is a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.\\" \\"Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.\\" The pro-gun lobby has come under sharp criticism, particularly from students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, for opposing efforts to curb the sale of semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 used in the shootings. A Change.org petition calling on 25 companies to break ties with the NRA had received almost 7,000 signatures by Saturday morning.

In addition, Amazon, Apple, Google and Roku are under pressure to end streaming of the NRA's NRAtv. Hollywood celebrities including \\"Law & Order: SVU\\" executive producer Warren Leight and actors Misha Collins, Evan Handler, Amy Hargreaves, Alyssa Milano, Tara Strong and Ally Walker on Thursday began pushing Amazon to stop streaming NRAtv, the NRA’s public relations channel, through Amazon Fire. Amazon Fire is one of the most popular devices that allow people to watch Internet-streaming broadcasts through their television sets. Other video streaming products, including Google’s Chromecast, Apple TV, and Roku, were also under pressure to remove NRAtv from their services. NRAtv features 36 channels which covering topics such as politics, hunting and gun collecting. Some of the most popular are talk show-like formats.

The NRA, initially a supporter of hunting, marksmanship, safety training, and common-sense gun laws, transformed its ideologies after a faction takeover in 1977. With many NRA members actually supporting policies contrary to those now promoted by the group, its sustenance relies heavily on corporate discounts and partnership, with companies such as MetLife, LifeLock, and Hertz contributing to funds. In response to recent shootings, calls have emerged for corporations to disassociate themselves from the NRA and for individuals to directly express displeasure to partner companies."},{"question":"Premise: uh seems like it had a radiator leak once but i never had any major anything other than the compressor Hypothesis: The compressor is perfect, I've never had to replace it.

But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. and the situation: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.

How many vegetables did the garden produce? A: 768 Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"Step 1: Determine the number of cucumbers. Since the garden produced 60 fewer cucumbers than potatoes, we subtract 60 from the number of potatoes: 237 potatoes - 60 = 177 cucumbers. Step 2: Determine the number of peppers. The garden produced twice as many peppers as cucumbers, so we multiply the number of cucumbers by 2: 177 cucumbers * 2 = 354 peppers. Step 3: Calculate the total number of vegetables. Now that we know the number of each vegetable, we add these values together to determine the total number of vegetables produced by the garden: 237 potatoes + 177 cucumbers + 354 peppers = 768 vegetables. Thus, the garden produced a total of 768 vegetables."},{"question":"Toinen haaste, johon on vastattava, on maahanmuuttajien kotouttaminen.

The brave men and women, including those from both national and international teams, work collectively to bring comfort and hope to those affected by this natural disaster. This article explores the efforts put forth by these rescue teams, their methods, and the challenges they have faced while conducting their life-saving missions. Turkey's Earthquake: A Snapshot On [insert date], a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 shook western Turkey, particularly the province of Izmir and its surroundings, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The tremor was also felt in neighboring areas, such as Greece and Bulgaria, where casualties have been reported as well. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Aegean Sea, near the island of Samos in Greece, which resulted in a small tsunami affecting the coastal regions of Turkey and Greece. Buildings collapsed, and many people found themselves trapped under the rubble, highlighting the need for immediate rescue and relief efforts. Rescue Efforts In the aftermath of the earthquake, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) mobilized its search and rescue teams which comprise of not only government personnel but also volunteers. Additionally, international assistance was provided by various countries, including search-and-rescue teams from Greece, France, and Germany. These rescue teams, armed with advanced equipment such as life detectors, thermal imaging cameras, and search dogs, have been working non-stop to search for trapped survivors, often facing numerous challenges such as unstable structures, aftershocks, and limited time. While tirelessly digging through the rubble, the teams have managed to save hundreds of lives so far, and they continue to operate around the clock in search of more survivors. Challenges and Limitations The rescue operations are not without difficulties, as crews face numerous challenges along the way. The recovery process has been slow and laborious, as manual lifting of debris is often the only option, given the hazards of heavy machinery usage in densely-populated, urban areas with narrow streets. Additionally, the uncertainty of the number of people still trapped under the rubble complicates the efforts, as some of these individuals had not been accounted for prior to the earthquake, making it difficult to estimate potential rescue successes. Furthermore, with each passing hour, the chances of finding survivors diminish, as individuals caught under the debris face the risk of dehydration, hypothermia, or life-threatening injuries. Rescue crews also face the constant fear of aftershocks, which pose a threat to both the rescuers and those still trapped under the remains of collapsed buildings. Strength Through National and International Cooperation In these trying times, rescue operations not only symbolize a nation's commitment to its people but also showcase the value of international cooperation. With countries offering support and resources, there exists a strong sense of unity in this joint human endeavor to save lives and help people rebuild their lives. Though the earthquake has caused much devastation, it has also revealed the strength of humanity, as rescue crews tirelessly search for every last survivor. Particularly impressive is the fact that long-time political rivals, Turkey and Greece, have set aside their differences to focus on saving lives and providing aid to those in need. Conclusion Rescue efforts in the wake of Turkey's devastating earthquake serve as a powerful reminder of both the fragility and resilience of human life. Courageous rescue crews persevere under extreme conditions to save lives trapped in the rubble, while both local and international communities come together to offer support during these difficult times. Amid the chaos and destruction, hope remains as these dedicated individuals work tirelessly in the search for survivors, highlighting the power of unity and compassion in the face of adversity."},{"question":"Process: - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination.

Answer the above question based on the context below: It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus \\"Surnia\\" of the family Strigidae, the \\"typical\\" owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the \\"Ninox\\" genus are also called \\"hawk owls\\". - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Barn - owls ( family Tytonidae ) are one of the two families of owls , the other being the true owls or typical owls , Strigidae . They are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart - shaped faces . They have long , strong legs with powerful talons . They also differ from Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet . The barn owls comprise two extant sub-families : the Tytoninae or Tyto owls ( including the common barn owl ) and the Phodilinae or bay - owls . The Sibley - Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order ; here , the barn - owls are a subfamily Tytoninae . This is unsupported by more recent research ( see Cypselomorphae ) , but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved . The barn owls are a wide ranging family , although they are absent from northern North America , Saharan Africa and large areas of Asia . They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests , and from temperate latitudes to the tropics . The majority of the 16 living species of barn owls are poorly known . Some , like the red owl , have barely been seen or studied since their discovery , in contrast to the common barn owl , which is one of the best known owl species in the world . However , some sub-species of the common barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species , but are very poorly known . Five species of barn - owl are threatened , and some island species have gone extinct during the Holocene or earlier ( e.g. Tyto pollens , known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas , and possibly the basis for the mythical Chickcharnie ) . The barn - owls are mostly nocturnal , and generally non-migratory , living in pairs or singly . - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. - The genus Tyto includes all barn owls (family Tytonidae) except for the bay owls (subfamily Phodilinae, genus \\"Phodilus\\") that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. \\"Tyto\\" owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. \\"Tyto\\" owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls. The name \\"tyto ()\\" is onomatopeic Greek for owl. - The burrowing owl (\\"Athene cunicularia\\") is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (\\"Cynomys\\" spp.). Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting. - Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family Accipitridae which are widely distributed and varying greatly in size. What is the relationship between 'barn-owl' and 'strigiformes'?

Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, the park includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"Fort Tilden. While Gateway National Recreation Area houses several forts and parks across New York City's boroughs, including Fort Wadsworth and Great Kills Park on Staten Island, Fort Tilden is not among them. Fort Tilden is located in Queens on the western Rockaway Peninsula and is an important part of the recreation area within that borough. Gateway National Recreation Area is a vast and diverse entity managed by the National Park Service, which offers various recreational and educational options for visitors and residents alike. The area includes sites, parks, and resources spread across three New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Within Staten Island, the recreation area encompasses two main locations: 1. Fort Wadsworth: This historic fort played a crucial role in defending New York Harbor from the Revolutionary War to the end of World War II. It features the pre-Civil War era Battery Weed, built between 1845 and 1861, and Fort Tompkins, which served as a coastal gun battery. Fort Wadsworth also offers breath-taking views of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn. 2. Great Kills Park: Featuring beaches, nature trails, a public marina, and numerous sport facilities, Great Kills Park is an excellent destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The park's name \\"Great Kills\\" derives from the Dutch term for \\"many creeks,\\" and it reflects the park's location at the mouth of several tidal wetlands. Fort Tilden, on the other hand, is situated in the borough of Queens and offers different opportunities for visitors to explore its historical significance. The fort served as a strategic coastal defense site from the First World War until the early Cold War period. Today, it provides visitors with access to a stretch of beautiful beach, the historic battery installations, walking and biking trails, and a nature preserve. In conclusion, Fort Tilden is the fort you will not find on Staten Island as it is located in Queens. Gateway National Recreation Area encompasses a variety of parks and sites across New York City, offering visitors the chance to explore the region's rich history and natural beauty. While Staten Island's contributions to the recreation area include Fort Wadsworth and Great Kills Park, Fort Tilden stands as an important and distinct feature of the recreational space in Queens."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question In addition to the sports he played at Yale, Kerry is described by Sports Illustrated, among others, as an \\"avid cyclist\\", primarily riding on a road bike.

The gold is formed when a tremor splits open a fluid-filled cavity in the Earth's crust, causing a sudden drop in pressure, according to a team of Australian researchers. This, in turn, causes the fluid to expand rapidly and evaporate, and any gold particles that had been dissolved in it to \\"precipitate almost immediately\\", said a Nature press release. \\"Repeated earthquakes could therefore lead to the build up of economic-grade gold deposits.\\" The researchers said much of the world's known gold was derived from quarts veins that were formed during geological periods of mountain building as long as three billion years ago. The veins formed during earthquakes, but the magnitude of pressure fluctuations or how they drove gold mineralisation were not known. For this study, researchers used a numerical model to simulate the drop in pressure experienced in a fluid-filled fault cavity during an earthquake. In so doing, they answered a long-standing question about the world's gold resources -- how the metal becomes so concentrated from a highly dissolved state to a solid, mineable one. The study said single tremors would not generate economically viable gold deposits, which were built up one thin coating at a time. To form a 100 tonne gold vein deposit would take less than 100,000 years, the team wrote. Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved. More » ||||| The tyrannosaur of the minerals, this gold nugget in quartz weighs more than 70 ounces (2 kilograms). Earthquakes have the Midas touch, a new study claims. Water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake, depositing gold, according to a model published in the March 17 issue of the journal Nature Geoscience. The model provides a quantitative mechanism for the link between gold and quartz seen in many of the world's gold deposits, said Dion Weatherley, a geophysicist at the University of Queensland in Australia and lead author of the study. When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a rupture in the ground — a fracture called a fault. Big faults can have many small fractures along their length, connected by jogs that appear as rectangular voids. Water often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs. About 6 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface, under incredible temperatures and pressures, the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide, silica and economically attractive elements like gold. Shake, rattle and gold During an earthquake, the fault jog suddenly opens wider. It's like pulling the lid off a pressure cooker: The water inside the void instantly vaporizes, flashing to steam and forcing silica, which forms the mineral quartz, and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces, suggest Weatherley and co-author Richard Henley, of the Australian National University in Canberra. While scientists have long suspected that sudden pressure drops could account for the link between giant gold deposits and ancient faults, the study takes this idea to the extreme, said Jamie Wilkinson, a geochemist at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the study. \\"To me, it seems pretty plausible. It's something that people would probably want to model either experimentally or numerically in a bit more detail to see if it would actually work,\\" Wilkinson told OurAmazingPlanet. Previously, scientists suspected fluids would effervesce, bubbling like an opened soda bottle, during earthquakes or other pressure changes. This would line underground pockets with gold. Others suggested minerals would simply accumulate slowly over time. Weatherley said the amount of gold left behind after an earthquake is tiny, because underground fluids carry at most only one part per million of the precious element. But an earthquake zone like New Zealand's Alpine Fault, one of the world's fastest, could build a mineable deposit in 100,000 years, he said. Surprisingly, the quartz doesn't even have time to crystallize, the study indicates. Instead, the mineral comes out of the fluid in the form of nanoparticles, perhaps even making a gel-like substance on the fracture walls. The quartz nanoparticles then crystallize over time. [Gold Quiz: From Nuggets to Flecks] Even earthquakes smaller than magnitude 4.0, which may rattle nerves but rarely cause damage, can trigger flash vaporization, the study finds. \\"Given that small-magnitude earthquakes are exceptionally frequent in fault systems, this process may be the primary driver for the formation of economic gold deposits,\\" Weatherley told OurAmazingPlanet. The hills have gold Quartz-linked gold has sourced some famous deposits, such as the placer gold that sparked the 19th-century California and Klondike gold rushes. Both deposits had eroded from quartz veins upstream. Placer gold consists of particles, flakes and nuggets mixed in with sand and gravel in stream and river beds. Prospectors traced the gravels back to their sources, where hard-rock mining continues today. But earthquakes aren't the only cataclysmic source of gold. Volcanoes and their underground plumbing are just as prolific, if not more so, at producing the precious metal. While Weatherley and Henley suggest that a similar process could take place under volcanoes, Wilkinson, who studies volcano-linked gold, said that's not the case. \\"Beneath volcanoes, most of the gold is not precipitated in faults that are active during earthquakes,\\" Wilkinson said. \\"It's a very different mechanism.\\" Understanding how gold forms helps companies prospect for new mines. \\"This new knowledge on gold-deposit formation mechanisms may assist future gold exploration efforts,\\" Weatherley said. In their quest for gold, humans have pulled more than 188,000 tons (171,000 metric tons) of the metal from the ground, exhausting easily accessed sources, according to the World Gold Council, an industry group.

When the series was collected into a single volume later that year, the story title for the first issue was applied to the entire series. The Dark Knight Returns tells an alternative story of Bruce Wayne, who at 55 years old returns from retirement to fight crime and faces opposition from the Gotham City police force and the United States government. Context: Despite the cost of the single-issue packaging, The Dark Knight Returns sold well. Priced at 2.95 an issue, DC Comics promoted The Dark Knight Returns as a \\"thought-provoking action story\\". Time said the series' depiction of a \\"semi-retired Batman [who] is unsure about his crime-fighting abilities\\" was an example of trying to appeal to \\"today's skeptical readers\\". IGN Comics ranked The Dark Knight Returns first on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels and called The Dark Knight Returns \\"a true masterpiece of storytelling\\" with \\"[s]cene after unforgettable scene.\\" In 2005, Time chose the collected edition as one of the 10 best English language graphic novels ever written. Forbidden Planet placed the collected issue at number one on its \\"50 Best of the Best Graphic Novels\\" list. Writer Matthew K. Manning in the \\"1980s\\" chapter of DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle (2010) called the series \\"arguably the best Batman story of all time.\\" It was placed second in a poll among comic book academics conducted by the Sequart Organization. The series also garnered some negative reviews. In April 2010, Nicolas Slayton from Comics Bulletin ranked The Dark Knight Returns second in his Tuesday Top Ten feature's Top 10 Overrated Comic Books behind Watchmen. Slayton wrote, \\"[t]here is no central plot to the comic, leaving only a forced fight scene between Superman and Batman as an out of place climax to the story.\\" \\"Gone are the traits that define Batman,\\" also citing \\"misuse of the central character.\\" The New York Times gave the 1987 collected release of the series a negative review. Mordecai Richler felt that The Dark Knight Returns was not as imaginative as the work of Batman creator Bob Kane. Richler commented, \\"The stories are convoluted, difficult to follow and crammed with far too much text. The drawings offer a grotesquely muscle-bound Batman and Superman, not the lovable champions of old.\\" He concluded, \\"If this book is meant for kids, I doubt that they will be pleased. If it is aimed at adults, they are not the sort I want to drink with.\\" Question: What did people think of the novels?. Whats the answer?","response":"People had varied opinions on The Dark Knight Returns. Many praised the series and considered it a masterpiece of storytelling, with some ranking it as one of the greatest Batman graphic novels and among the best English language graphic novels ever written. However, there were also negative reviews, with some critics feeling that the plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, and that the character portrayals deviated from the originals.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job.

I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding.

Available options: *You can properly care for hemorrhoids using helpful medical techniques that help relieve the pressure. Look for enlarged veins or bleeding vessels.; *Hemorrhoids develop because of a lack of blood flow to the veins.

Originally believing they had settled in Utah, the Mormon pioneers were attracted to the large salt deposits in the surrounding area. Most of the Mormons abandoned the town after they discovered they were actually in Nevada and owed three years of state taxes. A new wave of settlers brought in farmers, and St. Thomas’s population peaked at roughly 500. That all changed in 1936 with the completion of the Hoover Dam. The dam caused water levels of the Colorado River to rise, creating Lake Mead, one of the world’s largest reservoirs, in its wake. St. Thomas had to be abandoned and its townspeople relocated. Over the past decade, however, widespread drought, and growing regional water usage has caused water levels of Lake Mead to drop, and with it, the formerly submerged town has resurfaced.

Perhaps her mind had wandered back to her tumultuous childhood, where strong emotions of both love and loss were intertwined with the formation of her identity. Or maybe it was the painful memory of a romantic relationship gone awry, leaving her heartbroken and scarred, yet infinitely wiser for the experience. Mary's distant gaze could have also been a reflection of her current state of affairs -- grappling with the pressures of a successful career while attempting to maintain a balanced lifestyle, while also shouldering the responsibilities of various personal commitments. Could it be that her seemingly perfect life was beginning to unravel at the seams, only to be kept in place by the sheer mental fortitude and stoicism she exhibited? Or, perhaps just as likely, Mary was lost in contemplation of the future. Carrie was aware that Mary had long dreamed of embarking on a life-changing journey, possibly traveling to distant lands to immerse herself in their cultures and traditions. Could it be that in these precious moments of disconnect from reality, Mary was mentally preparing herself for such an adventure, wondering what obstacles, triumphs, and invaluable lessons awaited her on the horizon? As Carrie's own thoughts churned and raced to decipher Mary's enigma, she found herself becoming gradually more attuned to the beauty in the unspoken connection that moments like these could foster. For even as they stood physically apart, locked in their respective introspections, their silent camaraderie allowed both women to embark on their own emotional voyages, firmly anchored by the knowledge that the other's unwavering support and understanding awaited them upon their return. Eventually, Mary's blank stare dissolved and her eyes softened as they refocused on the world around her. The fleeting moment of disconnection had given way to a renewed clarity, as her unwavering gaze met Carrie's once more. An unspoken understanding passed between them, encased within a simple, warm smile that said more than words ever could."},{"question":"Give a stream of consciousness and then the final answer.

Ruth Styles. PUBLISHED:. 04:08 EST, 12 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:28 EST, 12 November 2013. Meeting someone new isn't always the easiest of tasks, so spare a thought for China's young women who face intense parental pressure to find the right man. As a result, women terrified of returning home without a handsome other half resort to hiring 'boyfriends' for the duration of their visit. Now a shopping website, Taobao, has launched a new rent-a-boyfriend service which allows would-be fake other halves to advertise their services - complete with price lists. False romance: Women under pressure are resorting to fake boyfriends in a bid to impress their families. According to Chinese newspaper, the People's Daily, rent-a-boyfriends must be hired for a minimum of three days and offer a range of services including dinner (50 yuan, approximately £5) and shopping trips (30 yuan, approximately £3), on top of their 30 yuan hourly fee. Other services include seeing a film, although you will have to pay double if the movie is a thriller, and a 50 yuan peck on the lips, although hand-holding and a goodbye kiss on the cheek or forehead are free. 'I wanted to earn some pocket money when I had just graduated from university and started to work,' explains one advertiser, 27-year-old Matthew Fang from Chongqing. 'This rental business isn’t bad, especially during the Chinese Lunar New Year when there are family reunions.' End game: The women are searching for someone to marry but make do with a stand in while the hunt goes on. And business is booming for a reason. Chinese women in particular still face enormous parental pressure to meet a suitable man and rather than face a barrage of questions from nosy relatives, hire their men instead. According to Fang, the recruitment process begins with a preliminary meeting to discuss the client's requirements and to get their back story straight. Typically, the pair will exchange photos and will have a rehearsal before going ahead with the rental. Despite the detailed list of services and attempts - on both sides - to keep relations professional, some of the rent-a-boyfriends admit that it can, at times, be difficult. 'It all depends on how you look at it,' says another fake boyfriend, 26-year-old Xu Li from Yancheng City. 'If you look at it as a business, then it’s much easier.' The New York Observer has pinpointed a new phenomenon which sees wealthy Americans reject real friends in favour of a paid entourage. A fashion designer, who was anonymously quoted in The Observer’s piece much like rest of the article’s sources, told the paper: ‘There is a market, a currency for paid friends in New York. Some people need the money, and some people need the friends.’ But while being a paid friend might sound like an easy way to make a living, it's not always champagne bars and lavish dinners. ‘You’re always on someone else’s schedule — sort of like being a pet monkey,’ said one paid friend who lives between New York and LA. 'Being a paid friend is complicated,' he continued. 'When you’re in the presidential suite, it’s amazing, sometimes it can be emasculating, but I put my ego away a long time ago.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"1. Chinese women under intense parental pressure to find a suitable partner are resorting to hiring fake boyfriends through a rent-a-boyfriend service provided by shopping website Taobao. 2. Boyfriends for hire offer various services, such as dinners and shopping trips, and must be hired for a minimum of three days. 3. The rental business thrives during family gatherings like the Chinese Lunar New Year. 4. The client and the fake boyfriend discuss requirements and rehearse their backstory before the rental period. 5.

The school board attributed this problem to a lack of modern facilities, outdated curriculum, and insufficient teacher training. They believe that transforming the educational system will boost student achievement and keep the school district viable. After several discussions, they decided to implement a blended learning approach, which integrates online resources and face-to-face instruction to create a more personalized learning environment. Hypothesis: By implementing a blended learning approach in the local school district, student enrollment and academic performance will significantly improve due to the combination of online resources and traditional face-to-face instruction, catering to a more diverse range of learning styles and providing a more engaging and supportive atmosphere for students."},{"question":"Premise: The woman's ring slipped off in the shower. What is the effect? 1). The woman polished the ring.. 2). The ring went down the drain..","response":"Based on the given premise, we can infer various potential effects or consequences. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let us discuss each potential effect separately, as mentioned: 1) The woman polished the ring: One potential effect of the woman's ring slipping off in the shower is that it may have caused her to clean or polish the ring. This could be due to several reasons: a) Realization of the ring's condition: When the ring slipped off her finger, she might have noticed that the ring had collected dirt, grime, soap scum, or other build-ups over time. This realization would prompt her to polish the ring to restore its shine and beauty effectively. b) Protection from further incidents: After the incident where her ring slipped off, the woman might have wanted to prevent such incidents in the future. Polishing the ring could be her way to remove any slippery residues that might have caused the ring to become loose, thus ensuring it fits better on her finger. c) Emotional attachment: If the ring holds sentimental value for the woman, the incident may have triggered her emotional attachment to it, and thus, take better care of the ring. Polishing the ring is an act of cherishing her memories and attachment to it. 2) The ring went down the drain: Another potential effect of the woman's ring slipping off in the shower is that it might have gone down the drain. In this case, various scenarios can be explored: a) Panic and immediate action: Losing the ring down the drain could lead to a sense of panic and urgency to retrieve it. The woman would be stressed about the loss and may attempt to retrieve it by taking apart the drain, using a drain snake, or improvising with other tools. The retrieval process might be time-consuming, and if unsuccessful, cause even greater distress. b) Calling a plumber: If the woman is unable to retrieve the ring herself, she could call a plumber for professional assistance. Consequently, there could be financial implications since hiring a plumber might be costly. Additionally, the plumber would need to access her home, which may cause a level of inconvenience and disruption to her daily routines. c) Emotional distress: Losing the ring down the drain could lead to emotional distress for the woman if the ring had sentimental value or memories attached to it. She might feel guilty for being careless, grief for the loss, and anxiety about the uncertainty of recovering the ring. d) Complications in relationships: If the ring was a symbol of her relationship with a significant other, the loss could cause complications in the relationship. The significance of the lost ring might lead to miscommunication or feelings of disappointment, especially if the ring was a gift or an engagement/wedding ring. e) Replacement: In the unfortunate event that the ring cannot be recovered, the woman might consider replacing it. Depending on the ring's value, seeking a replacement could be costly, time-consuming, and potentially emotionally unfulfilling due to the sentimental value attached to the original ring. Hence, the effect of the woman's ring slipping off in the shower can lead to various potential consequences depending on whether she decided to clean or polish the ring or lost the ring down the drain. Both situations come with their own set of implications on the woman's emotional state, actions taken, and possible changes in her relationships."},{"question":"Answer the question about text: Let 's throw down some history shall we ? I have been choreographing dance pieces for only a year , and before I was doing that I had wanted to ( two years ago to now ) choreograph a dance to the first section of my piece Starch Rebellion . While it sounds much longer to say it than what is the reality , I have been wanting - in one way or another - to choreograph this dance for my whole career as a choreographer . For this very reason - and because of pressures to continue to choreograph pieces that are worthy of praise , along with the fact that this is most \\" prestigious \\" event I have ever choreographed for - I have been super nervous about this freakin ' dance . What may be the plausible reason that I feel nervous ?","response":"The plausible reasons for feeling nervous can be attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, the individual's relatively short experience in choreographing dance pieces, having only done it for a year, can create a sense of insecurity and amplify anxiety. Given the individual's desire to choreograph a dance to the first section of their piece \\"Starch Rebellion\\" since the beginning of their career as a choreographer, there is undoubtedly a strong emotional attachment and self-imposed expectations for the outcome. This attachment further adds to the nervousness. Secondly, there is pressure to maintain the standard and quality of previously choreographed pieces, which have been deemed worthy of praise. The individual may be worried that their new choreography for \\"Starch Rebellion\\" may not live up to the high expectations set by their past work, thereby affecting their professional reputation. Moreover, given that the event for which they are choreographing is the most prestigious one they have ever participated in, the stakes are higher than before. This can lead to a fear of failure or underperformance, which can be nerve-wracking. Therefore, the plausible reasons for feeling nervous include the relatively short choreography experience, the long-standing desire and attachment to choreograph \\"Starch Rebellion,\\" the pressure to uphold the quality of prior work, and the weight of performing at a highly esteemed event. Combined, these factors contribute to feelings of nervousness and anxiety ahead of the much-anticipated dance choreography."},{"question":"Student: Premise: \\"A crates of fish in the middle of a group of people.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A crate of sardines is surrounded by a group of bystanders.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

In this statement, we know that it specifically mentions sardines, which is a type of fish, and it is surrounded by bystanders, similar to the people in the premise. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis The main difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the specific type of fish.

Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise Based on our analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as there is not enough information in the premise to conclude that the crate contains sardines specifically.

Can we infer the following? Education is the topics of discussion","response":"Yes, from the information provided, we can infer that education is the topic of discussion in this particular situation involving the Prime Minister and Mr. Landry. The context implies that the federal government is intervening in matters related to education in Quebec, which is seen as an area of provincial jurisdiction. This intervention has generated strong opposition from various stakeholders such as students, the academic community, and individuals from different political affiliations. In Canada, education is primarily a provincial responsibility, with each province having its education system, regulations, and policies. The federal government does have a role in education, particularly in regards to funding post-secondary institutions, research, and providing educational support to Indigenous communities. However, it is important to maintain a clear separation of responsibilities, as education is constitutionally assigned to the provinces. In this context, the Prime Minister's conversation with Mr. Landry appears to center around the controversy arising from the federal government's intervention in Quebec's education matters. The opposition to this intervention indicates a perceived overreach by the federal government into provincial jurisdiction, causing concerns among various groups. Students, the academic community, and federalists and sovereignists alike are all mentioned as stakeholders voicing their opposition to the federal government's involvement. This demonstrates that the issue transcends political lines and carries significant weight as a matter of concern for the broader Quebec society. In summary, the discussion between the Prime Minister and Mr. Landry revolves around the federal government's actions in the field of education in Quebec, specifically concerning the controversial intrusion into provincial jurisdiction. The strong opposition from various stakeholders indicates that this issue is of significant importance in Quebec and may have broader implications for debates over the balance of power between federal and provincial governments in Canada."},{"question":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","response":"Certainly! Here's a question with a factual answer: Question: What is the function of the mitochondria in a eukaryotic cell? Answer: The mitochondria, often referred to as the \\"powerhouse of the cell,\\" is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. It serves as the site for cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidizing nutrients, primarily glucose, and converting their stored energy into usable chemical energy for the cell. In addition to generating ATP, the mitochondria also play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (programmed cell death), maintaining calcium homeostasis, and producing heat in thermogenic tissues. Mitochondria contain their own small circular DNA, separate from the cell's nuclear DNA, and have the machinery to replicate and express their own genetic information, which is a unique feature among organelles within eukaryotic cells. This has led scientists to theorize that mitochondria originated from a symbiotic relationship between ancient prokaryotic cells, specifically alpha-proteobacteria, and the ancestors of eukaryotic cells through a process called endosymbiosis. Owing to this symbiotic relationship and their critical role in cellular energetics, mitochondria are essential for the proper functioning, growth, and survival of eukaryotic cells."},{"question":"Question: bailey was not a winner but she also got a trophy.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Where does Thomas wait for death? Title: Queen of the Vampires Movie plot: The Rape of the Vampire[edit] Four sisters living in an old chÃ¢teau are convinced that they are vampires. One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind. Another is afraid of sunlight. They all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure, and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc, who is distraught by Brigitte's death at the hands of the peasants. Queen of the Vampires/The Vampire Woman[edit] The vampire queen (Jacqueline Sieger) is introduced. She briefly arrives by boat to the beach where the dead couple lies. She commands her hooded cohort to grab the old man and pin him down to the slab of rock, then proceeds to sacrifice him, and licks the knife...

Options: - bottom floor - shop - kitchen - shelf - refrigerators The answer is:","response":"The most suitable answer to the question \\"Food is usually stored on what in your pantry?\\" is the option shelf. A pantry is an area or room where food, beverages, ingredients, and sometimes dishes, household cleaning chemicals, linens, or provisions are stored. In well-organized pantries, shelves play a significant role in keeping the items organized and accessible. The use of shelves maximizes the available storage space, as they allow you to store items vertically, making it easier to find and use the stored items. Shelves in a pantry are often adjustable, which enables the pantry to accommodate various types and sizes of food items. They can also be made from different materials, such as wood, metal, or plastic, depending on the user's preference and kitchen decor. They can be free-standing, wall-mounted, or built into closets or cabinets. The other options provided are not as relevant to the question for the following reasons: - Bottom floor: Food is typically not stored directly on the floor of a pantry, as this can lead to contamination and difficulty in accessing items. - Shop: A shop, while obviously connected to purchasing food items, is not a direct answer to the question about storing food in a pantry. - Kitchen: While the kitchen may contain the pantry, it is not the specific location where food is stored within the pantry structure. - Refrigerators: Refrigerators are generally not located within a pantry and are used to store perishable items that require a controlled cold temperature, rather than general pantry items. In conclusion, for the question about where food is usually stored in a pantry, the most suitable and accurate answer is \\"shelf.\\""},{"question":"Q: Q: Nonvascular plants lack vascular tissue and what?

Born in the Boloso Sore District of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn overcame many challenges to rise to the highest political offices in his country. He held various ministerial positions before becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs under the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in 2010. Following Zenawi's death in 2012, Desalegn assumed the mantle of Prime Minister, becoming the first person from a minority ethnic group — the Wolayta — to hold the nation's top office. While Desalegn's tenure as Prime Minister saw numerous difficulties, including territorial disputes with Eritrea and internal social and political unrest, he is also credited with maintaining Ethiopia's stability and directing the country along its modernization path. Essential infrastructure projects were launched during his reign, contributing significantly to shaping up the nation’s socio-economic outlook. The development of Addis Ababa is a crucial part of Desalegn's legacy. The city, often referred to as the \\"political capital of Africa\\" due to its historical, diplomatic, and political significance for the continent, has only grown in importance under Desalegn's leadership. The completion of the Addis Ababa City Hall, an iconic venue for public and national events and a symbolic representation of modern Addis Ababa, is a testament to the transformative agenda of his administration. Addis Ababa City Hall, situated in the heart of the city, represents the aspirations of Ethiopia as a nation striving forward. When the hall was completed, it not only provided a new administrative center for the city's government but also became a symbol of national pride. The building, encompassing traditional Ethiopian architectural elements and modern building technology, reflects the country's progress under Desalegn's administration. The building also hosts a range of government departments, fostering efficiency in civic administration and public service delivery. In conclusion, the tenure of Hailemariam Desalegn as the Prime Minister of Ethiopia left an indelible mark on the country's history, particularly in the concrete development visible in the capital city. The Addis Ababa City Hall, standing tall in the city's landscape, is one such testament to this transformative era — a symbol of Ethiopian resilience, progression, and aspiration for a better future."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and fiber.

I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"First, let's calculate the total cost of maths, science, and art books: 1. For maths books: 4 books * 20 each = 80 2. For science books: Since she bought 6 more science books than maths books, she bought 4 + 6 = 10 science books. So the cost of science books is 10 books * 10 each = 100 3. For art books: Since she bought twice as many art books as maths books, she bought 4 * 2 = 8 art books. So the cost of art books is 8 books * 20 each = 160 Now, let's add these costs together: 80 (maths books) + 100 (science books) + 160 (art books) = 340 (total spent on maths, science, and art books) We know that June started with 500, so let's subtract the total cost for maths, science, and art books from her initial budget: 500 - 340 = 160 So, June spent 160 on music books."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given two statements.

Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle Blankes (Brant van Hoffman) (from the first Police Academy movie). It seems one of the two Police Academy schools is getting the axe, and Mauser wants Copeland and Blankes to make sure that Lassard's one screws up.The next day, after the governor's speech in which he will appoint a committee to evaluate which of the two schools should remain open, Mauser starts getting an edge by kissing up to the governor (offering the committee an escort, showing governor pages of useful tactics, etc.). Nearby, the elderly and slow-witted Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) gets an idea on how to win: along with now Sgt. Jones (Michael Winslow) and Lt. Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), he calls back his former class of '84 alumni misfits; Sgt. Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Sgt. Hightower (Bubba Smith), and Sgt.

Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 until December 13 after unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy. But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs - which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain - found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering of snow where inches of snowfall would usually have fallen by now. Scroll down for video. Heading for the mountains: Skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs (pictured here in the summer) - which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain - found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering of snow. At Les Arcs, which is made up of four resort villages, only one lift was in operation. Skiers were being bussed in from the resorts of Arc 1600, Arc 1800 and Arc 1950 to Arc 2000, where a single 0.6-mile (1km) piste was in operation. The resort’s daily ski report yesterday said the nearest fresh snow had fallen 77 miles (124km) away. One Briton, who owns a ski chalet in Arc 2000, said: ‘There is green and brown land visible all the way up the mountain which would normally be covered in snow. ‘Even Mont Blanc doesn’t look itself. There’s snow on the peak but it doesn’t look anywhere near as plentiful as usual.’ The skier, who did not want to be identified, added: ‘Some of the runs here are grey, with just a dusting of powder, rather than the glistening white scene which is normal at this time of the year.’ Locals blamed a freakishly warm November which melted an early winter snow dump at the lower resorts, and a shortage of atmospheric weather depressions which had brought few new snowfalls - even after the weather in the higher resorts dropped to the sub-zero temperatures which are normal for this time of year. In Arc 2000 - the four resorts are loosely named after the approximate altitude of each village - it is said by locals to be the worst conditions at the start of a ski season in 40 years. Put back: Earlier this month, travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as Courchevel (left) and Meribel (right, file pictures) Ski instructor Philippe Arnauld said: ‘At the moment it is just about okay because the start of the season is never that busy, but from next weekend the resorts will be full for Christmas and New Year. ‘If all the ski schools and the holiday making families have only two lifts between them it is going to be chaos and a catastrophe - and no significant snowfall, perhaps only a few snowflakes, is predicted between now and Christmas. I have no idea what will happen and how we will manage.’ Last Thursday, Chris Fawkes, a BBC weather forecaster, tweeted that an ‘unlucky jet stream pattern this weekend’ was preventing the Alps from ‘getting significant snow’. The Paradiski is the second largest linked skiable domain in the world, with 264 miles of pistes over 14,390 hectares. As well as Les Arcs, it includes the resorts of Peisey-Vallandry and la Plagne. Earlier this month, travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as Courchevel and Meribel. They said the delays would not affect British holidaymakers as the ski seasons for the majority of UK tour operators don’t start until late December. Until 25 years ago and the advent of efficient snow-making machines, most Alpine resorts did not open before mid-December, although the machines need the thermometer to fall to -4C to operate successfully. Val d’Isère, normally one of the most reliable resorts in Europe for snow cover, cancelled the men’s World Cup giant slalom and slalom races scheduled for this past weekend, despite investing in the largest snow-making machine in Europe. Temperatures in the resort on the first weekend of December had reached 5C. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"1. Many British families planning to go on Alpine skiing breaks next weekend are facing the possibility of a green Christmas due to unusually warm temperatures. 2.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario, where the soil becomes unsuitable for mushrooms and there are fewer mature mushrooms, is directly impacting a step of the process. The life cycle of a mushroom starts with the dispersion of spores into the air, and these spores rely heavily on the quality of the soil once they land on the ground. The proper germination and mycelium growth are essential steps in the development of a new mushroom, and both of these steps are highly dependent on the suitability of the soil in which they take place. Good soil provides necessary nutrients, water, and other environmental factors needed for the successful growth of mushrooms. When the soil becomes unsuitable for the mushrooms, it directly impacts the germination of the spores and the subsequent growth of the mycelium. Unsuitable soil may lack the required nutrients, have improper pH levels, or contain harmful substances that inhibit mushroom growth. As a result, the process of germination may be hindered or even completely halted, and the growth of the mycelium may be stunted or abnormal, leading to fewer buds sprouting and, ultimately, fewer mature mushrooms. This perturbation directly affects one or more steps of the process because it targets the very basis of mushroom growth - the soil in which the spores are meant to germinate and the mycelium is meant to develop. Without suitable conditions for these key steps in the life cycle, the process cannot move forward as it should, rendering this perturbation as directly impacting the process. In summary, the supposed perturbation of the soil becoming unsuitable for mushrooms mainly directly impacts the germination and mycelium growth steps of the process. This leads to fewer mature mushrooms, as the necessary conditions for successful development are no longer met."},{"question":"- The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes What might be the last step of the process?","response":"The last step in the process is when the snowflakes fall to the ground, creating a layer of snow. As the ice crystals, now snowflakes, have become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, they are subject to the force of gravity, which pulls them downward. As they descend, snowflakes may continue to accumulate more ice crystals, increasing in size and complexity in their beautiful, unique patterns. Once the snowflakes reach the ground, they begin to form a layer of snow, which can range from a light dusting to thick blankets of several feet, depending on the amount of time the snowfall continues and various atmospheric conditions. This accumulated snow can have a significant impact on the environment, as well as human activities such as transportation and agriculture. In some instances, the snow may melt upon contact with the ground, depending on the surface temperature, which can result in a slushy mixture or pooled water. Alternatively, if the ground and air temperatures remain below freezing, the snow can accumulate quickly, potentially leading to various winter phenomena such as snowdrifts, ice formation, and avalanche-prone conditions in mountainous regions. In certain areas, the continuous accumulation of snow can even lead to the formation of glaciers over an extended period. In summary, the last step in the process of snow formation is the falling of snowflakes to the ground, where they contribute to the creation of a snow layer that can have varying effects on both the natural and human-made environments."},{"question":"Facts: - instrument: guitar - death place: canton , wales - years active: 1966 -- 2005 - caption: tich gwilym performing in 1985 - birth name: robert gwilliam - death date: 19 june 2005 - genre: hard rock , blues-rock , progressive rock , reggae - birth date: 10 september 1950 - name: tich gwilym - image size: 300px - background: non_vocal_instrumentalist - image: tich . jpg gwilym -lrb- aberystwyth , november 1985 -rrb- -1 - birth place: llwynypia , wales - associated acts: kimla taz , superclarkes , mrs hugget , budgie - occupation: musician Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of tich gwilym .","response":"Tich Gwilym, born Robert Gwilliam on September 10, 1950, in Llwynypia, Wales, was a renowned Welsh musician known for his skills as a guitarist.

Factors such as whether it focuses on print, online, broadcasting, and the size of the target audience will impact the required start-up capital. Step 2: Research costs for equipment and infrastructure After defining the scope and scale of the media company, research costs for essential equipment and infrastructure. This may include purchasing or leasing office space, studio equipment, production facilities, and technology. Step 3: Estimate initial staffing levels and salaries Based on the company's size and needs, estimate the number of employees required and their respective salaries. Additional costs such as employee benefits, taxes, and onboarding costs should also be factored in. Step 4: Allocate funds for marketing To ensure a successful media company launch, allocating funds for marketing is crucial. Determine the budget for advertising, public relations, and promotional efforts to ensure your content reaches its target audience. Step 5: Determine initial operating costs Estimate the initial operating costs of the company, including utilities, transportation, and any ongoing expenses related to running the business. Step 6: Plan for unexpected expenses Account for unexpected expenses by setting aside a contingency fund, which can be useful in the event of unforeseen costs. Step 7: Add up all costs to determine the required start-up capital Add up the costs gathered in the previous steps to estimate the total start-up capital needed to launch and operate the media company. Now, let's answer the question: \\"Do those questions have the same meaning?\\" While both questions are asking for the amount of capital needed to start a media company, their wording is slightly different. The first question asks for the amount of \\"start-up money\\" needed to start a \\"mass media company,\\" while the second question asks for the \\"capital\\" (an alternative term for start-up money) required to start a \\"media company.\\" In essence, the meaning of both questions is indeed very similar, since they ultimately ask how much money is needed to start a media company. However, the first question specifies \\"mass media,\\" which may imply a larger scale operation."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Officers PK Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Chris Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the most bad ass cops that New York City has ever seen. The movie opens with them engaged in a high speed chase creating a wanton destruction path of every block that they cross. They do manage to capture the criminals at high speeds. However the infraction they picked them up for was very minor and they manage to do a lot of damage. They are also hailed as heroes and are given the key to the city by the mayor.Back at the station they're also greeted as heroes and treated like celebrities. There's several pairs of officers including Martin and Fosse, officer Bob (who makes announcements about banal activities at inappropriate times) and the other guys - Alan Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), They're admired by Allen Gamble, a by the numbers forensic accountant who is very straight laced and doesn't take any risks. Gamble's partner Terry Hoitz disagrees and he's grown tired of his desk job and wants to see some real hard core action. To make matters worse, Gamble is duped into a prank by fellow officers Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) by firing his gun randomly in the air and he has it taken away. Hoitz also had his gun taken away thanks to a past incident involving working security at game 7 of the World Series and shooting Derek Jeter (Derek Jeter)in the process. Thanks to that incident, he has unwittingly earned the nickname \\"The Yankee Clipper\\". Gamble also has earned an unflattering nickname around the office: \\"Paper Bitch\\".

A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Pneumothorax was not a new technique by any means. In 1696, Giorgio Baglivi reported a general improvement in tuberculosis sufferers after they received sword wounds to the chest. F.H. Ramadge induced the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834, and reported subsequently the patient was cured. It was in the 20th century, however, that scientists sought to rigorously investigate the effectiveness of such procedures. In 1939, the British Journal of Tuberculosis published a study by Oli Hjaltested and Kjeld Törning on 191 patients undergoing the procedure between 1925 and 1931; in 1951, Roger Mitchell published several articles on the therapeutic outcomes of 557 patients treated between 1930 and 1939 at Trudeau Sanatorium in Saranac Lake. The search for a medicinal cure, however, continued in earnest. Question: was there a cure for tuberculosis in the 1800s? Available choices: 1. no 2. yes","response":"To answer the question, let's go through the text step-by-step to identify relevant information. Step 1: Identify if there's any mention of a cure for tuberculosis in the 1800s. The text mentions F.H. Ramadge inducing the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834 and subsequently reporting that the patient was cured. Step 2: Consider if this reported cure would be sufficient evidence to support the existence of a cure for tuberculosis in the 1800s. Though the text states that a patient was reported as cured after receiving a therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834, it is not indicative of a widely accepted and consistent cure for tuberculosis during that time. The fact that the search for a medicinal cure continued in earnest further supports that there wasn't a recognized cure. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, I would choose option 1. no, as there wasn't a consistent and widely accepted cure for tuberculosis in the 1800s."},{"question":"Lizzy: Pauline will make tacos for dinner.

Taco shells cost: 5 2. Bell peppers cost: There are 4 bell peppers and each costs 1.5. So, the total cost for bell peppers would be 4 * 1.5 = 6 3. Meat cost: She bought 2 pounds of meat which costs 3 per pound. So, the total cost for meat would be 2 * 3 = 6 Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding the cost of taco shells, bell peppers, and meat: Total cost = Taco shells cost + Bell peppers cost + Meat cost Total cost = 5 + 6 + 6 Total cost = 17 So, Pauline spent a total of 17 for the taco dinner."},{"question":"Is \\"The U.S. Supreme Court found that \\"the plain intent of Congress in enacting\\" the ESA \\"was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.\\"\\" a good answer to the question \\"Which president signed the Act into law?\\"","response":"No, that answer does not tell you which president signed the Act into law.

It is owned and operated by Moy Communications Inc. - Genpuku (), a Japanese coming-of-age ceremony modeled after an early Tang Dynasty Chinese custom, dates back to Japan's classical Nara Period (710794 AD). This ceremony marked the transition from child to adult status and the assumption of adult responsibilities. The age of participation varied throughout history and depended on factors such as sex, political climate, and social status. Most participants were aristocratic children between the ages of 10 and 20, and most descriptions of genpuku focus on the male ceremony rather that the female ceremony due to the exclusion of women from politically important court positions and warrior status. Important changes in clothing and hairstyle typically denoted this transition, for both men and women. Youth and children were often synonymous, and a period of adolescence was not often present throughout the periods in which traditional genpuku flourished. The etymology of the word, which is atypical, reflects the major points of genpuku ceremonial format; in this case \\"gen\\" ()means \\"head\\" and \\"fuku\\" () means \\"wearing\\". The ceremony is also known as kakan (), uikburi (), kanrei (), shufuku (), and hatsu-motoyui (). - The , also known as the , is the westernmost region of Honsh, the largest island of Japan.

He was adopted by Hideyoshi and called himself Hashu Hidetoshi ( ) and Shusen ( ) . He was then again adopted by Kobayakawa Takakage and renamed himself Hideaki . Because he had gained the rank of Saemon no Kami ( ) or in China Shikkingo ( ) at genpuku and held the title of Chunagon ( ) , Hideaki was also called Kingo Chunagon ( ) . During the Battle of Keicho he led reinforcements to rescue Ulsan Castle from the Ming army . Fighting on the front line with a spear , he managed to capture an enemy commander and broke the siege . However , Hideyoshi saw the danger of a reckless charge by the general commanding an army and deprived him of his domain , Chikugo after returning . Kobayakawa , angered by this , believed the lie circulated by Tokugawa Ieyasu that this had been the doing of a jealous Ishida Mitsunari . He never forgot or forgave Mitsunari and worked to undermine his position . Moreover , Kobayakawa was known to attack women and children during the campaign , an act that is despised by many of his fellow commanders . Before the battle of Sekigahara , Kobayakawa happened to be in Osaka and acted as though he would go along with Mitsunari , even though he had intended to betray him , having secretly communicated with Ieyasu . Knowing Kobayakawa held ill feelings , Mitsunari and tani Yoshitsugu promised him two additional domains around Osaka and the position of kampaku ( until Toyotomi Hideyori grew old enough to rule ) if he helped them to victory .

(ii). positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? even better","response":"The phrase \\"even better\\" can be considered positive. This assessment is based on the context and the words used in the phrase. Let's analyze the words and typical usage of the expression to understand why it is positive. 1. \\"Even\\": The word \\"even\\" is used here to show emphasis and to signify an enhanced degree of the quality being described. In this case, it suggests a comparison with something else, which is considered good or acceptable. As a result, the presence of \\"even\\" in the phrase implies an improvement on the existing situation or standard. 2. \\"Better\\": The word \\"better\\" is a comparative adjective derived from \\"good.\\" It portrays an improved circumstance, situation, or experience. When something is \\"better,\\" it means that it is more preferable, superior, or advantageous compared to another item, experience, or state. In most contexts, using the phrase \\"even better\\" indicates that a situation or outcome has surpassed expectations, marking an improvement in comparison to a previously discussed or implied event, status, or condition. For instance, let's consider a few examples of how the phrase \\"even better\\" might be used: - \\"I enjoyed our last vacation, but this one was even better.\\" - \\"The new version of the software is even better than its predecessor.\\" - \\"Their latest performance was even better than what we saw in the rehearsal.\\" In each of these examples, the phrase \\"even better\\" highlights a positive aspect or improvement.

The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad. That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer. Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up. Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911. The two then returned with some blankets to cover Ms. St. Onge, while they waited for the ambulance to arrive.

The formation of more cracks is not a direct change to any step listed in the process but can contribute to increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere in an indirect manner.

While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. Question: How did the author come up with the idea to write the book? === The answer to the above question is A:","response":"The author likely came up with the idea to write the book \\"Dealing With Disrespect\\" due to their own personal experiences and observations of the negative aspects of the growth of the Internet. As more people started to share their creative works and ideas online, they noticed that an unfortunate side effect was the rise of mean-spirited, disrespectful, and malicious comments from some users. Having been troubled by this issue for a while, the author likely experienced the challenging nature of handling such negative feedback first-hand and realized that there were others who could benefit from guidance in dealing with these situations. They saw the need for a resource that could help people put such hurtful comments into perspective and manage any negative emotions arising from them. By writing this book, the author aimed to provide a tool that could help people become better communicators themselves, as well as help them identify legitimate criticism amongst the disrespectful remarks. It's possible that the author also may have drawn inspiration from others who experienced these challenges or even witnessed people giving up on sharing their creativity due to the fear of backlash from the internet. Ultimately, the desire to make a positive change and provide support for those who may be struggling with these issues likely drove the author to create \\"Dealing With Disrespect,\\" offering readers a means to handle and process non-constructive and hurtful feedback online."},{"question":"Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers.

He was the son of Meyer Kubelsky and Emma Sachs Kubelsky. His parents were Jewish. Meyer was a saloon owner and later a haberdasher who had emigrated to America from Poland. Benny had been a minor vaudeville performer before becoming a national figure with The Jack Benny Program, a weekly radio show that ran from 1932 to 1948 on NBC and from 1949 to 1955 on CBS. It was among the most highly rated programs during its run. Benny's long radio career began on April 6, 1932, when the NBC Commercial Program Department auditioned him for the N.W. Ayer agency and their client, Canada Dry, after which Bertha Brainard, head of the division, said, \\"We think Mr. Benny is excellent for radio and, while the audition was unassisted as far as orchestra was concerned, we believe he would make a great bet for an air program.\\" Recalling the experience in 1956, Benny said Ed Sullivan had invited him to guest on his program (1932), and \\"the agency for Canada Dry ginger ale heard me and offered me a job.\\" With Canada Dry ginger ale as a sponsor, Benny came to radio on The Canada Dry Program, on May 2, 1932, on the NBC Blue Network and continuing for six months until October 26, moving to CBS on October 30. With Ted Weems leading the band, Benny stayed on CBS until January 26, 1933. Arriving at NBC on March 17, Benny did The Chevrolet Program until April 1, 1934. He continued with sponsor General Tire through the end of the season. In October, 1934, General Foods, the makers of Jell-O and Grape-Nuts, became the sponsor strongly identified with Benny for 10 years. American Tobacco's Lucky Strike was his longest-lasting radio sponsor, from October 1944 through to the end of his original radio series. The show switched networks to CBS on January 2, 1949, as part of CBS president William S. Paley's notorious \\"raid\\" of NBC talent in 1948-49. It stayed there for the remainder of its radio run, ending on May 22, 1955. CBS aired repeat episodes from 1956 to 1958 as The Best of Benny. What was something interesting Jack Benny did in this period?","response":"An interesting thing Jack Benny did in this period was that he successfully transitioned his radio show, The Jack Benny Program, between different networks and sponsors. The show started on the NBC Blue Network with Canada Dry as its sponsor, then moved to CBS, back to NBC with various sponsors such as General Tire, General Foods, and finally American Tobacco's Lucky Strike, before switching to CBS again.

Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea?

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles. After reading the above, is \\"The generals changed their minds\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections about the AC-130 Option?\\"?","response":"Yes, \\"The generals changed their minds\\" could be a simple way to explain the most likely reason for the two generals having different memories about the AC-130 option.

Suggested answer: Frida Kahlo de Rivera (born Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón; July 6, 1907 – July 13, 1954) was a Mexican painter , born in Coyoacán , who is best known for her self-portraits. Should I validate this answer? A:","response":"The suggested answer provides some background information about Frida Kahlo but does not specifically address the question of how she died. To provide a more accurate and comprehensive answer to the question, the following information should be included: Frida Kahlo, the renowned Mexican painter, passed away on July 13, 1954. Although the exact cause of her death remains somewhat uncertain, the official cause was given as a pulmonary embolism. It is important to note that Kahlo had endured numerous health issues throughout her life, which could have potentially contributed to her death. Born in Coyoacán, Mexico on July 6, 1907, Kahlo experienced a tumultuous life filled with illness and injury. At the young age of six, she contracted polio, which left her with a withered and weakened right leg. Later, in 1925, she was involved in a serious bus accident that left her with severe injuries, including fractures in her spine, pelvis, and ribs, and a shattered right leg. This accident would have lasting effects on her life, leading to more than 30 surgical interventions and chronic, debilitating pain. In addition to her physical health issues, Kahlo also faced mental health struggles, including depression and anxiety. The physical and emotional pain she experienced was often depicted in her art, making her paintings intensely personal and reflective of her reality. Throughout her life, Kahlo was hospitalized multiple times for various health issues, and in 1950, she underwent spinal surgery. Unfortunately, this surgery did not provide relief from her chronic pain, and she would continue to be hospitalized in the years leading up to her death. In the last months of her life, Kahlo's health deteriorated rapidly, and her leg was amputated due to gangrene. Some biographers have also suggested that she may have had other medical conditions, such as spina bifida or multiple sclerosis, which could have contributed to her declining health. Given the political climate in Mexico and her romantic relationship with Leon Trotsky, some have speculated that her death was not as straightforward as officially claimed. Rumors of suicide have circulated, given her fragile mental health and the fact that she had previously attempted to take her own life. However, despite these speculations, the official cause of her death remains listed as a pulmonary embolism. In conclusion, while the suggested answer provides useful information about Frida Kahlo's life and career, it does not directly address how she died. An accurate and comprehensive answer should include her cause of death, as well as the various health issues and personal struggles she faced that may have contributed to it, such as the pulmonary embolism, her physical disabilities and chronic pain, and her mental health disorders."},{"question":"Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container - The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol - A:","response":"The missing first step is: Choose the type of grapes for the specific wine being produced."},{"question":"Q: Given a statement about date and time, state whether the statement is true or false.

The output should be either 'True' or 'False'. August 26, 2003 occured after 14 January 2000 but before Aug 19, 1983 A:","response":"Part #1: Understand the date and time statement and identify the template. Usage: In this example, the date and time statement is \\"August 26, 2003 occured after 14 January 2000 but before Aug 19, 1983\\". The identified template is \\"t1 occured after t2 but before t3\\". This statement fits this template because t1 (August 26, 2003) is being compared as occurring after t2 (14 January 2000) and before t3 (Aug 19, 1983). Part #2: Convert the date and time string values into a comparable format. Usage: In this example, you would convert the three date strings \\"August 26, 2003\\", \\"14 January 2000\\", and \\"Aug 19, 1983\\" into a desired format, such as YYYY-MM-DD. The converted date strings would be \\"2003-08-26\\", \\"2000-01-14\\", and \\"1983-08-19\\", respectively. Part #3: Compare t1 with t2 and t3 according to the given statement. Usage: For the statement \\"August 26, 2003 occured after 14 January 2000 but before Aug 19, 1983\\", we see that t1 (2003-08-26) actually occurs after t2 (2000-01-14) and after t3 (1983-08-19). Part #4: Determine the truthfulness of the statement based on the comparison. Usage: In this case, the statement \\"August 26, 2003 occured after 14 January 2000 but before Aug 19, 1983\\" is False. This is because, although t1 (2003-08-26) does occur after t2 (2000-01-14), it does not occur before t3 (1983-08-19) as stated in the input."},{"question":"Potom budete muset odběhat pár koleček, pokud nevezmete tu knihu a nepřizpůsobíte se našim požadavkům.

Агентство США по международному развитию (USAID) подошло к решению этой задачи весьма основательно. Первым шагом стало предоставление специализированного программного обеспечения для анализа и моделирования электросетей. С помощью этого инструмента национальные энергетические компании смогли точнее оценить потребность в передаче электроэнергии, учесть особенности своих энергосистем и идентифицировать возможные узкие места и проблемы. Во второй части проекта, USAID организовало обучающие сессии и семинары для сотрудников национальных энергетических компаний по применению предоставленного программного обеспечения и разработке стратегий в области энергетики. Это позволило специалистам углубить свои знания в области энергоинформатики, а также научиться составлять долгосрочные и краткосрочные планы по обеспечению надежного функционирования электросетей. Следующим шагом было внедрение полученных знаний и опыта на практике. В результате совместной работы национальных энергетических компаний с экспертами из USAID удалось разработать стратегии управления электросетями для каждой страны. Отметим, что при создании этих стратегий учитывались не только национальные особенности, но и международные элементы, такие как региональное сотрудничество в области энергетики и обмен электроэнергией между соседними странами. Конечным этапом в реализации проекта USAID следует считать проведение экспертизы разработанных стратегий и подготовка дополнительных рекомендаций для их улучшения. Помимо этого, участники проекта активно обсуждали возможности применения новых технологий и методов управления электросетями, что способствовало генерации идей для дальнейшего развития энергосектора в регионе и повышения его конкурентоспособности на мировом рынке энергоресурсов. Таким образом, благодаря надежному и эффективному партнерству между USAID и национальными энергетическими компаниями Казахстана, Кыргызстана, Таджикистана и Узбекистана получили мощную основу для модернизации и дальнейшего развития своих систем электропередачи, что будет способствовать устойчивому росту экономики и благополучию населения в регионе."},{"question":"How to install openelec on a raspberry pi<br>Gather your supplies.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Acre is a unit of area or land measurement, which is primarily used in the United States and some Commonwealth countries. An acre represents approximately 43,560 square feet (4,047 square meters) of land. On the other hand, a square mile serves as another unit of area measurement, equal to 5,280 feet (1,609 meters) on each side. This means that a square mile is equal to 27,878,400 square feet (2,589,998 square meters). In order to find out how many acres there are in a square mile, we have to divide the total number of square feet in a square mile by the total number of square feet in an acre. So, we can calculate this as 27,878,400 square feet (in a square mile) divided by 43,560 square feet (in an acre), which equals 640.

During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story.

The mere mention of its name sparks image conjuring, from brooding castles perched atop misty hills to supernatural beings that haunt the darkest corners of your psyche, Transylvania, Romania, rings with a thrilling resonance. This land breathing with ageless lore has woven countless tales that intermingle reality and the mystical, leaving the audience entranced. Let us journey together through time's weft and delve into the mystical tales from Transylvania. Perhaps the most iconic of all Transylvanian folklore is the legend of Dracula, the infamous vampire Count. Rooted in the historical figure of Vlad the Impaler, known for his brutal and bloodthirsty reign, this character was reimagined by Bram Stoker as a shadowy, immortal vampire. The notorious Dracula's Castle, Bran Castle, standing starkly amidst the Carpathian Mountains' peaks, fuels the fear and fascination of visitors till today. The grim walls of this fortification whisper tales of the Count's nocturnal exploits, feeding the vampire lore that thrills both locals and foreigners alike. Yet, Dracula’s tale is but one thread in Transylvania’s vast tapestry of myths and legends. Transylvania's fascinating folklore is often tinged with elements of the otherworldly, and a prime illustration of this is the story of the 'Solomonari'. These legendary wizards, trained in an otherworldly school hidden in the mountains, were believed to have controlled the weather. Locals whispered that they could ride dragons, summon rain, and pull together mighty storms. The Solomonari's tales interweave the fabric of Transylvania's mystical allure, adding to its intricate narrative. The Transylvanian landscape is dotted with hauntingly beautiful forests, each one possessing its own mystical tale. Among them, the Hoia Baciu Forest, often referred to as the \\"Bermuda Triangle of Transylvania\\", is known for its eerie occurrences. Stories of unexplained phenomena, including UFO sightings, ghostly apparitions, and instances of lost time, plague this forest. Its twisted, charring vegetation and the strange sense of anxiety that besets those who dare to venture within its bounds, propagate its otherworldly influence. Another lesser-known but equally intriguing tale is that of the 'strigoi', the troubled spirits rising from the grave. These entities, subtly different from the concept of a vampire, are a vital part of rural folklore. Often entangled in tales of unrequited love and betrayal, strigois are said to wander the earth, causing unrest and torment. In the heart of Transylvania, tales of cryptic werewolves also run rampant. While the werewolf's notion is universal, Transylvanian folklore adds its unique flavor. Here, werewolves were once warriors or wronged individuals, cursed to bear their lupine affliction. Just as Dracula's myth veils every corner of Transylvania, the werewolves become a part of their everyday superstitions, further solidifying Transylvania's mystical stories. Embedded deeply within Transylvania's cultural identity, these fantastical tales form an extensive narrative that continues to allure and inspire people worldwide. Each tale, whether it’s about the solitary vampire, the legendary Solomonari, the spirit-stricken strigoi, the mysterious happenings in the Hoia Baciu forest, or the cursed werewolves, contributes to the rich tapestry of Transylvanian folklore. Transylvania's narrative pits reality against fantasy, the visceral against the ethereal, urging us to slip into a world seen through the mystical lens. These mystical tales from Transylvania, the beating heart of Europe, keep pulsating with life, mingling and intertwining with everyone who ever dares to venture into the mesmerizing world of this storied land. Imbued with tales of the supernatural and the extramundane, Transylvania offers a window into an enigmatic world that tilts the quotidian towards the magical."},{"question":"Here is an article: For a recent visiting conference, the folks at Tourisme Montreal treated attendees to a free serving of poutine from a local food truck. You can see their reactions in the YouTube video below: For those unfamiliar with this Quebecois specialty, poutine is french fries topped with gravy and cheese curds (think cottage cheese) that's often served as cold-weather comfort food or after a night of bar-hopping. It has also caught on as a trendy pub dish in other cities. As the editor of the Great American Bites column on this site, I've been exposed to -- and tempted by -- many regional specialties I had never previously known about, including St. Louis toasted ravioli, New Haven clam pizza and Chicago Italian beef. (Based on our author's description, I plan to skip Nashville hot fried chicken.) As for poutine, well, it's a gloppy mess, and a heart attack on a plate to boot. But as a repeat Montreal visitor, I can highly recommend the city's other specialty, smoked meat (brisket) sandwiches. Readers, tell us about the best regional specialties you've encountered in your travels, or plug a hometown favorite you'd recommend to a visitor.
